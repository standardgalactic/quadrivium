that you used to play as a kid? A pattern of dots was dra,
on a piece of paper and players took it in turns to join t .
the dots together. If you completed a square, you coul
your initial in it and have another go. I.Q. is a so
computerised version of boxes.
Instead o f  having squares to  complete, there a
hexagons. Each dot is surrounded by six others and if

I •Q. is that you can train your playing piece to move r
the board for you.
The piece is called a SAIL - super artiﬁcially intellige
lifeform - and it works as follows. As you make the ﬁrst few _ .
moves, the sail 'remembers' how it responded in a certain •
situation. If it encounters the same position again, it will

had the same boring look for a number
of years now, only with the recent
advent of the 64C has the tried and
tested computer had a face lift and
been made t o  look  a  little more
modern.
Owners o f  what ar e n o  doubt
grubby, scratched, coffee stained old
style cases can now give their C64s a
bright new look by replacing the case
with Slimline 6 4  f r o m  Evesham
Micros.
The case is a straight replacement
for the existing one. A l l  o f  the
computers inards being transfered to
the new one. If your old case was in the
same state as mine then the best place
for this is probably the bin.
Fitting the case is simplicity itself
and should present no problems to
anyone w ith ev en a  rudimentary
knowledge of how to hold and use a
screwdriver,
Three screws hold the C64 old style
case together, removing these and
removing the keyboard connectors
from the circuit board splits the case
into it s  t w o  c omponents . T h e
keyboard and circuit board can then
be transfered to the new case by simply
unscrewing them from the case. Once
this is done few screws simply hold the
new case together.

The Slimline 6 4  case i s  a  v as t
improvement on the old case. The
keyboard is much lower at the front
making it much easier to type on. I
hate the high keyboard on the normal
C64 and ﬁnd that it makes my wrists

suppose that this is  really personal
preference but I  d o  lik e the lower
keyboard.
C64 owner s  t h a t  h a v e  res et
switches a n d  Dolphin Dos  w ill be
pleased to know that there are holes in
the rear of the case ready made for
their associated switches. This means
that you don't have to get your electric
drill out to ﬁt them, and you certainly
don't have to have wires hanging out
the back like I've seen on many C64's.
The Slimline 64 case is a little wider
than a normal case. The area behind
the keyboard being lengthened. Be
warned, even though this area looks as

though it might be nice to support your
TV etc. on, it isn't as sturdy as it looks
as a press on the top of it will show.
The Slimline 6 4 case is  a  vast
improvement on the old style. It not
only looks nicer but does make it a lot
more comfortable in  use. M y  only
question is, why didn't someone think
of it before?

different sets of disk based educational
software, each with its own character-
istics and merits.
The ﬁrst set came from Cronos
Software, a small company based in
Ormsk irk a n d  comprised o f  tw o
mathematics programs aimed a t
opposite ends of the age spectrum.
Maths Trek sets Out to help the
junior school child t o  manipulate
numbers and arithmetical operators.
The program is set out as a board game
and the child must get the best score to
win. The idea of the game is to beat
your opponent and to get from the
start to one hundred before he does.
The opponent can b e  either the
computer o r  anther human, I n  a
manner similar to snakes and ladders;
the game allows you to  send your
opponent back squares by landing on
him and to move forward by landing
on a designated number. Skill is a
major factor i n  th i s game. Th e
computer generates three numbers (all
less than 10) and the player must use
the numbers in the order given along
with the arithmetic operators (each
only once) to generate a sum. The idea
is to create the sum which will give you
the most advantageous, although not
necessarily the highest, score. The
game does have an addictive quality
but is a little dull in presentation. More
development of the graphics is really
necessary to give a product which will
appeal to children.
The second program, Accounting
Part I  , is, as its title suggests, an
accounting tutoprial. It is aimed at '0'
and 'A' level students and those taking
other similar examinations. Th e
program acts as a simple teaching aid
offering revision and self tuition. In
content, you get a series of pages of
information interspersed w i th  test
questions which check your grasp of
the material. Whilst the program will
operate on its own, it is probably best
used with an appropriate text book.
Overall, these offerings fro m
Cronos are adequate in content but
they do have a couple of faults. First,
EDUCATION
School Room
We bring you the latest in educational software to make
those exams just that little bit easier.
By Margaret Webb
they aren't to o  exciting i n  their
presentation. Computer users are
becoming choosier nowadays and
expect more sophisticated graphics.
Because o f  the small market fo r
educational software, software houses
must pull out all the stops when
preparing programs. The American
products and many o f those on the
11I3C have shown what can be done.
Secondly, the amount of material
on the disks didn't really represent
good value at E7.95. I would expect at
least two programs of the size of Mat/is
Trek for the asking price. With budgets
being so small, schools will only buy
software which gives them value for
money.
Both of these faults can be easily
rectiﬁed and I look forward to seeing
what Cronos come up with in the
future.
The second offering, presents quite
a contrast. School Software, a
company based in Limerick, offers a
range o f  software fo r  th e  BBC,
Amstrad and 64 and, from what! have
seen, it's quite meaty in content.
A wide range o f  subjects are
covered, four of which fell through my
letter box. Alt of the programs seen
have the similar format o f optional
study notes combined w i th  test
questions. This allows you to decide
whether you are learning or revising.
Inevitably, the content is too cursory
to provide sufﬁcient detail for written
exam answers and the simultaneous
use of text books is mandatory.
Better Spelling is aimed at the eight
to a d u l t range. Th i s  program
overcomes some o f  the problems
discussed in this column in the October
issue of Your Commodore and succeeds
in teaching the subject quite well.
There is a menu of 16 items to choose
from, each dealing with a speciﬁc area.
Such subjects as plurals, preﬁxes,
silent E , tenses, particles etc. are
covered i n  a  ﬁrst group o f  nine
options. In these options, you must
type in the required word. A second
group o f  seven Options covers
common spelling errors. This time you
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
16
must till in the gap in a sentence. For
example, the use of to. two and too is
covered as is been and being. Each test
ends with a score of your performance
and the option to make a hard copy of
your printer. Some effort has gone into
making the program attractive with
the same graphical effects but it's still
not quite there.
The other three packages were
Physical Geography, M a p  Wo r k
(Britain and Ireland) and Physics 1. All
were suitable for ages for 12 years
upwards. These packages are again
split i n to  a  number o f  sections
covering various topics within each
subject. The use of graphics is much
more in evidence and is o f a better
standard.
All o f  th e  School Software
programs are of a decent length and
give you plenty t o  do. I  cannot
comment on their value for money
since the brochure I was sent didn't
have any prices (it did, however, have
an order form!). They are, however,
good quality products which perform
their purpose well.
To some extent. these packages
epitomise the problem with writing
software for education. On the one
hand, you must have input from the
teachers so  that the content and
method of presentation of the material
is sound. And, on the other hand, you
must have the abilities and creativity of
the programmer to  ensure that an
attractive and efﬁcient program is
prepared. Whilst all of the programs
discussed score quite well in the ﬁrst
area, they don't all do so well in the
second. I  feel that perhaps Cronus
should particularly note this.
Notwithstanding this caveat, these
products will teach you and they rate
quite well against the opposition. Wit

Printing c
artYe s .  e brag about the facilities provided by their
printers, but little is said about its running costs.
These days. You might easily buy a bargain printer, only
to discover that you have to pay through the nose for paper
and cartridges.
If you can't ﬁnd a model which also prints mon
perhaps you should consider the following money sa
advice.
Firstly. if you are planning to buy a printer, look for o
which accepts ordinary paper. printer paper can be two or
three times as expensive. In this respect. the Commodore
MPS f'403 is a good buy, even though its typeface is not grand.
Once you've got a printer which accepts single sheets,
you can save a fortune on those expensive cartridges by using
carbon paper, as you would on a typewriter. Simply use the
top page over and over again or print straight on to the
carbon paper. In this way, you can have up to 40 pages of
excellent printout on one page of carbon paper. costing a
couple of pence.
Finally, for run of the mill printouts like listings, use
photocopying paper which you can get for around i2 for
1000 sheets.

Congratulations, Your Commodore and especially NI ike
Healey, for the Plus/4 Dumper program which appeared in
a recent issue.
I actually wrote to the editorial department a short while
ago requesting just such a program to dump thehi-res screen
but to an NIPS 803 printer. It works very well and required
only one small alteration to make the text dump work also.
Many thanks.
would like to ask if there is any way to make the 803
double strike when printing text? Just the ability to disable
line feed would do the trick. I can't ﬁnd a way but perhaps
one of Your Connoodore's expert readers knows how to do it.
Laurenti, Cheltenham.
As far as ive know, it is not possible to get double strike on an
MPS 803 because the printer has an auto line/ed. We're glad
that everybody has fauna' the Plus/4 Dumper program so
useful. j o u  are interested in seeing a particular type of
program published, then please (Imp us a line Itith your ideas.
It'e'll do our best to oblige but ire can't promise anything.

chances next tone. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait 10
game minutes to try again as a guard is hanging around the
door. Inside the room you'll ﬁnd the odd clue mixed with a
healthy helping of red herrings and perhaps a note the
suspect has made about the time and place of a meeting.
Now you must either monitor these meetings yourself or
set up your tape surveillance to record them and gather more
clues from their conversations. At last, you should be on the
trail and it's time to question the suspects. Murder suspects
aren't particularly chatty folk and so you must shock them
into talking to you by selecting the correct fact about them
from the list of four presented to you. Get it right (you'll
probably discover the sordid details from the break in) and
you can ask key questions about who they think is in danger,
v•rho is the killer, where the murder will take place and what
the weapon will be. You can tell whether you're on the right
track by the suspects reaction. If they get worried, then you
should start listening. Keep the pressure on arid you could
ﬁnd the solution. Finally, you should consult your notes that
keep track o f break ins, phone conversations, recorded
meetings and random tip offs and then confront the would
be kiler with the facts and the most likely motive and another
case will be solved,
Unfortunately, it isn't that easy. In the harder cases some
suspects know nothing at all, others lie and in one case I had
calculated that Agatha was about to  be gunned down
because she had absconded with the proceeds from a
contract, only to ﬁnd that she gave the money back just
before L was about to make my triumphant accusation. By
this time it was too late to track down the real killer and the

Commodore 128 with its great Basic
7.0, I thought that this was the Basic
interpreter I  had been looking for
(compared to  my old C64 Basic).
How-ver, s t u e
commands and all their options, I
discovered th a t Commodore h a d
missed a small section of commands
which a r e  indispensable t o  th e
programmer. For example, the FIND
routine which is very important in
some programs, was excluded. Also
omitted was the MERGE routine to
combine programs from disk, not
forgetting the OLD, sometimes known
as the UNNEW routine, And last but
not least. th a t unknown R K IL L
command which compresses your
program by deleting all unnecessary
spaces and REMarks.
Since all these valuable commands
were not included, the only thing left
C128 U T I L I T Y  11
Utility
Commands
This program supplies 128 users with many of the vital
commands missing from Basic 7.0.
By Nagi Aanafani
for me to do was to write them myself.
I have actually managed to write a
program which doesn't interfere with
my Basic program, while still being
active all of the time.
Of course it had to be in machine
code but it also had to be accessible as
a Basic command. I used the ERROR
VECTOR which is located at S0300
and pointed i t to my own routine,
which th e n  checks th e  IN P U T
BUFFER a t S0200 i f  one o f  my
commands has been entered. If not it
simply returns to the original ROM
routine and outputs the error. If one of
the new commands has been typed
then control is passed to the correct
routine.
In Detail
Let's get down t o  details. When
control is passed to the FIND routine,
it ﬁrst checks if there is any string given
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
22
for which it should search, if not the
routine outputs SYNTAX ERROR. It'
the string is given, then the routine
compares the program to the string
and. it' it is found, the line is listed. The
Syntax for FIND is:
FIND --- statement> - f o r  strings
lo*; hich are not in quotes and
FIND "  < statement> - fo r  strings
which are in quotes.
Note: Anything which is after the ﬁrst
quote is included in the statement even
if it is a quote.
'When you are searching you can
use a •wildcard
what character should come in that
place o r  i f  you arc searching for
different words. The 'wildcard' cannot
be used in commands since these are
tokenised. The 'wildcard
left arrow key but it can be changed to

any other character i n  the Basic
Loader or in the Assembler/Editor
listing.
Here are some examples:
FIND
GETKEY:
FIND AS:
FIND
"BASIC:
FIND A S:
FIND
"H LE:
ﬁnds all occurences of the
CiETKEY command.
ﬁnds all occurences of the
variable A$.
ﬁnds all occurences of the
word BASIC in quotes.
ﬁnds all occurences o f
any string-variable that
starts with an A; eg: AM.
A IS. A1S,
Finds all occurences o f
words i n  quotes l i ke
'HELLO'. 'H A L L O',
'HILLY', etc.
The MERGE routine also checks the
INPUT BUFFER for a name if it is not
given or it is given a wrong syntax, then
the corresponding error is printed, The
routine works by reading in one line at
a time, storing i t  i n  the INPUT
BUFFER and then using the ROM
routine to insert the line into your
correct program. In other words the
routine acts as i f lines are inputted
from the keyboard, but reads them
from disk, Syntax o f the MERGE
command is:
MERGE " <ﬁlename>
Note: The second quote does not have
to be entered. The length o f  the
ﬁlename m u s t n o t  exceed 1 6

characters.
Examples:
MERGE "SETUP": merge the ﬁle
'SETUP'.
MERGE "* : merge the ﬁrst ﬁle on
disk.
The easiest command i s OLD.
When this routine is executed the
pointers at the beginning of the Basic
program, which are set to zero after a
NEW command, are set to a non zero
number. Then a ROM routine is used
to rechain all the Basic program. The
end of the program is calculated and
then a CLR is performed. The syntax
is:
OLD
Note: No parameters are needed!
Now comes the RK ILL command.
This routine, like the MERGE routine,
takes quite a lot of time to ﬁnish. This
is because the whole Basic program is
re-entered by using the same ROM
routines as the MERGE command. All
the unnecessary spaces and REMarks
are deleted out of the line and it is then
entered. Its syntax is:
RKILL
Note: No parameters are needed!

Basic loader and the other is an
assembler/editor listing.
In the Basic loader the machine
code is entered as DATA statements
and, at the end of each line, there is a
checksum which should prevent typing
mistakes.
First you are asked to enter the
start location where the program
should reside. It is usually located at
$1300 through SI6BE. This is memory
that the Basic Interpreter doesn't use
and unless you are certain that there is
enough space elsewhere (approx-
imately SO3BE bytes), the start location
shouldn't be changed.
If, however, th e  program i s
redirected t o  another memory
location, the Basic loader repoints all
vectors to the correct location. You are
then asked if you want to change the
'wildcard' (used b y  FIN D )  and
whether you want t o  retitle the
commands.
The Basic loader then asks you if
you want to save it. If yes. then enter
the ﬁlename you want to use. When
you have a copy of the machine code
on disk you can load and initialise it
immediately w i t h  t h e  B O O T
command (enter B O O T "  <  ﬁle-
name >").
The assembler/editor listing is for
use with the assembler program found
in Your Commodore July/September
1987 issues called Assembler 128. I
have included many remarks in that
listing for any advanced programmers.

Mac-like icons, pull down menus and
trash calls.
Unfortunately. the standard Geos
disk contained only limited software to
use these icons and menus and so the
enthusiasm waned and Geos gathered
dust. Was an operating system that was
to be bundled with the 64C! destined
for obscurity as users returned to less
friendly but practical programs? No!
Just as all seemed lost, Berkley has
released an updated version of Geos
and three new packages to put Geos to
work.

GEOS but also extends the ﬂexibility
of the productivity programs Print

Although fun to use, these programs
have serious restrictions limiting the
positioning of graphics and size and
style of text. By using the text grabber
GEO.S' can "steal" any Print Master.

store it in a photo scrap or album. This
can then be altered by geoPaint and

The icon editor may at ﬁrst sight be
just a was to customise your work disk
by redesigning the desk top icons but it
has a more serious application. Using
this utility non GEO.S• programs can be

The pages take up a full screen and can

The ﬁnal program included in Desk

GEOS Updates
To add to the confusion of installation
and ﬁle copying, each disk (except the
fontpack) contains an updated version
of the desktop (version 1.3), new input
drivers to support the Koala Pad and
some mice, although not the Neos
Mouse bundled with the (4C,geoWrite
1.3 which is basically the original text
handler with single key commands and
a slightly improved version o f
geoPaint.
Conclusions
These three new utilities and ﬁrst font
pack add a new lease o f life to the
Mac-like operating system GEOS.
Although each pack has something
new to  offer I  found the text and
graphics grabbers to be the most useful
and may be enough to persuade C64
owners to convert totally to GROS.
This is helped by the inclusion of a full
wordprocessor in geoWrite 2..0, the
added IF and IF, ELSE conditions
possible in geoMerge and the icon
editor that converts programs so they
can be run from the GEOS desktop.

C
themselves as valuable tools for two
main reasons. Firstly, because they are
able to make 'decisions' and secondly,
because they can repeat operations
with pr ec is ion a n d  ac c ur ac y .
Therefore they are extremely good at
doing the very jobs which people ﬁnd
tedious.
In Basic you instruct the computer
to make decisions, by using the " I F _
THEN" statement. A  well-known
method of creating a loop in Basic is
the " F O R . . .  • O _  N E X T "
combination of statements.
In this article, I will explain how to
do both these jobs in machine code.
For this purpose we continue with the
program theme we started in the last
article, in which we printed a character
- or output it - to the screen. Now we
want to do the same thing 256 times,
thus ﬁlling the ﬁrst quarter o f  the
screen.
Theory
Why only the ﬁrst 256 positions and
not the whole screen as well?
As I have already pointed out, the
6510 is strictly an 8-bit animal, that
means, most of its registers consist of
eight binary bits which allow you to
enter numbers only in the range from
zero to 225. Put any number larger
than 255 in any of its registers, and you
will get an 'overﬂow'. That is, instead
of 1000, which we would need in order
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
Moving deeper into machine code programming we get
things started by creating a loop and ﬁnd out how the
6510 makes decisions.
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
to ﬁll the whole screen, you will have
only 2 3 2  i n  t h e  register (100(1-
( 3
This does not mean that we can't
deal at all with larger numbers on the
6510. I t  only  means that doing so
becomes a  b i t  m o r e  inv olv ed.
Therefore. I  w o n ' t  deal w it h  t h e
procedure at this point.
Task 2
Listing I  gives y ou the source ﬁle
which will do the task I have set,
Please note that I have added some
"empty" lines -  consisting only  o f
linenumber and semicolon - and some
remarks to this listing. I  did this in
order to introduce you from the start
to good techniques o f  formatting
assembly lines. After all, you still want
to be able to understand your program
in thr ee weeks time! A n d  since
assembly listings a r e  muc h mo r e
monotonous than Basic listings, it is
even mor e important i n  assembly
programming t o  ac quir e g o o d
programming habits. Of course. when
writing a program, you will probably
be far  too keen t o  get y our ideas
working t o  concentrate o n  s uc h
mundane chores as  formulating a
remarks. But believe me, when all the
excitement has died down and your
dreary job is to ﬁnd a bug, you will be
grateful t o  y our s elf f o r  hav ing
followed this advice!
Incidentally, in  assembly listings
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
29
the semicolon is used like the REM
statement i n  Bas ic . I t  t ells  t h e
assembler that what follows can be
ignored.
In line 60 1 call a routine in the
Commodore Kemal (the second part
of the operating system which starts at
57344) in order to clear the screen.
The assembly-instruction J S R
stands for "Jump to SubRoutine" and
is very similar to the Basic GOSUB
command. W e  w ill deal w ith this
instruction in more depth at a later
stage, w h e n  w e  a ls o  w i l l  d e a l
extensively with how to make use of
the handy routines in the two RUMS
of the C64 for your own programming
purposes.
Labels
In Listing 1. I have also introduced a
very impor tant programming t o o l
which all assemblers worth their  salt
allow you to use: labels.
A label is simply a name you stick
on a  certain variable, as you do in
Basic. In line 30 I set the value "1024"
(beginning of screen memory) to the
label "SCREENMEN1". I do this with
another o n e  o f  thos e ps eudo-
instructions which are only relevant to
the assembler: EQU. This is short for
equals, and in Basic you would do the
same thing b y  writing a  line like:
SCREEN = 1024.
As in Basic most assemblers have
certain rules concerning labels. A label

may not exceed a length of between six
and nine characters (depending upon
the particular assembler you are
using), a label may not start with a
number, the characters afterwards
may n o t contain certain graphic
characters and some assemblers do not
allow you to use op-code mnemonics
or pseudo-instructions within a label.
But the most important rule is, that
a label may not be used twice. This
makes sense, because you can't expect
the assembler to assign different values
to identical labels in the "eeny, meeny,
miny, me" fashion.
Labels As Jump-Values
There is an even more useful way in
which labels i n assembly language
programming are employed.
Some Basic dialects (but not the
rather poor Basic on C64) allow you to
write a  l i n e ,  l i k e :  G O T O
PR INTROUTINE I n  th i s  case
" P R I N T
variable which you have to declare,
just like any other variable, at the
beginning of your program with a line,
like: LET PRINTROUTINE = 1000.
This is then processed like any
other variable, and when the Basic
interpreter arrives at the GOTO line, it
ﬁnds the value 1000, takes it as a line
number and jumps to it.
Now, as we have learned in the last
article, the microprocessor does not
deal in line numbers. Instead it deals
in memory locations which it keeps
track o f in its program counter. In
assembly listings we use line numbers
only for our own beneﬁt, to make our
listings more structured, and for the
beneﬁt o f the screen editor o f the
assembler program. so that i t can
insert or delete lines.
In machine code we tell the micro-
processor to  jump or branch to  a
certain location, and the assembler
allows us to declare that location on
the left hand side o f the assembly
listing in the form of a label.
And here an assembler makes life
really easy for us: In line 90 I have
declared the label PRINTLOOP by
throwing it Out on the left hand side,
do n o t necessarily kn o w  which
location the following instruction is at
- unless I  go to  all the trouble o f
counting it out. But there is no need for
that because I have set the overall start
loction in the ﬁrst line to 49152, and
this is all that's needed_ The assembler
does the rest.
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G
When it comes to the label PRINT-
LOOP, it will take the current location
address, which i t has arrived at by
assembling the preceding lines, set it to
the label PRINTLOOP and store the
label and its value in a special area of
memory, called the symbol table.
Then i t goes on assembling as
usual, until it comes to line 140 in our
program. There i t ﬁnds a branch-
instruction (more about this later) and
a label which it will promptly identify
as the label which i t previously has
stored in the symbol table. Now all it
has to do is to recover the value and
write that as the jump - or branch -
destination into the next location, and
the microprocessor will know, where
to jump to.
All this time we were on easy street.
We did not have to remember yet
another number. We did not even have
to calculate that number! Instead
we were able to use a nice, memorable
word of our own choice, which even
serves us as a sort of remark!
Compare t h a t  w i t h  t h e
unstructured ways o f  most Basic
dialects, and you will understand why
yours truly prefers to  program i n
assembly language!
Index Registers
In line 8 0  o f  Listing I  w e  are
introduced to the X-register which is
the second of the three programmable
registers of the 6510. The third is the Y-
register. Both the X-register and the Y-
register are called index registers and
are used in similar ways.
Like the A-register or accumlator
the index registers are 8-bit registers,
that is, they are able to hold numbers
in the range of zero to 255. But unlike
the A-register, the index registers are
not used for adding or subtracting
numbers. In fact, all you can do with
them, besides loading or unloading
them, is increment or decrement their
contents by one. This makes them
quite unsuitable f o r  arithmetical
operations. Instead the index registers
are used as a kind of moving pointer.
which allows th e  programmer t o
deﬁne the input or output addresses in
a ﬂexible way.
But instead of confusing you with
more clever deﬁnitions, let's look
again at the listing of our program
example:
In line 80 I load the X-register with
zero, using a similar input instruction
to the LDA instruction which we have
introduced in the last article. L D X
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
30
stands for Load the X-register with...
Our taks is, as you will remember,
to print some "A"s at the ﬁrst 2.56
positions of the screen. We could do
this job the hard way by making use of
what we have learned already and
writing a program something like this:
10 LDA I
20 STA 1024
30 STA 1025
40 STA 1026
etc.
This i s o f  course an absurdly
laborious way of doing it and would
require 256 lines of assembly in order
to ﬁll the 256 screen positions.
You may already have an inkling of
what the answer to our problem might
be -  at least in Basic. We have to
construct some kind o f loop which
starts off with 1024 and increments this
value by one with each pass through
the loop.
This is where the X -  o r  index
register comes in. In line O. the X-
register is loaded with zero. Then the
loop is entered, which we may name
after the label PRINTLOOP.
In line 90, the A-register is loaded
with one, which stands of course for
the letter "A". This needs to be output
to th e  screen memory locations,
starting from 1024 (here described
with the label SCREENMEMORY).
The X after the comma stands for
the X-register, and i f you substitute
that comma in your mind for a +, you
know at once, what this construction is
all about. We  instruct the micro-
processor to add the value in the X-
register to the absolute address given
after STA. And since the value in the
X-register at this point is zero, the
microprocessor w i l l  arrive a t  the
location 1024+0=1024.
In line 130, the X-register i s
incremented by one, using the very
simple instruction 1NX, which stands
for INcrement the contents of the X-
register (by one'''.
In line 140, the "PRINTLOOP" is
closed by using a conditional branch
instruction (more about this i n  a
minute), which has in this example, a
very similar effect t o  th e  Basic
command: IF X < > 0 THEN GOTO
90.
The program now loops back to
line 90. In line 100, the contents of the

X-register are again added to the value
1024, which is hiding behind the label
SCREENMEM. Arid since the X -
register now contains one, the micro-
processor calculates th e  output
address as 1024+ 1
outputs the letter A to the next screen
position.
The confusing bit of the instruction
STA SCREENMEM,X for the novice
is the comma after SCREENMEM.
Above I suggested for clariﬁcation to
substitute this comma in your mind
with a plus sign, This brings us to the
question: why can't a plus sign be used
in the ﬁrst place?
There are indeed occasions where
you use a plus sign, but this, even
though serving a  similar function,
constitutes a different situation, as far
as the assembler is concerned: LDA
SCREENMEM,X is to be translated
into a  full-blown machine code
instruction which the microprocessor
will calculate, as I  have described
above, and then execute.
On t h e  o th e r  h a n d , L D A
SCREENMEM+ 1, for example. which
is quite legitimate w i t h  m o s t
assemblers, will in practice be treated
differently. It will be calculated by the
assembler and n o t b y  the micro-
processor. All the microprocessor will
get, is 1025 and before that the op-code
141, and that, as you will recognise
from the assembler listing I gave you in
the last article, is good old absolute
addressing.
In the next two lines(110 and 120)a
similar command with the colour
memory makes the "A"s visible on the
screen for those o f  you who, like
myself, still have the old ROM.
Branch-Instructions
In line 140 we'close our loop by using a
so-called relative branch-instruction.
BNE stands for "Branch i f  Not
Equal" and i s a  sort o f  GOTO
combined w i th  a n  I F .  T H E N
instruction. As a matter o f fact, in
Basic you might put the whole thing in
a line like this: I F  X  < >0 THEN
GOTO...
"Relative" means, that the length
of the jump and the direction is deﬁned
in rather a special way. Instead o f
giving the full destination address to
the microprocessor, the distance
between the branch-instruction and
the destination, where the branch is
going to, is given in bytes.
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G
In our program this distance is 13
bytes long, and that includes the
branch-instruction itself, since the
program counter of the 6510 is always
pointing at the next instruction (in our
case RTS) when the whole instruction
is executed.
And since we have to branch (or
jump) backwards this is subtracted
from 256, giving 243. This is called a
negative number i n  machine code
terms, even though, strictly speaking
there are no negative numbers i n
machine coding. But in order to be
able a t  least t o  imitate negative
numbers, one uses the rather strange
convention o f splitting the available
256 numbers in a byte into two and
calls number zero to 127 positive and
numbers 128 to 255 negative.
These conventions are rather
confusing to the novice, because at
school we all learned that a negative
number has a minus sign in front of it,
Now we learn that it is a number larger
than 127.
What's it all about?
When we teamed algebra at school, we
dealt w i th  negative and positive
numbers of any size, that is numbers in
the range o f minus inﬁnity to plus
inﬁnity. Such a range is impractical for
an 8-bit microprocessor which can
only deal with numbers in the range of
zero t o  2 5 5  (even though b y
programming it the right way, you can
make i t  deal with practically any
number, positive as well as negative).
And since a microprocessor hasn't
got a register that shows if a number is
positive or negative (that would be a
waste of valuable ship-space), we now
have to  learn the convention that
under certain circumstances, quite
arbitrarily, numbers in the range o f
zero to 127 are said to be positive,
while numbers in the range of 128 to
255 are said to  be negative. Just
because it suits micro-technology.
As far as our branch-instructions
are concerned, this means of course,
that they are limited to 128 byte jumps
either way, If you want to jump any
further than that, you have to use a
combination o f  a  relative branch
instruction and an absolute jump-
instruction, which allows you to jump
from anywhere to  anywhere in the
computer.
Since these jump-instructions are
so simple, we might as well include
YOUR COMMODORE juts
31
them there: JMP 50000, for example,
stands for "JUMP to location 50000".
But w h y  use relative branch
instructions at all and not absolute
jumps, as described above?
Relative jumps need only two bytes
to give the instruction (the instruction
itself and the "offset", as it is called,
which requires only one byte), while
absolute jumps require three bytes
(instruction plus low byte plus high
byte).
Computers like the C64 haven't got
an unlimited amount of RAM, and in a
very long machine code program those
saved bytes add up very quickly, as you
‘krill ﬁnd out.
Furthermore, if you want a jump
with a condition attached to it, the
6510, ever the simple creature, does
not support any conditional absolute
j Li cups.
The Processor Status Register
This brings me neatly to the last thing
we want to deal with in this article. The
conditional aspect o f  the branch-
instruction BNE, which we've used in
line 140 of our program.
The microprocessor, as we have
learned, is the real computer, and must
have some inbuilt facility to  make
decisions.
This decision-making register, i f
you like, is called the Processor Status
Register (PS f o r  short) o r  more
commonly the ﬂag register.
Strictly speaking it's not a decision-
making register at all, but a sort of
electronic notepad which is updated
every time the 6510 has executed an
instruction.
It's very simple, really: Like most
registers in the 6510 the PS-register is
just another location consisting o f
eight binary bits. Those eight binary
bits make up any number in the range
between zero and 255, but, unlike the
other registers, the whole number isn't
of any interest here. Instead the eight
binary bits are treated separately and a
special function is assigned to each of
them.
This special function is called a
ﬂag, and like any other binary bits
there are two states in which you can
ﬁnd a ﬂag: It can either be set (=l)or it
can be clear (=0). If the ﬂag is set, then
we say, that the condition, which is
attached to this particular ﬂag is met
(Yes). If. on the other hand, the ﬂag is
clear, then we say, that the condition is
not met (No).

Different ﬂags are tied to different
conditions: The most often used ﬂag of
the 6510 is the zero-ﬂag. It tells if a
result of an input or output operation
or an arithmetical operation is zero or
not zero.
Most o f the instructions for the
6510 have an inﬂuence on the zero-
ﬂag. If, for example, you load the
accumulator with zero, the zero-ﬂag
will be set, because the condition of the
ﬂag is being met. I f  you load the
accumulator with any number in the
range from one to 255, the zero-ﬂag
will b e  cleared, because now the
condition o f  the ﬂag is not met.
Equally, if you subtract 10 from 10, the
ﬂag again will be set while, if you add
10 plus 10, the ﬂag will be cleared.
The slightly confusing aspect of the
zero-ﬂag is that it is SET if the result is
zero and that it is CLEAR if the result
is not zero! So, remember this well!
The use of all this becomes clear in
our program. We start off with the x-
register containing zero, and with each
pass through our loop, we increment x
by one. This means of course, that the
content in x  is always not zero or
greater than zero, and that in turn
results in the program branching badt
ot PRINTLOOP, because the BNE-
instruction implies: "Branch, i f  the
result is not equal, that is, if the zero-
ﬂag is not set."
The moment the zero-ﬂag was set,
the microprocessor would continue in
a straight line and end up with the
RTS-instruction in line 160, and that
means, of course, that our program is
ﬁnished.
When does x actually become zero,
when we are constantly adding one to
it?
It becomes zero the moment the
full capacity of the 8-bit x-register has
been reached. And this happens, of
course, when we add 1+255=256, if
you include the zero as one usually
does in computers. Because then, like
the mileage counter i n  a  car, the
register starts from zero again, and this
means, that the zero-ﬂag will be set,
the condition of the BNE-instruction is
not being met any more and the 6510
zooms straight through to the exit in
line 160.
Incidentally, of the eight ﬂag-bits
in the PS-register, two are never used,
and from the remaining six bits, only
two ( o r  perhaps three) are used
regularly in program applications. The
other three bits are only used in ever
specialised applications, and it will be

a long, long time, before you use any of
them — if you ever do.
Finally
In Figure 1 is a list of all the op-codes I
have introduced so far and their full
meaning. I  also add most of the op-
codes concerning the x-register and the
y-register. In the context of what we
have dealt with in this article, the Y-
register does exactly the same thing as
the x-register. As a matter of fact, in
Listing II could have used Y instead of
X,
Listing 2  gives you the Basic
equivalent o f  o u r  machine code
program. I thought I might add this, so
that y o u  ca n  have a  practical wo
demonstration o f  the difference in 1
speed between Basic and machine
code.
Next time you might be able to
impress yo u r friends even more
because then we will expand on our
programming theme one ﬁnal step
further and ﬁll the whole screen. By
then you will already have been
introduced to the most widely used
instructions o f the 6510 and might
even be able to start writing your own
programs.

D
complexity of the programs that are
published in Your Commodore, many
people ﬁnd that once they have typed
them in they do not work. Usually, this
is not the fault of the magazine but
rather due to the program being typed
in incorrectly.
To help readers, we do provide a
Software for Sale service that makes all
of the software from each month
available o n  d i s k  o r  cassette.
Unfortunately because of duplication
problems we are only able to provide
C16 and Plus/4 programs on our
monthly disk. Now, however we are
able to produce our latest Plus/4 and
C16 Software offer for both disk and
tape users.
Documentation
All the programs that are on the tape
are fr o m  recent issues o f  Your
Commodore. Should you not happen
to have access to any of the relevant
articles then you can purchase back
issues of the magazine from:
Infonet Ltd: Times House, 179 The
Marlowes, Hemel Hempstead, Herts
HP! I  BB. Tel: (0442) 48435.
The cost o f a back issue is E1.50
including postage and packing.
What Do You Get?
So just what is on the latest Software
cassette or disk?
Do you want to use some of our programs but can't
afford the time to type them in? Our latest software
offer comes to the rescue.
Word-Pro Add-On
This program is for use with the in-
built wordprocessing software on a
Plus/4. Th e  program produces
descenders on an MPS 801 or 803
printer. Both of which don't usually
print descenders below the level of all
of th e  o th e r characters. Using
descenders gives your letters etc. a
much more professional feel.
This program will only work with a
disk drive for LOAD. SAVE etc. You
can however still use the software for
typing text though you will not be able
to SAVE any information.
Spelling Checker
Another useful addition to the in-built
wordprocessor on the Plus/4. This
program works in conjunction with a
disk drive, NOT TAPE, and will build
up its own dictionary of words as you
use it. The program will go through
any text ﬁle that you have created and
highlight any words that are not in the
dictionary so that you can correct
them if the spelling is wrong or tell the
program t o  add the word to  i ts
dictionary if the spelling is correct.
Cribbage
If you've ever played cribbage then
you'll k now just what an addictive
game it is. If you haven't then try our
Plus/4 version of the game_
This comOuter version o f  the
popular card game lets you battle it out

with the computer rather than an othe
player.
Lower Case Graphics
Anyone familiar with the C16 o
Plus/4 will know that there are two
character sets available, an uppe
case/graphics s e t a n d  a  Lowe
case/upper case set. When it comes to
graphics modes however, you are only
allowed to use the upper case set.
This short program demonstrates
how you can access the lowercase set
while in a graphics mode improving
the way that your graphic screens look.
Character Editor
This character editor allows you to
design your own characters with ease
and save them on to tape or disk for
use at a later date within your own
programs.
Also included on the cassette or
disk a r e  a  number  o f  different
character sets that you can use as they
are or modify using the editor. There is
even a program that explains just how
you g e t  a b o u t  us ing y o u r  o w n
character s ets  w it h in  y o u r  o w n
programs.
Dual Programming
This program allows you to have more
than one program in the memory o
your Plus/4 at one time. Switching
between the programs is  simply a
matter of pressing a couple of keys.

This Month
Not only are all of the above programs
available on the tape or disk but all of
the programs i n  this issue o f  the
magazine will also be placed on it.
C16's and Memory Expansion
The C 16 and Plus/4 computers are
almost identical, except for the fact
that the C16 has far less memory than
the Plus/4. This compatibility means
that programs f o r  one o f  these
computers will usually work on the
other computer if enough memory is
available.
A number of companies produce
memory expansion cartridges for the
C It) that expand its memory to varying
degrees. I f  you have one o f  these
cartridges then a l l  o f  the above
programs should work with the C16,
except of course, those that use the
Plus/4's built in software.
S oftw ar e f o r  S a l e
How Much Do They Cost?
The price of the software is 1;4.00 for
cassette and E6.00 for a disk.

tips, articles and even regular series, In
fact i f  you have something that you
think could be of use to other Commo-

follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
I) I f  possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a mar gin o f  about 1 0  characters

put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required — disk. printer

For ex ample, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on CM interrupts.
You should put something lik e the
following at the head of the page:
terruptsil Smtt Ft/ I
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and wr ite i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of  each page you
should put the word MORE if  there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances us e a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
11) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. Ifyour program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork

selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are

that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it just as
much as a full blown six part series.

pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  complexity o f  program,

ment is generally between E10.00 and
£800.00.
161 A l l  payments are made in  the

18) I f  you want the program return-
ing to you, should we ﬁnd it unsuitable
for publication, then y o u  s hould
enclose a  stamped s elf addressed
envelope.

hen writing programs in Bask
is essential that you make them as easy
as you possibly can. This generally
means spacing your listings out, and
putting in lots of REM statements etc.
If you don't do this and you ﬁnd a bug
somewhere in your program, it's going
to take you a long time to locate the
error.
There are however a  couple o f
problems w i t h  w e l l  doc umented
programs. Firstly, the program will
take up a larger amount of memory
than necessary and, secondly, the
program will RUN a little slower.
The two utilities printed here, one
for the C64 and one for the Plus/4, will
solve these problems by crunching a
program down to its smallest possible
size.
What Happens?
The two utilities presented here can be
used t o  crunch y our  program. I n
effect, what the programs do, is to
search through a Basic program and
remove all the unnecessary spaces e.g.
PR I N T  " H I "  w o u l d  b e c o m e
PRINT"Hl". All REM statements are
also r emov ed s inc e t h e y  ar en't
necessary t o  t h e  r unning o f  the
program. Next, the program places as
many' instructions on one line as it can.
For example the program:
10 PRINT " H I "
20 PRINT "THERE"
would become:
0 PRINT"HI":PRINT"THERE"
P L U S / 4  A N D  C 64 P R O G R A M I I
- •
Speed up your prog
By
Once crunched the program is
renumbered. The renumber takes care
of any GOT0s. GOSUBS etc.
Once t h e  pr ogr am h a s  been
crunched in this way it will not only
take u p  f a r  less memory but w ill
generally RUN slightly faster than it
did in its original form.
Weird lines
It is worth pointing out that when you
list a program that has been crunched
some of  the lines will be far greater
than t h e  8 0  characters nor mally
allowed in  Commodore Basic. You
must never attempt to edit a line that
covers more than tw o screen lines
since the tex t fr om the thir d line
onwards will be lost forever. Should
you need to make changes make them
on y our original program and then
crunch it again.
Getting It In

There are two versions of the Cruncher
program, one for the C64 the other for
the Plus/4, I  will deal with entering
each program in turn.
C64 C:runcher
The program is presented here in the
form o f  a Basic loader. You should
enter t h i s  p r o g r a m  u s i n g  o u r
SYNTAX CHECKER program that
can be found on the LISTINGS page.
Once y o u  h a v e  enter ed t h e
program. SAVE it  t o  disk or  tape
before running. If you are using tape,
make sure that you have changed the

eight to a one where in icated in the
listing.
Once y o u  h a v e  S A  VEd t h i s
program out, you can then RUN it. If
you have made any errors they will be
indicated_ Correct the program as
necessary and RUN it again_
Once the program has ﬁnished it
will SAVE a new program out to tape
or disk called C64-CRUNCHER. This
is the program that you will use in
future. not the LOADER. Whenever
YOU want t o  use the cruncher vou
should LO AD  it into your computer
with:
LOAD "CM-CRUNCHER",8.I f o r
disk
or
LO AD "C64- CRUNCI ER". 1. 1 i f
using tape.
Once it has LOA Ded you should make
sure that the program to be crunched is
in memory  and then activate the
eruneher by typing:
SYS 49152
The amount o f  time taken t o
crunch a  program depends on how
large the Basic program is , s o be
prepared to wait a short while.
Once the program is crunched you
can SAVE the new Basic program to
tape or disk and use it as normal.
Plus/4 Cruneher
This version of the cruncher is a little
more complicated to enter than the
C64 version. There are two programs

ZONE RANGER
Games
Reviews
ven dustbin-men have got to go high-tech sometime. As
E
more and more satellites are launched, so space itself begins
to get cluttered. Throw in a few asteroids and life soon
becomes hazardous for those seeking to explore the ﬁnal
irontier.
So it is that you take up your new appointment as a Zone
Ranger. Working f o r  the Cosmic Garbage Clearance
Company, your new position is that o f  Orbital Debris
Destruction operative.
What this means in reality is that you whizz round space
blasting everything in sight for as long as possible without
crashing in to one of the multitude of hazards, These include
large lumps of rocks which split into two when you hit them
f ranember asteroids?) and the occasional satellite. There are
also some lethal beams to be dodged as well.
On the plus side, you can seek temporary refuge by
dricing into a warp hole, gain temporary immunity from a
sparkler or gain access to the Inner Sanctum where, if _you
can navigate through a series of passages avoiding bumpers
and sliding doors. help is at hand.

Zone Ranger is a reasonable shoot-em-up, especially at
the price but, written back in 1984, it is beginning to look

from. A  small asteroid, it was on a collision course with
Earth. A month ago, seven astronauts were launched with
the brief' to go and investigate. Five days ago, radio contact
was lost. All you have to do is Find them, give them some
extra fuel and restore the radio link.
As you leave your ship. you soon discover a lift that takes
you deep under the surface of the asteroid. Codes must be
gleaned to access various terminals and there are guards to
be avoided. Although the initial area appears small, there is a
huge warren of lifts and passages to be explored.
•[he display is divided up into three windows. Across the
top o f  the screen is a 3D-ish view of your surroundings,
bottom left is the information panel and bottom right the
control panel. This gives you access to a range of commands
such as picking up and examining objects, scanning the
surrounding area, re-loading your weapon and analysing the
character of anyone that you have just bumped off.
The game look s  very muc h lik e a  cross between

Also, all sense of action is lost everytime you access the

motionless while you decide what you want to do.
The instructions included with the game are deliberately
vague which is lair enough but there ought to be some escape
mechanism if yOU blunder into something that you can't yet

all the objects yvhen I logged on to a computer terminal by
entering the ﬂoor code. The computer then expected some
other input and refused to let me log off until I had entered it.

Hacker brings to your screen the joys and frustrations of
hacking without the summons. This game's more like the
real thing than its 'guide the robots sequel' Hacker H. The
game begins as you dial the wrong number and instead of
your usual bulletin board you get the message to log on. Log
on to what? You don't know the password or even the system
you've found but you're determined to ﬁnd out in an
adventure where you ﬁnd yourself delving deeper and deeper
Mi0 the unknown.
Your task in Mission Omega is to build a team of robots
to explore and plunder an alien spacecraft that's on a
collision course with Earth. Earth has programmed missiles
to destroy the craft leaving you only a few hours to explore
the ship.
Using icons you must build your robots from a selection
of bases, drive units, and balance the speed and attack and
defence capabilities to its speciﬁc job. They can then be
controlled manually or programmed to  follow deﬁned
routes. Inside the alien ship you'll ﬁnd critters to challenge
your battle robots and puzzles to bafﬂe your scouts in a
game that's a mixture of strategy, arcade and exploration.
Finally, Jonah Barrington's Squash is the pick of the
bunch and is a fast accurate simulation of the frantic sport.'
You can play either another joystick waggling human or
four different computer opponents in 3D graphics with
Jonah keeping the score thanks to some impressive speech

ARMY MOVES
Can you believe it? Ocean has released yet another
Commando type game, however this is miles better than
some versions of the game.
The plot for this game is far from original but, good plots
these days are few and far between. You are a member of the
SOC (Special Operations Core), a bunch of highly trained
tough guys who are ready for almost anything!
Locked in the enemies safe are some vital plans which, in
your hands could cause a big turning point in the conﬂict
between you and the bad guys.
Reaching the stage is no easy task, there are blown-up
bridges to navigate while avoiding the enemy jeeps and
buzzing helicopters that drop bombs.
Stage two puts you in the control of a deadly helicopter
and this time you must destroy the ground bases and enemy,
but it's so damned hard.
The next stage has you ﬂying over the sea where you are
constantly attacked by submarines. The fourth stage is set in
the jungle, here look-out posts will bombard any intruders
(you) but these can be destroyed with a well aimed bomb.
On completing the fourth stage you are given a code for
levels six and seven which can be loaded separately to save
playing levels one to four all over again.
Level 6 has you trapped in a huge swamp, and progress is
made by jumping on small islands. You are in the jungle

armed with a machine gun and grenades, huge birds swoop
sown at you, these cannot be killed. The only way to deal
with these is to frighten them off with gunﬁre. There are also
snipers which hide in (he bushes and lob grenades at you, all
this must be avoided while jumping from island to island.
Finally you reach the barracks, this is very hard indeed and it
will be a long time before I manage to reach the plans.
Overall Army Moves has a strong addictive pull to it.
with nice music and sound effects and some lovely graphics,
my only moan with it, is the toughness of the game, younger
players should check it out ﬁrst.

Why has Gremlin released yet another oriental beat ern-up.'
This is the third so far and this is starting to wear a bit thin
now.
OK so it is different from the rest but why can't software
houses come up with an original title once in a while?
Anyway enough of the moans and on with the review.
Deep in the Orient in the province of the Nang River,
exists a band of ﬁghting warriors. Highly skilled and deadly,
they are the roughest, toughest warriors since Bruce Lee.
On the River Nang is a temple known as the'Ghopemup
Temple' and this is where students are trained in Karate,
Kendo and Samurai sword ﬁghting. The training is so hard
that only the best student will be accepted and if he manages
to graduate he will have his name inscribed o n  the
'Chopemup Temple' wall.
You can choose a number of options including the style
you wish to ﬁght in e.g. Karate, Kendo etc and whether to
ﬁght until death or just have a practice run.
In a practice ﬁght you simply try out the various moves
available to you, but no points can be scored, In a real tight
you can choose your-defence and attack. You can also
choose your Opponents defence and attack points. The real
tights last a minute at the end of which you have a chance to
meditate to  get back your strength. The methods for

choosing your Opponent are the same in all the types of
ﬁghting.
After playing Samurai Trilogy for a while I was hooked,
the music is far out and really suits the game, the graphics are
very impressice and the gameplay is awe-inspiring, this game
really manages to capture the atmosphere which a lot of
Karate games do not achieve,
Another impressive thing about this game is the ﬂashy
presentation and the original oriental words such as Kata
(combination of step punches). This goes to show that some
software houses can take their time to research subjects on
which their games are based, not just rush the games out as
quick as they can or hype it to its teeth like a few houses I
could mention.
Well done Gremlin, more like this please!

hate insects! Not the ordinary spiders, bees and blue
bottles but the giant insects that have taken over the city!
Driving an Arachnus 4 armoured car that's armed with
partially tested bouncing bombs you must clear the insects
from the city's 25 regions.
The insects not only outnumber you but are also
organised Into colonies led by the queen that can produce
scouts and drones as quickly as you can kill them. The scouts
and drones are sent out to gather food and look for and
defend against intruders. The more food they gather the
faster the queen can replenish their losses.
To add to your troubles you're not supposed to damage
the city and so you have to be careful when you aim your
bouncing bombs since these carry on bouncing until they hit
something. They also bounce a lot slower than the insects
move so you have to anticipate where they're going to ﬂy.
Although the insects don't ﬁre back they can damage
your car with contact so it's best to keep your distance until
you can get your shot in. The Queen is harder to kill and is
only destroyed by a superbomb that you can get from your
base by radioing your superior. You can also order more
bouncing bombs and get your car repaired but you have to

any other game there are many things to avoid. For instance
if you run into a bottle of wine you will ﬁnd Monty in a

course be hazardous to your health if something is bearing
down on you.
You need to be a jack of all trades to help Monty succeed.
You may be required to ﬂog the Mona Lisa or even enter
yourself into a grand prix.
The one difference I found with this game from other
platform games is that once you've had enough o f one
country, as long as you have an air ticket and some money,
you can take of in a plane and take yourself elsewhere. Extra
points may be gained in ﬂight by ﬂying into the planes in

As you visit each country its national anthem is played.

MARIO BROS
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
55
Mario and Luigi are the famous Mario Brothers who clear
pests from pipes to make the money for the spaggetti (to be
read in an Italian accent).
Mario on his own, or with Luigi in a two player game
must clear the turtles, crabs and ﬂys from the pipes by
ﬂipping them over as they crawl along the game's platforms
in this conversion o f a three year old Nintendo coin-op
game. To kill the critters you must get under them and jump
up to bend the platform they're crawling along. This will ﬂip
them over leaving them vulnerable to a swift kick to ﬁnish
them off You have to be quick to deliver this ﬁnal blow as
they'll struggle to  right themselves and continue their
relentless march. You also have to be careful not to ﬂip them
again or they'll be back on the move again,
If you clear the screen then it's on to the next level packed
with more turtles, crabs and ﬂys as well as balls of ﬁre that
track your every move. All is not lost as you can also collect
bonus disks and even hit a POW plunger that ﬂips all the
nasties on the screen (even those already ﬂipped).
The action is mildly addictive particularly when Mario
and Luigi work together (although you wouldn't think it if
you heard the arguments about who's fault i t was).
Unfortunately, looks and plays like an old game that just
isn't worth a full price tag. Instead why not look at any of the
coin-op conversions featured elsewhere in this issue such as
Nemesis or Archanoid.

FUNGUS
Have you ever been decapitated by a lir tree or a bird? Well if
you don't fancy the idea don't offer to guide Fungus while he
goes hunting mushrooms inter-galacticallv. He'll get you
into all sorts of trouble.
Fungus is part of a two game pack from Players. If you
do take the challenge then you'll need to have your wits
about you as it is very fast moving. No sooner do you think
that you have made a safe landing and start eyeing up the
next batch of juicy mushrooms when you walk into another
tree, or even better over the top of a cliff.
The writer has introduced a new concept for growing
mushrooms, on islands ﬂoating about the galaxy, funny, I
always thought that they were stars. For some reasons the
mushrooms seem t o  grow very well i n  this strange
atmosphere surrounded by poisonous trees, lethal shrubs
and weird creatures.
The idea behind the game is to keep Fungus's craving for
Great White Mushrooms satisﬁed, and believe me that's not
easy.
As you leap along from one island to another there are
different hazards awaiting you. What makes the game even
more difﬁcult is that the islands are in three dimensions and
sit at an angle on the screen. This sometimes leads to the
impression that you are on the right path to avoid a tree
when you end up walking slap, bang into it.
However, even though Fungus is difﬁcult there is no
reason why you shouldn't enjoy it,it does have a certain "one
more go quality".
The second game in this two game pack is called Fruity.
This game calls for a bad case of 'watch/the birdie'. No I
don't mean grin like a cheshire cat I mean'watch the vulture
that is hovering above you.
Unfortunately this second game doesn't compare at all
well with the previous one. The aim is to collect fruit from
trees in an orchard and of course, like every other fruit picker
I've seen, you do this by leaping up and down ona
trampoline.
To make life a little harder you don't jump straight so
you have to move the trampoline around so that you always
land on it, otherwise, yes you've guessed it, you die.
I found Fruity extremely monotonous. The only variety
being the kind of fruit that you pick and the increase of speed
with each level.
Being a budget pack [would say that this collection was a

good one for the kids although they may ﬁnd it a little
difﬁcult. For expert game players I don't think that there's
much here to keep you occupied for long.
If you like simple but fast games then this may be for you.

To Buy or Not to Buy
Having read a great deal of articles on
the Amiga, 1 decided to purchase one.
Unlike many  readers. I  us e m y
computer purely' for pleasure, and saw
the Amiga as a natural progression
from my Commodore 64, which 1 like
to think I have mastered.
Anyway. just as I  was about to
place m y  order. I  r ead i n  y our
magazine about the new Amigas,and
particularly about t h e  new A500.
Consequently, I have a few questions
to ask. Firs tly , c an the A500 b e
expanded as  muc h as  the A1000?
Secondly, will all A1000- software run
on the A500? And ﬁnally, if the A500 is
so s imilar  i n  speciﬁcation t o  the
A1000, why is it so much cheaper?
Simon Weldon, County Down
Yes. yes and who knows? First/v. the
4500 is. with d u e  respect to the
powers that he a t Commodore, an
updated A1000 in a different box. It is
just as expandable. has all the sante
pitrts. and will run t h e  Name soﬁlvare•
The onlv hifferences there are relate to
the power supply and the motherboard
construction.
How Commodore can continue
marketing the A1000 I am not sum but
in .
without any quahns.

Agony
When you have ﬁnally saved up enough money and
bought your Amiga, you're bound to ﬁnd many aspects
of your new machine confusing. Here's where you can
come for help.
By George Duval
Play it Again, Sam
1 am a freelance musician interested in
using computers to further the state of
music in this country. At the college
where 1  lec tur e, ther e a r e  t w o
Commodore Amigas  used b y  t h e

tests. For the summer holidays I have
been able to organise the loan of one of
these machines and I was wondering if
vou knew of either a MIDI interface Or
some Sound Sampling software that is
currently available, and hopefully not
too expensive.

Taking You to Task
AmigaDOS

none of them more justiﬁed than this
Unfortunately.. then
can do about it, short of buying a lu
drive or swapping back to your AT.
One answer you might look at is the
new A2000, with an IRA! PC compat
board. Using some clever hardware
tricks, i t has been made possible ﬁr
users to partition the hard drive. with
sections for the PC, and sections for the
Amiga. This could provide the Meal
answer. although, paradoxically, it ly br
no means a cheap one.
Although the Amiga seems to be a veryl
good c omputer f o r  speciﬁc task
(excellent graphics, good stereo sound)
the aspect of the computer that should
really be causing a stir is surely its
multi-tasking abilities. What practical
advantages does multi-tasking really
bring?

Muhl-tasking is, in my view. the single
most important feature in the Amiga.
Users who play games o r produce
graphics probably 11•01( I even notice the
multi-tasking, it is only business users
who can really reap the true beneﬁts.
Although there i s  a  dearth o f
business software
A2000 ought to change that, and when it
does, a  new generation o f  software
ought to become available. all using
multi-tasking. In simple terms, multi-
tasking means that the computer can
split its processing tone between various
so-called tasks, A good example would
be that you could print out a document
from one word processor whilst writing
an article on a seperate word-processor.
Admittedly this slows the computer
down, but the speed reduction still leaves
the Amiga running faster than an IBM
PC!
Very few packages yet allow the user
to make the most of multi-tasking, one
exception to this is Scribble which, for
all its faults, allows the computer to
work at other things, communications
for example, while processing a ﬁle.
YOUR P R O B L E M S
Horsing Around
As a  gamesplayer whos e father
recently purchased an Amiga, I have
found the drought of decent software
is slowly but surely ending. However. I
still ﬁnd it surprising that some of the
games are of such poor quality. Why is
this? Why don't the programmers take
advantage of the 'Mittel'?
David Tweed, London
This is a very good question, but I n
afraid to say that the answer comes
down to money. As .
enough Amigas about, particularly
the UK, for many software houses to
justify writing games for the machine.
As well as this. most games that are
released tend to be conversions, U1MOSI
all of which are identical to the Atari ST
version. In many ways this defeats the
object of buying an Amiga, and I can
understand your annoyance.
On the other hand, there are some
excellent games starting to  appear.
Rainbird has added a great deal to
Star glider before releasing i t on the
Amiga, a n d  Psgnosis i s  about t o
release a host of quality 68000 products.
Bear with the machine, it will be worth it
in the end.
Printing by Numbers
It is all very well me having my Amiga,
and being able to produce incredible
pictures using Delux Paint 11, but how
can I get colour hard copy? I have tried
taking photographs but I continually
get thick black lines across the screen,
and I only have a Epson FX-80 printer.
Any adv ic e w o u ld  b e  gratefully
received.
Niall Stevens, Catford
Without wanting to turn this into a
photographic magazine, th i s  i s  a
frequently asked question, and there
have been quite a few differing answers.
Personally, I  .
take the shot the better. Use a tripod,
and open the aperture as far as possible.
Then set the speed to around one second
and shoot away. Generally these results
are good, although the screen does tend
to 'bend' at the corners.

equipment. Triangle is a production
company with a background in video
allowing supply o f  a  complete
package, including training in the art
of making a video.
Jigsaw
Triangle is combining the A500 in the
role o f  caption generator with a
professional video setup produced by
Onitron. The A500 supplied is a one
megabyte version (using the Alegra 512
RAM card). The combination has been
ch ristened Jigsaw.
Included in the price is software
such as Deluxe Paint 2, Deluxe Video
and JDK Images' Pro Video software.
Pro Video supplies a superb range of
oh screen fonts which are typed in and
laid ou't in a full screen editor. Font
and background co l o u rs a r e
selectable. When the 'pages' have been
completed, they can be strung together
using a variety of special effects and

The inclusion of the A500 helps
make the Jigsaw video system very
competitive. The package provides
everything you need to complete a
video including post production
editing and mixing. The hardware
includes camera, remote video tape
recorder, two video tape players, MSX
console and effects/caption generator

Training for Quality
The training support for purchasers of
Jigsaw consists o f up to four days
working with the system and a follow
up session at a later date (to "coerce"
companies t o  learn). Through
training, Triangle Television aims to
make sure that these systems result
only in imaginative, not "snoresville",
videos!
Current customers include other
production companies and colleges
which train students in television and

Amiga 1000 is the audio hardware, a
no compromise solution of digital to
analogue conversion producing stereo
sound, two 'tracks' per channel, four
in all. The A500 is set to revolutionise
the way we play our games. It's going
to be a case of "off with the Walkman
on with the Amiga headset".
The MOO and hi-ﬁ will have to live
together or some nifty 'tech trolleys'
purchased. Wo u l d  t h e  A m i g a
technology have been chosen for the
new generation of coin-op machines if
the sound hadn't come up to arcade
quality?
As well as pleasing the public, the
Amiga helps programmers because, as
with graphics, sound can be stored in
an 1FF format, a  standard format
interchangeable between software
packages a n d  sometimes even
computers. So a library of sounds can
be put to use in a number of different
ways.
Which brings us to the creation of
sounds. The audio hardware can be
programmed to automatically retrieve
sound data through four channels,
each assigned to an eight bit digital to
analogue convertor. That data can be
set up b y  the programmer (with
Basic SOUND a n d  ENVELOPE
commands for instance) or it can be
generated by sound sampling. This is
where the Futuresound product from
Applied Visions comes in.
Futuresound provides th e  fast
analogue to digital (outside world to
Amiga) conversion to compliment the
Amiga's D to A output. Futuresound

Anliga owners with musical leanings are on the look out
for packages to aid their electronic expressions.
Futuresound from Applied Visions has a lot to offer.
By Anne Owen
"digitises" sounds that it receives from
one or both of two inputs. The ﬁrst
input is the microphone, which is
supplied. The microphone is fairly
sensitive, registering th e  normally
inaudible purr of the Amiga 1000 fan.
The second input comes direct from a
sound producing device such as a radio
tape or video recorder, compact disk,
electronic keybord and so on. You just
plug th e  sound source i n to  the
auxilliary input o f the Fuluresound
unit. If both sound sources are plugged
in then a 'mix' will result.
The Futuresound box plugs into the
Amiga via the printer port, providing a
through connection for the printer,
which now plugs into the hauresound
unit. A red button on the front panel
indicates that Futuresound is active by
lighting u p . Pressing th e  button
switches over to the printer.
Software Studio
The futuresound software sets the
Amiga up as a sophisticated four track
digital tape recorder. Only one track
can be recorded at a time but. once
recorded, any combination of tracks
can be played back.
The all important recording level is
set by turning a knob on the front
panel of the unit. The recording level is
displayed on screen in much the same
way as you might see it registered on
the front panel of a tape deck. If the
ideal level is superceded then the visual
display jumps out of the box to alert
you. The ideal recording is at the
highest possible volume without
YOUR AMIGA july 1987

causing distortion or "clipping" — so
called because th e  o u t o f  range
frequency is clipped off and remains
unrecorded. Once recording has
started, the sound level display is
suspended.
Each "moment" o f the sound is
stored as an eight bit number between -
128 and +27. One sample is taken at a
time a n d  stored sequentially i n
memory. The rate of sampling is under
software control, defaulting to 10,000
but capable of up to 28,000 samples a
second. The faster the sampling rate
the higher the quality, the more
memory you use up and the shorter the
recording time. It is up to the sound
recordist to match the quality of the
sound with its potential use. A sample
rate of 7,500 is roughly equivalent to
the quality provided by the telephone.
I found that dialogue, either original
or pinched fro m ﬁlms o r  radio,
reproduced more effectively than
music.
The ta p e  recorder analogy
continues w i th  editing (where all
operations except for 'clear all tracks'
apply to the currently selected track)
and playback (where any combination
of tracks can be activated). There are
PLAY,STOP, Fa st Forward and
REWIND controls. The sound track is
now graphically represented i n  a
screeen window through which you
can pan sideways. This movement
through the track i s  achieved i n
window sized steps, with F F  and
REWIND, by clicking in the window
with the mouse, or a Byte at a time for
precise positioning.

Editing in ﬁne detail is catered for.
A box displays the value of the sample
at the cursor position. You may zoom
in on the centre of the graph window
and set start and end points within the
track. Playback and special effects
always apply themselves t o  th e
recording between the current start
and end points. These can be reset
from the TRACKS menu. Any part of
the recorded track can be 'zeroed' or
scaled up (louder) or down (softer).
H A R D W A R E  R E V I E W
Soft Sounds
The Futuresound software deals with
the boring bits, the ﬁle handling, with
reasonable efﬁciency. A data risk is
created automatically from the menu
by placing a 'soundﬁles' directory on
to it. As well as LOAD and SAVE.
RENAME a n d  ERASE are also
available on a menu so that AmigaDos
is avoided.

Each track has its own volume
control, a n  o n /o ff gadget and a
once/loop gadget. The latter is a
source o f continual inspiration. For
instance you can make short sharp
recordings o f  instruments on three
tracks for playing in a loop and one
long 'lead' recording on the fourth:
track I: loop "doo wop" chant
track 2: loop bass drum beat
track 3: loop snare drum beat
track 4: once lead vocal
A simple technique for capturing a
particular sound is to record for a few
seconds, set the start and end markers
around your chosen sound, allocate
some memory in another track and
copy the marked sound ot it. Instead of
copying to an empty (although with
memory allocated to it) track, you can
mix your ﬁrst sound into an existing
recording on the destination track.

are LEE formats, a  one shot' for
recordings that will be played back 'as

for short sounds which will be used as
musical notes. Futuresound works out
the other two octaves which you don't
have and, i f speciﬁed in the graph
window, will save a sound with two
parts, one o f  which becomes the
sustain element of the sound.
The latter format opens up the
possibility o f recording instruments

with C-ducer style microphones),

Meridian claims 1.25 man years work
on the software, so how successful has
the design proved to be?
Multi Useful
Zing! has the potential to be many
things to many Amiga users. It ﬁres on
twin carburettors, Firstly there's the
ability to move around directories and
tiles on an AmigaDOS disk, carrying
out DOS-like commands but without
typing command sequences. Secondly,
there are the utilities which 99% o f
Amiga users will ﬁnd very useful
indeed. I had personally been waiting
for just such a set of utilities ever since I
bought my Amiga.
Application packages f o r  th e
Amiga often shut out AmigaDOS. If
they are run from a CLI window then it
is possible to return to that window to
carry out a disk management before
re-engaging i n  wordprocessing o r
pagesetting etc. Zing! gets around the
problem in a much more direct way —
the hot keys. The left Amiga key plus
the function keys I to 10 are set up to,
in order, bring u p  a  ﬁle system
window, a new CU window, to save
the screen to  IFF ﬁles, to save the
screen to printer, to set the screen
dimmer time interval, to bring up the
disk copy window, the format disk
window, to set the Zing! defaults and
to bring up the Zing! hot key window.
The heart of Zing! is the ﬁle system
menu but the screen saver and disk
management windows are real boons.
The Zing! defaults are the abbreviated
commands assigned to the 10 function
keys used in the ﬁle system. In defaults

they can be changed to suit. You can
also turn on and off case sensitive and
advanced pattern matching — with
which the manual deals in a rather
obscure fashion. The task monitor is a
bit of a gimmick but it is fun to watch
the status information being updated
as a number of tasks perform before
your eyes.
Disk Filling with Frills
The ﬁle system window looks out on
your disk ﬁles and directories and is
packed with information. At the press
of a mouse button you can get the
current time and date (important when
you are date-stamping ﬁles), th e
system memory available, the ﬁles and
bytes in the directory on display and
which page of the display you are on.
You can click from page to page, size
the window and scroll within it. At the

copy, move, merge a n d  rename
functions with the same device gadgets
and directory tree available f o r
creating th e  relevant source a n d
destination pathnames. A s  w i th
AmigaDOS, comment tiles are not
copied with ﬁles. Messages appear at
all times to keep you up to date with
the current operation. A 'continue or
abort' message will appear i f  an
operation proves impossible (e.g. a
disk is write protected).
Sending ﬁles on to the printer is
just as much a  part o f  everyday
computing as sending them to  disk
drives. The problem is that printers are
slow devices and you have to  wait
around for them to ﬁnish. By selecting
ﬁles for printing and then calling up
the Zing! print spooler, you can set the
print operation going and then literally
place i t i n  the background behind
other operations you wish to carry out.
The ﬁles will patiently queue for the
printer's attentions without a n y
intervention from you.
The Zing! ﬁle system displays the
tiles as they are known to  it. It is
feasible that other operations may
change the status of ﬁles so the 'update
directory' option should be used to
ensure that Zing!'s information is right

up to date. The fast sorted tile display
is made possible b y  'zing' tiles,
containing a form of indexing. These
tiles are held on disk and you may wish
to inhibit their creation on particular
disks, a simple matter at the 'setting
defaults' window.
Zing go the Strings of my Heart!
Zing! means that you needn't leave go
of your beloved mouse although there
is some typing of ﬁlenames and there
are single key keyboard shortcuts and
hot keys. The print spooler and screen
dumps are invaluable as far as I am
concerned but the ﬁle system is what
you'll really buy Zing! for if you want
an alternative to the CLL. I wouldn't
call Cl.! 'mild mannered' as Meridian
do, rather 'ill-mannered', making its
master do all the work! Zing! takes
over when the CLI sits back, letting
you get more operations out of less
typing, more information in less time.
Although Zing! duplicates many
AmigaDOS commands, you probably
won't want to  dispense with C L I
entirely — after all there are always
R E V I E W
batch ﬁles to write. Zing! actually uses
some AmigaDOS commands so your
Workbench disk shouldn't be faraway
and i f you have a single drive system
then the Zing! command tiles will have
to be transferred into the c directory. A
good 'once-over' o f the manual —
which wasn't of the highest standard,
although w e  are told i t  will b e
reproduced on a laser printer — is all
that is needed since Zing! can be
learned as you go along. Crib cards
and d o c u m e n ta ti o n  b e co me
redundant in most respects.
Zing! can come hotfoot into a
wordprocessing session o r  a
spreadsheet o r into a programming
language when normally you would
have to go and ﬁnd your CU window,
if indded it proves possible to get back
at all without closing down what you
were doing. Zing! also comes to the
rescue if non-Workbench ﬁles abound
and you aren't about to learn all the
CL1 commands o ff by heart. In  a
perfect world Workbench would do all
this. Zing! takes a  more practical
approach and succeeds i n  making

Programmers cast their vote!
Right now, leading software developers
are hard at work on the next generation
of Amiga® products. To add the
spectacular sound effects we've all
come to expect from Amiga software,
they are overwhelmingly choosing one
sound recording package...
FutureSound. As one developer put it,
"FutureSound should be standard
equipment for the Amiga."
FutureSound the clear winner...
Why has FutureSound become the clear
choice for digital sound sampling on the
Amiga? The reason is obvious: a
hardware design that has left nothing
out. FutumSound includes two input
sources, each with its own ampliﬁer,
one for a microphone and one for direct
recording; input volume control; high
speed 8-bit parallel interface, complete
with an additional printer port; extra
ﬁlters that take care of everything from
background hiss to interference from
DISTRIBUTED IN THE UK BY:
"Open the pod bay doors, HAL..."
the monitor, and of course, a
microphone so that you can begin
recording immediately.
What about software?
FutureSound transforms your Amiga
into a powerful, multi-track recording
studio. Of course, this innovative
software package provides you with all
the basic recording features you expect.
But with FutweSound, this is just the
beginning. A  forty-page manual will
guide you through such features as
variable sampling rates, visual editing,
mixing, special effects generation, and
more. A  major software publisher is
soon to release a simulation with an
engine roar that will rattle your teeth.
This incredible reverberation effect was
designed with FutureSoundls software.
'
Question: What can a 300 pound
space creature do with these
sounds?
Answer: Anything he wants.
Since FutureSound is DT compatible
(actually three separate formats are
supported) your sounds can be used by
most Amiga sound applications. With
FutureSound and Deluxe Video
Construction Set from Electronic Arts,
your video creations can use the voice
of Mr. Spock, your mother-in-law, or a
disturbed super computer.
Programming support is also provided.
Whether you're a "C" programming
wiz or a Sunday afternoon BASIC
hacker, all the routines you need are on
the non-copy protected diskette.
Your Amiga dealer should have
FutureSound in stock. If not, just
give us a call and for E195.50 in
cash with order we'll send one right
out to you. Ahead warp factor one!

enhance a game and the Amiga has both. But does the
latest selection of games live up to this potential?

American cousins who are bravely prepared to ﬁght for
truth, freedom, apple pie, and the American Way. In S D I ,

This, it  must be said, should be easily accomplished
before lunch. It is simply a matter of preventing a group of
'KGB-led fanatics' fr om starting a  nuclear war. T he
redoubtable McCormick must destroy all K G B  attack

2000, by the Software Toolworks, is the outstanding offering
for the Amiga. There are two elements to the computer chess
game, the aesthetic and the practical. Chessmaster scores
hightly on both.
A beautifully presented game, Chessmaster almost
overkills on options. Choose two or  three dimensional
display, rotation of the board, board co-ordinates on or off,
voice. music, bell or silence. The pieces are ﬁnely drawn.
Swap between wood or metallic ﬁnish, deﬁne all colours

it, o r  isn't it? The A2000 is
supposed t o  be and the A500 is
supposed not to be. I'm talking o f
course about 'a business computer'.
Commodore, embarrassed b y  th e
combination o f graphics and sound
(games) and multitasking operating
system (business), have sorted out
their marketing by splitting the A1000
into two.
The A2000 now has Amiga and
IBM s l o ts  capable o f  taking,
respectively, business peripherals and
processors able t o  ru n  traditional
business software. We are yet to ﬁnd
out if this latter feature is just a get out
clause for those who never lost their
jobs by buying IBM. And does i t
matter anyway as long as i t sells
Amigas?
In the meantime those of us who
need no excuses have been getting to
know some of the excellent software
available for the Amiga ofﬁce. All of it
will run on the A500 as well as the
A1000 and A2000.
Workers Unite
Many computers have desktops. On
the Amiga you sit at a Workbench. The
Workbench has the available tools laid
out on it. If Analyse! spreadsheet is in
one disk drive and your disk titled
'Spreadsheet Data' is in the other then
two disk shapes (icons) with these titles
wil appear on screen.
To click on an icon you place the
mouse controlled pointer over it and
you press the left mouse button twice.
If you click on the Analyse! disk it will
open a  window a n d  display i ts

contents, the program itself, any
utilities associated with it and any data
neatly stored away in named 'drawers'.
Each item has its own icon picture so
you can't mistake its purpose. To
check the contents of drawers you click
on the appropriate icon. A  further
window will appear with its ﬁles and
perhaps more drawers to open and
inspect. A ﬁling cabinet by any other
name but no need to move from your
bench!

When you click on a  program

has its own pull-down menus, a place
to type your work and requesters to
ask you what you want to do next, the
name you wish to give your text tile
and the drawer to put it in when you
save it. Everyone, however little they
know about computers, will be able to
use a  package like Scribble within
minutes. Online 'help' ﬁles mean that
only the ﬁner points of use will have to
be looked up in the manual (which is
nevertheless extremely comprehen-
sive). The Plan series of software and
YOUR AMIGA july 1987
21
Grafox's Logistix both feature disk
based help ﬁles. So Amiga business
software presents a friendly face.
More Than Two Hands
The Amiga is capable of running more
than one such program at the same
time. With the 5I2K machine this is
more showing off than practical. More
useful and more lively, you will want to
run a menial task like backing up a
drawer o f  valuable ﬁles while
continuing with your spreadsheet or
database. If you are running Analyse!
or Organise! or Superbase, all you have
to do is reduce the size of the window
containing the program and click in
the Workbench screen which i s
revealed behind. You can create a
backup drawer by simply renaming an
empty drawer icon. Now click once on
your drawer (full of ﬁles) and, holding
down the left mouse button, drag it
over to the drawer named 'backup'. At
this point you let go of the left button.
Workbench now knows that you want
to copy one drawer into the other. You
can now return to your previous task,
resizing the window again as required.
Workbench is very easy to use but it
has i ts weaknesses. Suppose you
wanted to print a document or series of
documents. There is no printer icon on
the Workbench to which you could
move y o u r  document drawer.
Programs such as Scribble! will help
you out with printing tasks but some
are not so helpful and you may have to
learn some AmigaDos commands or
turn to a utility such as Zing! which
provides printing in the background.

Ofﬁce Soft
All the major business applications are
available for the Amiga. The new 2.00
version o f  Scribble! fro m Micro-
Systems Software is now a very good
wordprocessor and can shoulder the
hard work demanded of this essential
ofﬁce tool. The mail merge feature is
neatly implemented although more
information about how to interface it
with database tiles would be helpful.
The spelling checker, with a 30,000
word dictionary and a simple way to
*teach' the dictionary new words, is
fast enough to encourage its regular
use.
Scribble! also proves the real
usefulness of multitasking by allowing
the writer t o  have u p  t o  fo u r
documents open on screen at the same
time. The cut, copy and paste tools all
work across the documents so you can
combine t h e  h a rd  thought-out
wording of your sales brochure into
your latest mailshot by just copying it
over.
A range of paper handling and text
formatting commands can be inserted
into the text, variable strings inserted
automatically from speciﬁed disk ﬁles
or prompts generated for input from
the keyboard. These features are the
key to  the modern requirement o f
'personalising' correspondence. Now
all you need is a laser printer to do
justice to the different styles of text
that you can see on screen. Styles can
be changed a t  any time without
rekeying.
Still with Micro-systems Software,
the Analyse! spreadsheet makes
excellent use o f  the Amiga's user
interface. I  ﬁnd it very easy to both
enter data and manipulate the layout
using the mouse as a pointer. You can
insert and delete columns and rows
simply by making a selection with the
mouse. Labels can be set out over
multiple column widths for legibility.
Moving and copying is achieved by
wielding the mouse and paint roller
icon to highlight the data required and
pointing to where it should go. Dead
easy,
Keyboard " /  commands" and
pull-down menus provide access to the
functions. Analyse! features a large
array of functions, a macro language
for automating your work and a neat
set of graphs which are generated from
selected data sets. The graphs are
controlled from a pull-down menu in
Analyse! and do not require a separate
A M I G A  B U S I N E S S
utility. The business person will ﬁnd
the software easy to get used to and the
excellent manual will guide them into
the more powerful features. Its 200
pages, spiral bound, immacutely
typeset with example screens, glossary,
index and appendix o n  the latest
features. I t  reﬂects the all round
quality o f Analyse! and I  was most
impressed.
Superbase is the main contender in
the database stakes and we previewed
it in the ﬁrst Your Amiga. Its special
ability t o  handle external ﬁles
containing graphics is not the only
factor that sets it apart in quality from
other database software s o  f a r
encountered. There are a variety o f
ways provided to display your data as
well as sophisticated searching, sorting
and indexing functions.
Because it's the Amiga, it's worth
looking a t  business presentation
graphics. I f  yo u  w a n t t o  take
presentation graphics a step further
than the integrated graphs of Analyse!
then Aegis hnpact is designed for you.
It provides a whole range of graph
types to represent your data. Other
paint packages do have clip art to help
the creation o f  graph images but
hnpaci is purpose designed. Once the
images are created, you can 'program'
a slide show to display them.
There remains the problem o f
presenting the ﬁnished product. The
computer itself may not always be
available. The Polaroid Palette is an
expensive solution if 'one off graphics
are required. A  company that i s
already producing business graphics
on slide, from a client brief or from
'FT format supplied screens, i s
Phoenix (Tel: 0733 76896). Triangle
Television (01 874 3418) will even help
you produce a video if that's what is
required. A colour printer is expensive
for a one-off but a model such as the
Xerox gives remarkable results if hard
copy i s a  requirement. A  cheaper
alternative is the Okimate 20.
Communications
A quick word on electronic mail, now
a very real requirement of a business
computer. The Amiga can shine in this
department with a number of public
comain programs to give you a taste
and w i th  A-talk th e  outstanding
commercial program from America.
A-talk w i l l  combine w i th  t h e

22
Telecom Gold or One to One and will
help automate the process of dialling
and logging on. If you want to access
American electronic databases then A-
m& is ideal.
Data
Data integration remains one o f the
weak points of the Amiga compared to
some o f its (much more expensive)
rivals. As yet there is no 'clipboard' for
cutting and pasting data between
programs.
An interesting feature fo r  the
business user i s  th e  ability t o
incorporate d a t a  f r o m  I B M
compatible software. A  special
program can read the data and write it
back t o  a n  Amiga format disk.
Analyse! has a 'load Lotus 123' option
for such circumstances, It's  very
'round the houses' by this method. The
A2000 tackles the problem seriously
with its 8088 co-processor and offers
cut and paste between MSDOS and
A inigaDOS as they operate side by side
in separate screen windows.
One further problem which you
might encounter a s  a n  Ami g a
executive is the storage media, The
3.5" disks are robust but the Amiga
drives seem especially unforgiving.
Frequent backing u p  o f  data i s
essential. Note that both AmigaDOS
and Workbench rely on program code
stored on disk. A  single drive system
will require the frequent swapping of
disks. If you foresee large amounts of
data being handled by your business
application then look seriously at a
hard disk from the beginning. Like
GEM, Intuition is made for hard disk.

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SAW] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+2] means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPCA] o r, exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N , DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding

down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen i,vith no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
ISS].[C*]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic, Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine ke y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one of these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
:CC=2*[PIj*R:
Ignore the square brackets and Just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (le, the pi symbol).

mputer games as we know them began life in the
a e s  and since then the software houses have often taken
their leads from their coin-op cousins. It all started at an
easy pace with Pang providing the game that sold mat”
home game machines. Then came Space Thatch:Ts. Asteroids.
Breakout, Defrader and Pacman with conversions appearing
for all micros including the C64 as both computers andcoin-
ops discovered colour (the early coin-ops had black and
white screens with coloured strips stuck over them). Now
C64 owners can get their own copy of games like Nemesis.
Paperboy and Gauntlet and even video disk games such as
DraS O n's  L a i r !
Most coin-op conversions are surprisingly good when
you consider that the arcade machines have hardware and
graphic speciﬁcations that would put the Amiga to shame
such as a 68010 processor and about two megabytes of

busters such as  Commando. 1942. Ghosts and (lob/ins,
Romblack and, of course. Paperboy and Space Harrier,
Paperboy is one of my favourite coin-ops and my ﬁrst call
whenever I'm in an arcade. The unique gamepla y consists of
delivering copies of The Sun to subscribers while avoiding an
army of drunks, skate boarders, motorists, workmen and
animals that are determined to wreck your BMX bike. You
can tell the difference between subscriber's houses and the
others as your readers have bright clean houses whereas the
others are dark, cobweb ridden hovels and you even get
bonuses for  breaking windows by  hurling your papers
through them, I wonder how many other people practise on
the computer game so they can amaze them in the arcades.
Romblack was in fact a bigger hit on the C64 than it was
in the arcades and has prompted a sequel. Unfortunately,
Bomblack 11 restricts the leaping hero of the original to
straight left, right, up and down movements and the game to

The most spectacular coin-op conversions must surely be
Dragon's Lair and its sequel Escape from S'inge's Castle. How
could a humble C64 hope to mimic a video disc machine
capable of producing cartoon quality graphics? The result
was surprisingly accurate, helped by the simple gameplay in
which left and right joystick movements decided whether the

princess or got ﬁred.chomped. crunched or pummeled in the
attempt. Curiously. I found the sequel to contain the more
familiar screens including the perilous ride down the

chase down a tunnel with a giant boulder just behind you.

Inﬁnite Variety
Indoor Gaines (Advance) features a compilation of indoor
sports such as 10 pin bowling and darts and also air hockey,
a machine that lurks in the corner of most arcades. The
object of this amazing game is to guide a puck that hovers on
a cushion of air into your opponent's goal without smashing
your knuckles. Incredibly the computer version captures the

gameplay, the speed and smooth movement of the machine
but without the pain.
There are one or two computer games that have actually
managed to travel against the ﬂow out of the arcades and
have been converted into coin-op games! Broderbund's
Chop/liter was a hit on a variety of machines, including the
C64. before it moved into the arcades where it was revamped
and improved and is now almost unrecognisable thanks to
its superior graphics.
The coin-op version o f  Activision's Pitfa11! actually
consists of a mixture of Pitfall! and its sequel Pitfall 2 with
added erupting volcanoes, lightening and other graphic
effects,
Not many games make this transition as they have to be
good enough to encourage people to pay 20p for a game
(even though they might already have the computer version)
and be quick enough to pack as many games (and 20ps) as
possible into a day.
The coin-op conversions continue with three this month,
Nemesis. Express Raider and Gauntlet the Deeper Dungeons.
Nemesis
Nemesis. an Earthlike world is under all out attack from its
ancient enemies the bacterions. To save them you pilot the
prototype Warp Rattler space ﬁghter and duel to the death
with the bacterions.
Your objective is the bacterion superfortress but ﬁrst you
will have t o  battle past screens and screens o f  enemy
snakelike ships, gun towers, ﬁghters, exploding rocks, tailed
monsters and mother ships that have to be blasted four or
ﬁve times down their central shoot before they shower you in
The action is based around bizarre landscapes in which
deep space gives way  t o  built u p  ships, strange pipe
constructions, walls that must be blasted, platforms with
giant heads and bone structures complete with grabbing
skeletons.
As you reek revenge you'll be able to collect power
capsules that wipe out the nasties on the screen and others
that can be used to improve the Warp rattler. Collect enough
and you can increase the ship's speed (and avoid a lot of
trouble), equip the ship with air to surface missiles, double
the ﬁre power of the cannon, replace the cannon with a laser,
protect the rattler with a  shield and add u p  t o  two
sidewinders. These have the same ﬁrepower as the rattler
and form a tail behind your ship.
One of the best shoot 'em ups you're ever likely to play.

The wild west comes to your C64 in the conversion of the
Data East "get the train" coin-op.
Bouts o f  Kung-fu are punctuated by  gunﬁghts from
horseback as you battle to get to the front of the train. The
Kung-fu takes place on top of each carriage in which you
must punch and kick gun ﬁring guards, shovel wielding
stokers, assorted •cowboys and coyotes (?). The battle must

be won within a time limit otherwise a life is lost which
means the pressure is on particularly against one opponent
who hides behind a pile of boxes that must be punched and
kicked away before you can tackle him.
On horseback you must shoot seven passengers in each
carriage to advance to the next level. This isn't as easy as it
sounds as your intended victims hurl bullets and knives at
you,
Express Raider is  somewhat disappointing and has
nothing new to offer as it's little more than yet another
Kung-fu game. Isn't it time for something a little different?

17;auntiet — The Deeper Dur
When t he four  player roleplaying action o f  Gauntlet
appeared in the arcades the owners had to stop people
playing the game so they could go home at night. It was also
the ﬁrst machine to have a slot to take the pound coin as
players shovelled money in to keep their character alive.
The game was successfully converted for the C64 and
included all 512 levels. Now here's the sequel and another
512 levels for Merlin the wizard. Questor the elf, Thor the
warrior and Thyra the valkyrie to explore and plunder.
The deeper dungeons load in from the original game
(which you must have) and feature the same combination of
monsters, magic and mayhem in which the players must
light ghosts, goblins, deaths, lobbers and sorcerers to get to
treasure, potions and invisibility amulets.
Some of these new levels have been designed by Gauntlet
players as entries in a design a dungeon competition and are
particularly nasty. For example, one screen begins with a
duel with six deaths, another an assault by lobbers and all
have an unhealthy stock of poisoned food.
If you enjoyed the original Gauntlet (if not, why not?Ii
then you'll relish another 512 levels which could be training
for things to come as Gauntlett II is now in most arcades.

software utilities. Speedipen is a word-
processing package whilst Program-
mer's Utilities brings y o u  three
different ways to improve your own
programs.
Speedipen
As implied by its name, Speed/pen is a
word processor package. I t  was
originally available on disk but has
now been converted to cartridge. The
area of word processors is fraught with
difﬁculties since, in my experience, a
word processor iS a very personal item
about which one readily evolves
preferences and prejudices. I t  i s,
therefore, difﬁcult to review a word
processor objectively. At under E20,
S'peedipen is clearly in the budget area
and must be considered in that light.
The one virtue of cartridge based
software i s  t h a t  i t  b o o ts u p
automatically without bother o r
delays. Speedipen is in this category
and after a  mildly self-indulgent
opening display, an opening Help
screen appears.
On ﬁrst impression it seems that no
effort has been spared to make help
readily available so that you can
perform m o s t general functions
without constant recourse t o  the
manual.
Facilities
The big pain when using a VP on the
64 is the limitation o f 40 character
screen width. Software writers tend to
adopt one of two solutions:
1. Th e  edit screen uses 40 character
U T I L I T Y  S O F T W A R E
Programmers
Package
S'peedipen and Programmer's Utilities are two new
products from JCL Software. Do they come up to
scratch?
By Allen Webb
width but you can preview text in
its correct form before printing.
2. Th e  use of What You See Is What
You Ge t (WYSIWYG) format
with the screen acting as a window
on the document.
Speed/pen uses the latter option in a
fast and effective manner. My personal
preference is for the ﬁrst approach,
mainly because i t makes the check
reading of the document simple. It's
really a question of taste.
The author of Speed/pen seems to
have adopted a happy balance when it
comes to the features embodied in the
package. the usual options for text
format are available; justiﬁcation.
centering, tabs, word wrap.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
88
Markers which show where the
pages start and end are provided but
there are no options for adding footers
or headers. The usual options for
moving and deleting blocks of text and
word searching are also provided.
One welcome feature i s  th e
provision o f  a built i n Centronics
driver which allows the use of parallel
port printers without aggravation. My
main grouse is the repeated request for
information during data handling and
other options. Whilst I  applaud the
provision for drive numbers for those
with twin disks, a global hardware
option would reduce key pressing.
As a budget WP, this package has
most of the options I would expect. It

is both fast and efﬁcient without any
obvious bugs and I would recommend
it to anyone wanting to start handling
text in a serious manner.
Programmer's Utilities
To someone, such as  myself, w ho
enjoys hunting through public domain
and similar compilations of software,
the next item offered great attraction.
This i s  a  c ollec tion o f  t h r e e
programmer's utilities. I  should add
that these are deﬁnitely not public
domain.
There ar e three machine code
utilities, two toaid Basic programming
and o n e  t o  a i d  mac hine c o d e
programming. First we have an item
called Stepping Stones, T his  is  a
machine code monitor of sorts which
allows you to step through code so that
bugs can be identiﬁed. Traps based on
register values can be set and you can
identify subroutines which, since you
know they are bug free, can be skipped
at normal speed. Whilst this is useful, it
does lack features which would make it
more valuable. I would have liked the
options t o  disassemble code, read
U T I L I T Y  S O F T W A R E
tables o f  ASCII values and change
portions via a simple assembler. There
are a number of excellent products in
this ﬁeld offering, s tiff competition,
and o n  it s  ow n,  Stepping Stones
doesn't quite make it.
The next item is called Spritey. This
is an interrupt driven routine which
makes control of sprites trivial. When
your program is running, the routine
scans liv e integer arrays and acts
according to the values to position the
sprites, colour them etc. The sprite
designs are actually held within the
code and a rudimentary sprite designer
is provided. I t  does seem possible.
however, to access other designs by
directly changing the sprite pointers. I
loved the method o f  controlling the
sprites but disliked the sprite designer.
The adopted approach is to place
the machine c ode starting a t  t he
normal start of Basic and to raise Basic
above the code. This means that you
can easily integrate the code in your
program.
Finally, we have a snippet called
Baby Business Basic'. Those who wish
to write business software such as
databases will encounter the need to
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987
89
input a lot of data in an idiot-proof
manner. Where you have a formatted
screen, the code (in Basic) to input data
from the various ﬁelds used is large.
This item is a machine code bundle
which provides many such functions
via simple commands. The commands
include inputting from speciﬁc ﬁelds,
setting up ﬁelds, getting bomb-proof
inputs and ﬁle handling. The syntax of
the commands are generally simple
allowing y o u  t o  w r it e  inv olv ed
programs easily. I found this item to be
the best of the bunch and very handy.
Overall, I had one big complaint.
The instructions were supplied via a
large HELP program and commented
demos. I prefer an instruction booklet.
If you are in the middle o f  a large
program, the last thing you want is to
load a demo or other program and, by
use of' a pencil and paper, try to sort
things out. At E18, this package is also
a touch pricey.

As y o u  s h o u l d  k n o w ,  Y o u r
Commodore is always on the look out
for high quality programs to publish in
the magaz ine. H ow ev er , s o m e
programs that we think are excellent
may never appear in print due to their
enormous length. Ikrith Tech Draw 64
we are pleased to announce the birth of
Your Commodore Software. This is an
extension o f  our  Software Service
which w i l l  m a k e  h ig h - q u a lit y
programs available to our readers at a
reasonable price. And Tech Draw 64 is
the very ﬁrst program to be offered
through this service.
Tech draw 6 4  is  a  comprehensive
technical illustration aid, utilising the
high-resolution mode of the C64. The
program is either disk or cassette based
and permits output to a selection of
Commodore printers.
The program's ability to measure
line lengths a n d  angles allows
geometric shapes to be drawn quickly
and accurately. This together with
precise copy and rotation features
permits complex details t o  b e
constructed easily.
Once a drawing is completed i t
may b e  saved t o  dis k  o r  tape
(depending o n  t h e  version o f  the
program) f o r  future recovery and
update.
For users requiring colour, there
are a  number o f  options existing.
Photography of colourful drawings is
therefore possible.
In Use
The main menu of Tech Draw 64 offers
the following options:
create drawing;
return to drawing;
save drawing;
load drawing;
R E A D E R S  O F F E R
Tech draw 64

print drawing;
help (list functions).
The create drawing option takes the
user of the program to the drawing
screen. The main cursor appears in the
centre o f  t h e  s c r een a n d  i s
accompanied b y  t w o  edge cursors
which move along the horizontal and
vertical axes.
These ax es  a r e  graduated a t
intervals of eight pixels, so dividing the
hi-res screen into a grid corresponding
to the normal text screen. The axes and
edge cursors can be used to position a
drawing or to position drawings for
colouring.
At the top o f  the screen is the
prompt line; this is where you will be
prompted f o r  inputs, etc , b y  the
program. The right hand edge of the
prompt line contains a vector box_ This
is used to give the user information on
the length and angle of  parts of the
drawing in process.
Moving around
A joystick is used to move the cursor
around the screen. T w o  speeds of
movement are provided. Fast mode
allows you to move around the screen
quickly, while skit
position the cursor with accuracy.
Plotting a point
All operations within the program are
based around points. For example to
draw a line, two points are plotted and
the line command is used to join them
together. Plotting a point requires only
a single keypress; you will soon get the
YOUR COMMODORE July 1987

hang of deﬁning points for each of the
commands. So me  commands, e g
plotting an arc, require more than two
points to be plotted on the screen.
Since the point plotted is  quite
small, just a single pixel, you may quite
rightly t h in k  t h a t  positioning t he
cursor o n a  speciﬁc point is  quite
difﬁcult. This is where the auto-cursor
comes into play: This allows you to
deﬁne up to nine different points on
the screen and then jump the cursor
around them by simply pressing the
relevant key I to 9.
Functions available
Line dran — this requires two points to
be plotted, the two ends of the line.
Actitivating the line command gives
you the option of drawing or erasing
the line or. in case you make a mistake,
abandoning the operation;
Rays — the Line command draws a line
between two speciﬁed points. Rays is
similar but draws several lines from the
same original points:
Box — rectangles are a common feature
in any technical drawing. Box allows
I N
/ N .
A B S O RB E R
R E A D E R S  O F F E R
such shapes t o  be drawn without
having to resort to drawing each line
individually. A box is drawn from two
points which are to make up opposite
the corners of the box; the command
causes the box  t o  be drawn with
horizontal and vertical sides so as to
join the two points:
Circle — two points are required in
order t o  draw a  circle. One point
should be the centre of the circle and
the o t h e r  i s  a n y  p o in t  o n  t h e
circumference;
Arc — uses three points to produce an
arc rather than a complete circle. Two
versions of this command exists: either
you specify the radius of the circle and
the two ends of the arc; or you specify
the ends of the arc and one point in
between;
Ellipse -  as you would expect, this
draws an oval shape on the screen.
Two points  ar e required f o r  t h e
generation o f  an ellipse. One is the
highest point on the ellipse the second
the 3 O'clock position (the ellipse is
always drawn with its axis horizontal
or vertical);
Freehand — allows you to draw on the

screen freehand style Y o u  can either
draw or erase in freehand mode;
Fill — as its name suggests ﬁlls a closed
ﬁgure with the current ink colour;
'latch — in technical drawing a series of
parallel diagonal lines are used to show
a shaded area. The hatch option allows
you to alter the width between the lines
in a hatch operation;
Text — allows you to label and caption
any illus tr ations  t h a t  y o u  m a y
produce.
Block functions
A block function is one which allows
you to carry out speciﬁc operations on
a rectangular area of the screen. The
block is designed, as for a rectangle, by
plotting two points; you then select the
operation you want.
The f o llo w in g  operations a r e
available;
Wipe — this is used tO clear the deﬁned
block from the drawing;
Copy — this allows you to place a copy
of the speciﬁed block elsewhere on the
screen. Uses might include duplicating
shapes, such as electronic symbols. at

different areas on the screen. You can
place the originals for regularly used
symbols around the sides of the screen
leaving the centre free;
Move - this is similar to Copy, with the
difference that this operation moves
the speciﬁed area to a new point on the
screen, deleting the old area;
Rotate -  this function permits a block
to be rotated through any angle about
a deﬁned centre of rotation.

Even though Tech Draw 64 is mainly
designed w ith technical drawing in
mind, some users will want t o use
colour in their designs.
Tech Draw 64 allows you to specify

Once you're done
As previously mentioned, provision
exists t o  S A V E  y o u r  ﬁnis hed
masterpiece onto either tape or disk,
depending o n  t h e  version o f  the
program that y ou are using. T he
printer option allows you to reproduce
your drawing on either a Commodore
1526 printer, or an NIPS 801/803, or
compatible.
In the case of 801/803 you will have
the choice o f  either large or  small
print-out.
The 1526 printer option produces
small b u t  accurate copies o f  your
drawing. It is rather slow, since it has
to re-deﬁne the character to be printed
as the drawing is reproduced.
What to do
Tech Draw 64 is an extremely powerful
drawing package, especially suited to
users who need t o  produce acurate
drawings and technical illustrations.

Programmable
Function Keys
T
extremely useful for selecting options
within a  program and are easy to
detect. However, on many computers
it i s  possible t o  store strings o f
characters in memory so that when the
key is pressed a speciﬁed operation is
carried out. Even though the C64 has
function keys. for some silly reason
Commodore didn't Provide a simple
way for you to use them in this fashion.
This program will allow you to
store up to 30 characters, commands
etc. in memory so that C64 owners can
now have access to true programmable
keys. In  use function keys are an
invaluable and time saving tool. You
could for example deﬁne a key so that
a press of it will LIST your program, or
even LOAD a program off of disk or
tape. I n  fact the possibilities are.
endless.
Getting It In
The program is presented in the form
of a Basic loader and should present
you %Arith no difﬁculties when entering.
Do make sure that you have read the
LISTINGS page and are using the
Syntax Checker to aid your typing.
When the program has been entered
make sure that you SAVE it before you
RUN it. Once the program has been
RUN type NEW and then SYS 52224
to start the Function Key program.
In Use
The keys El to F6 can all be deﬁned as
function keys. You can store a string of
up to 30 characters in each key. When
you press the key the characters will be
reproduced as if you had them on the
keyboard_
C64 UTILITY
Have you ever wished that you could make more use of
the ,ﬂine tiOn keys on your C64? This utility could be
what you've been waiting for.

F7 is used to call the key deﬁne
routine and F8  is used to clear a
deﬁnition. When you press F7 or F8
you will be prompted for the key that
you wish to deﬁne or clear. When the
relevant key is pressed an asterix 'i" is
displayed to show that the press has
been registered. You should now type
in the text that you wish to be stored in
the key. Use the left arrow key to end a
deﬁnition and the combination of shift
and space to delete characters.
Any k e y  presses th a t would
produce a reverse graphic in a print
statement, CLR. HOME etc. will have
their symbol displayed as a left arrow
in the deﬁnition. Keys may be re-
deﬁned at any time by repeating the
deﬁnition procedure. Any keys that
have not been deﬁned or have been
cleared will be ignored whenever they
are pressed.
For those interested, the program
starts a t memory location SCCOO
(52224) and a buffer at WHO upwards
holds your deﬁnitions. The I RQ vector
at S0314/5 is altered to point to this
routine

nless you own one of those nifty
U
computer calculators, i t  can b e
annoying and troublesome to break
off writing a program to check the
result of a calculation. If you are using
Basic, then a direct mode statement
can often give you the answer. When
the calculation is lengthier, then a
short stand-alone routine can some-
times sufﬁce.
If you are writing machine code,
then additions, subtractions and
logical operations should have been
conﬁrmed before the code is entered at
the keyboard. The use of a monitor
such as the excellent ZOOM is to be
recommended. Logical operations can
be checked by a short routine, written
in a spare part of memory, ending in a
BR K instruction.
But you cannot beat the conveni-
ence of a fast calculator for such work.
The Program
CALC will give you this facility, at the
touch of a key. It is a handy, instant
result calculator that performs opera-
tions on real (ﬂoating point) numbers
and w i l l  a l so  handle computer
arithmetic. Additions, subtractions.
shifts, rotates, logical operations, can
all be done by pressing the relevant
command key.
When installed, the Fl key calls up
CALC, where the last result can be
seen and noted, o r printed on the
screen for use in your program.
CALC has two menus. Each menu
is a four-line "duck-shoot" menu at
CALC 64
For those annoying little sums that you can't do in y our
head, CALC 64 will speedily come to your aid.
the top of the screen. The information
that originally occupied those four
lines is saved to memory and restored
upon exit. The top two lines of each
menu contain the commands and the
third line displays the calculator total
so far. Line four is the guidance line
and i s a  fuller description o f  the
current command.
In Use
C64 P R OGR A M
When CALC is ﬁrst entered, the ﬁrst
menu is displayed with the command
ZERO highlighted. Use of the cursor
keys will take the highlighting to
further commands. The cursor keys
can be used in either direction, and
there is full wrap-round to both ends of
each menu. Pressing RETURN then
executes the selected command.
When the commands are familiar,
there is a quicker way to use CALC -
just press the initial letter o f  the
required command, a n d  t h a t
command will be executed immedi-
ately w i th o u t having t o  press
RETURN,
Commands
By T. Lansbury
When C AL C  i s ﬁrst entered the
following commands are available:
ZERO: Sets the ﬂoating point total to
zero.
PLACES: Sets the number of decimal
places displayed (range: 1-8).
ADD: Add number to total.
SUBIC: Subtract number from total.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987

MULTIPLY: Mu l ti p l y to ta l  b y
number.
DIVIDE: Divide total by number.
RESULT: Prints result to the screen
and exits CALC. The result is printed
at the cursor position when CALC was
entered, and the cursor is repositioned
on the line below the result.
INTEGER: A s  w i th  Basic's I N T

I f  you think that one of our programs looks very interesting, but you can't
afford the time to type it in then our software service will help you ow.
I
computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R.
U and N .  Yo u  press R E M  RN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how lo rig
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Conunodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of £6.00 for disk and O M  for cassette. None of the
documentation f o r  the programs is  supplied w ith the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INFONET LTD, Times House, 179 The Marlowes, Hemel
I lempstead, Herts. DPI I  BB.
TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Disk
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C I 6  and Plus /4
cassettes. However programs for these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
OLD
A M M
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
These programs are available on disk.
Please Note
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987

Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program, we do not put disk only programs
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

we've seen i n  the ofﬁce in  recent
months h a s  m a d e  a  v er y  g o o d
impression on us. Recently we've been
sent two new packages.
The ﬁrst is a C64/128 version of
COBOL, probably one o f  the most
useful p r o g r a m m in g  languages
invented. The second is a handy chart
package which will enable you to see a
graphic display of statistics or other
useful information.
COBOL 128/COBOL 64
For those of you who like to have an
easy life as far  as programming is
concerned, this package from Abacus
Software is a must.
COBOL is  the most widespread
commercial programming language in

from the US, in the past. Read on to see i f the two latest

By Paul Eves
use today. The reasons for its success
are many.
So what is  COBOL? The word
COBOL is the abbreviated form o f
Common Bus ines s  O r ie n t a t e d
Language. It is business orientated for
use in commercial programs. COBOL
is a language that is common to many
c omputer s . T h e r e f o r e ,  m o s t
computers equipped with a COBOL
system c an process a n y  C O BO L
p r o g r a m .  w i t h  o n l y  m i n o r
modiﬁcations.
The one single fact that makes this
a great language to use, as far as I am
concerned, is its English-like format.
There is no complicated coding to be
done. For example. to add two items
together y o u  s imply  s ay  A D D .
Another example is :  M U L T I P L Y

GIVING gross-wage.
Obviously. the major advantages
of such a  language l i e  w it h  the
commercial users more than the home
micro market. However. anybody who
likes t o  do accounting programs or
business software will surely ﬁnd it
advantageous.
Ingredients
Basically, COBOL programs are split
into four distinct sections, these are:
IDENTIFICATION division
ENVIRONMENT div is ion
DAT A d i v i s i o n
PROCEDURE. d i v i s i o n
The IDENTIFICATION division
identiﬁes the program. In addition to

required information, the programmer
may include such optional extras as the
date of the program, and the name of
the programmer. This division i s
completely machine dependent.
The ENVIRONMENT division
speciﬁes the equipment being used.
and some information about the ﬁles
that will be used.
The DATA division contains ﬁle
and record descriptions being
manipulated o r  created a n d  th e
individual logical records which
comprise these ﬁles.
The PROCEDURE division i s
what we can call the Program'. This
section contains the ENGLISH-LIKE
statements that go into making up the
program ﬂow.
Structure
Once you have mastered this breaking
down of the overall program into these
four sections, you are half way there.
Very brieﬂy, I  will demonstrate the
structure of the above divisions. This
structure must be adhered to in every
COBOL program.
In Example I  th e  following
example, all entries in capitals are
mandatory, Entries in square brackets
are optional.
C 64/128 R E V I E W S
There isn't enough room here to go
into the ins and outs as to how each
section is made up. Sufﬁce to say, that
once you have mastered this format,
then yo u  w i l l  have n o  trouble
developing your COBOL program-
ming skill.
Like a l l  high level languages,
COBOL is a structured language. At
this point. I must admit that in general
I do not like structure programming.
Half the fun of programming to me is
doing it as I go. however the accepted
norm is that structuring is good for
you.
I must also admit that I did have a
little knowledge of COBOL before I
tried th i s package fro m Abacus,
consequently I was able to understand
the manual with some ease. First time
users would probably need to read the
included manual two or even three
times before it all sank in.
In general the manual is well laid
out and informative. The software
comprises o f  an Editor, Compiler,
Interpreter and De-bugger.
The De-bugger is a very powerful
tool which allows you to produce bug-
free programs everytime. The De-
bugging takes place on the source ﬁle,
so there is no heavy machine language
knowledge required on the part of the

The second of the Abacus Software
products, distributed by Adamsoft, is
Chartpak 64/128. This i s  a  very
powerful package that enables you to
create professional charts and graphs,
without the headache of programing.
If you need to draw a quick pie,
bar, line or scatter graph/chart from
your own data, yo u  can d o  so
interactively. Chartpak instantly
draws it on the screen for you. You can
even take your data from Mu/lip/an or
Calcresult.
Chartpak also supports statistical
analysis features, data reduction,
exponential smoothing. least squares
and a host of other things.
On the C128, the resolution is three
times greater than on the C .  The
package also supports a large range of
different printer types.
Once again, the manual is both
comprehensive and fairly straight-
forward to follow. It takes you gently

The manual contains a  fe w
example charts/graphs fo r you to
experiment with.
The last chapter is devoted to the
more advanced Data-reduction
tutorial.
To be honest. I prefered the C64
version to the Cl28 version, mainly
because I think the screen layout is
better.
There are a total of nine types of
chart available. Pie chart, Horizontal
Bars, Horizontal 3D Bars, Horizontal
Graph, Vertical Bars, Vertical 3D
Bars, Vertical Graph, X-Y Plot and

the Commodore 64 are few and far
between. In particular, good databases
are not proliﬁc, mainly because the
difference between a  normal 'card-
.adex' t y pe database, a n d  a  f u l l
• relational' database is more signiﬁ-
cant than most people think.
If all you want is a database to store
names and addresses of friends, which
will only need to be called up occasion-
ally, then almost any simple record
!
create a  variety o f  ﬁelds, and then
create reports o n  t h e  similarties
and/or differences between them, then
a good relational database is essential.
This latest offering from Robtek,
the company responsible for one of the
ﬁrst good multi-purpose cartridges for
the Commodore 64, is  a  relational
database for the Commodore 64 and
• 128. Thankfully, the company has had
the good sense to slightly rewrite the
program for the 128 so that it takes
.dvantage of the 80 column mode.
Once you have loaded the program
:Or the ﬁrst time, you are presented
qith the ﬁrst of a series of menus, this
one being called the Job Menu. The
options available from this menu are:

SOFTWARE REVIEW
Filemaster
There are many databases available for Commodore
computers and the choice can sometimes be bewildering.
To help, tt:e've had a look at Robtek's Filetnaster.
By George Duval
9. Select another ﬁle
A. Quit
B. Disk routines
It is advised that ﬁrst time users
should automatically select option 3,
however, in use, a disk must ﬁrst be
prepared on which to save your tile.
Options 1 and 2 are self explanatory.
however option 3 is where the user
establishes what form the databse will
take, and therefore requires mor e
description.
Setting Up
You must ﬁrst name the six ﬁelds and,
once this  has been done, you can
choose the size o f  each ﬁeld -  in
characters -  and then the amount of
records y ou intend this databse t o
consist of. In the 128 version of File-
master, you have the added ability to
use numeric values, which can then be
calculated with.
The close index option is essential
to anyone creating a long database as
in effect it updates the ﬁle each time it
is used. If the computer then crashed,
you will then at least have created an
available index on the ﬂoppy. Search is
a very standard facility for databases,
and it is reasonably well implemented
in Filemoster, although it does tend to
be quite slow when working on long
tiles.
If. during use, you wish to change
disk, you must ﬁrst close the disk you
are working on, and then inform the
computer that you are about to change
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987

disks -  tiresome, but necessary. To
print any or all of your ﬁle, option 7 is
totally adequate, allowing f o r  the
printing o f  documents o r  labels.
Sorting, another essential part of data-
base is also included in Filemaster, and
the sorts seem both good and fast,
allowing any tile to be organised very
simply.
One neat inclusion is  the disk
routine option. It allows you to delete
ﬁles, reorganise a disk, format a disk,
reset your drive and rename a ﬁle. In
128 mode this option will also produce
a directory of your drive, and tell you
how much free space (in blocks) is
available.
Verdict
Overall, Filemaster is a good, though
by no means perfect, relational data-
base. It lacks any form of report gener-
ation and thus limits its use for serious
applications. What it does, it does well,
although the manual is  poor. and
therefore a few hours of trial and error
are necessary to make the most of any
database. N o r  i s  i t  exceptionally
cheap. Priced as it is at E29,99, anyone
considering purchasing this database
should ﬁrst check if  it is suitable for
your speciﬁc needs.

In order to animate a sprite all that you
are required to do is quickly change the
deﬁnition of the sprite on the screen to
a new one and so on until all of the
different animations  hav e been

Let's say that in your latest game
you wanted to animate a helicopter.

the one shown in Figure 1. There are
just two animations in our example so
all that we need to do is swap between
the t \S 0 sprites in order to make it look
as though the rotor is moving around.

The pmgr am " SPRIT E A N I M
LO AD" i s  a  Basic loader f o r  a
machine code program that will allow
you to achieve this type of animation
with ease. F or  those interested, the
machine code for this program is also
included for you to follow through.
Sprites that are to be used with the
animation _routine must be placed in
consecutive sprite positions. you can
use positions 128 to 200. If you don't
know about sprites then I suggest that
you take a look at your manual or refer
to the &etymon's Guide to Graphics
article that appeared in the April 1987
issue of Your Commodore.
Before y ou can use the routine
presented here y ou must have ﬁrst
loaded the IR() DATABASE program
that goes with this  series and was
published in the March 1987 issue of
Your Commodore.
The routine presented here allows
for eight different sprites t o  b e
animated on the screen at once. The
syntax for the SYS call to start the
animation of a sprite is:
SYS50480,No, 1st Sprite Pos,No o f
Ira mes,Speed
Where:
No is the sprite number, 0 to 7 are
allowed.
1st Sprite Pos is the position of the ﬁrst
sprite in memory. You can use sprite
positions 128 to 200.
No o f  frames i s  t h e  number  o f
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987

animations that you require.
Speed is the speed of the animations. I
is the fastest and 255 the slowest.
Procedure
1. M a k e  sure that the 111() database
is running. SYS 49152 turns this
on (don't forget to LOAD it ﬁrst).
2. T e l l  the I  RQ DAT ABASE that
you a r e  u s in g  t h e  SPR I T E
A N I M A T E  r o u t i n e  b y  t h e
following command:
POKE 838,1
3. St a r t  the Animation with the SYS
50480 c ommand a s  detailed
above.
To make things a little clearer I
have included the program SPRITE
ANIM DEMO. This simply displays a
series o f  sprites on the screen and
procedes t o  move a dot diagonally
across each sprite, This is not very
stunning but it does demonstrate the
way in which you can use the program.
Now that y ou can change vow'
sprite looks like, let's get it moving.
Movement
The routine presented here allows you
to move the speciﬁed sprite in either a
vertical or horizontal direction.
The Basic loader "SPRITE MOVE
LOAD" w i l l  plac e t h e  necessary

machine c ode i n  memory f o r  the
routine. Again I also list the machine
code program for those of you who
want to see how the program works or
use it from within machine code.
•Ille way we start a sprite moving is
with the command:
SYS 50180.1No,x,y.xhi.dir,speed,-
distance
Where:
No is the number o f  the sprite t o
move, 0 to 7.
X and Y are the x and y co-ordinate of
the sprite.
XHI should be either a zero or one. A
one is required if the sprite is over 255
pixels along t h e  hor iz ontal ax is
towards the right o f  the screen. See
your manual. for more details of this.
Direction is a number between 0 and 3
where:
0 is up the screen.
1 is left.
2 is down.
l is right.
Speed should be between I and 255. 1 is
the fastest and 255 the slowest.
Distance is the number of pixels across
which you want to move the sprite. For
example 0 will move the sprite 0 pixels
and 100 will move the sprite 100 pixels
across the screen

V
times in programs written by  those
who use Basic.
1 Iowey Cl, w h e n  i t  c omes  t o
debugging t he program. they  c an
prove a real headache, as you work
your way laboriously through a listing
trying to track down occUrenees of
each and every variable.
This Cross Reference program. has
been written w it h the purpose o f
making this task a whole lot easier.
Cross Reference works by scanning
your Basic program and producing a
variable n a m e  f o l l o w e d  b y  a
comprehensive list o f  lines in which
this particular variable occurs. You
can do this with all the variables yOU
have used and thus keep track of how
your program is structured.
Getting it In
In order to run the Cross Reference
program. enter the following (in direct
mode):
LOAD "your prog
Basic program to be listed)
POKE (PEEK(46)1 r  256,0
POKE 44,PLEK(46)-4-
LOAD -
name of the Cross Reference lister)

When the lister program is running:

asked " D o

you w ant output o n
2. It
printer. you will be asked: "What is
your program name?". Now enter the
name of the program to be listed, The
name will appear at the head of  the
printed listing.
3. Cross Reference will then begin to
scan the Basic program. It will indicate
its progress by displaying the current
line number being processed on the
screen.
4. When the scan is complete the Cross
Reference w ill be displayed o n the
screen. I f  printed output has been
requested then the printed listing will
be produced. II. however, a printed
output has not been requested, then.
each time the screen has tilled with
listing. its contents will be held and you
will be asked to press the H  key to
continue. When you hai e pressed El,
the next full screen will be displayed
and so on.
5. On very rare occasions. the Basic
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987

program may have too many variables
or too many references for the lister to
handle.
If there are too many variables
then, (luring step 3. the lister will
display the following message:
Dictionary full f o r  xxx (xxx is  the
variable name)
It
statement
NN•=60
in line 10. NN represents the number of
variables that the lister ,can process.
Change the a  I tie 60, to accommodate
the extra variables.
If there are too many references for
a partic ular variable t l i en. again
during step 3. the lister will display the
messa ge:
References full for xxx
If this  occurs then lo o k  f o r  the
statement
NR=100
in line 10. NR represents the number of
references that the lister can handle per
variable. Chan,ge the value 100. to
accommodate the extra references.

Operation
: Solicit option.
: Scan of Basic program text. Searches for names in each line.
Adds name and line number to dictionary by involving a
subroutine at line 200.
: Sorts dictionary entries into alphabetical order.
: Prints cross reference by scanning through dictionary.
: Adds a new entr t o  the dictionary. The name is added, if new.
along with the line number being scanned.
: Subroutine to check for full screen when displavinu cross
references.
Main Variables
: Array containing names of variables found in Basic program.
: A Mt containine, references for each variable contained in DRS.
Each reference is held as 'line no.-32768' to ensure that all
numbers from 0 to 65535 can be held.
: Array containing number of references per variable.
: Array containing DRS subscripts in alphabetical order.
: Current line number.
: Current byte being scanned.
: Address l i n k  ﬁeld to next Basic line.
lnidicates whether printer required -Y. or not -N.

T
Entry program has been written with
y01.1. the reader in mind. No longer will
it be a painstaking ordeal. typing in all

ensure a 100r; correct entry each and
every time you use it.
It has become apparent that a

problems using an earlier version of
this program. The program presented
here is an update of this version and
cures ally problems that we are aware
of.
For your own safety, do not use the
ﬁrst version of Hex Data Entry.
On ﬁrst entering Ihe Hex Data
Entry, only the LO AD  D AT A and
DATA ENTRY options are available
to you. This is because the buffer is
empty. and the other two options
require data to be present. On selecting
the L O A D  D A T A  option, you are
asked for TAPE or DISK_ Press either
•T' o r  * D '  t h e n RET URN. T h e
pr ogr am r e m e m b e r s  t h e  l a s t
Input/Output, and so it is possible to
just hit RETURN if the correct device
type is being displayed. You are then
required Co enter a ﬁlename.
If vou should make an error in your
ﬁlename entry. you mav either delete
single characters by the DEL. key, or
SHIFT/CLRHOME w ill delete the
whole ﬁlename. After the prompt. hit
return and the ﬁle will be loaded into
die buffer. The program will allow ﬁles
up to 95 blocks in length to be loaded

in. I f  you want larger programs to be
entered, you will have to split them
into two or more parts ﬁrst.
The SAVE option is identical to the
LOAD. except t h a t  i t  tak es t h e
contents of the buffer and saves them
out to the given start address. This will
save an executable ﬁle, that can be
loaded and run. independent o f  the
Input program.
Data Entry
The Data Entry option is the option by
which you can enter data from Your
Commodore, or  your own creations.
Once this option is selected you are
asked i f  you want to continue from
the given address. I f  you have just
'LOADed• a ﬁle, this address will be
the next available byte in the buffer.
(Allowing you to add more data to the
end of' the loaded ﬁle). Therefore if you
wish to contin Ile typing in at the last
address. typc •Y'. If 'N' is pressed the
program assumes you are starting a
fresh entry. When this happens the
butler is reset to zero, thus losing any
program currently in memory
chosen SC000 as the normal start up
address purely because most M / C
progs reside here). After pressing 'N
you are then asked for the starting
address, i n  I le x .  A n y  v alid H e x
number is acceptable. e.g. $400.SCO0,
$C0400. I n  this  example, the ﬁrst
ﬁgure. S400, would be interpreted as
$0400 by the program. Likewise $286
is taken to be $0286.
Once the start address is given, you
are asked if  you want checksums or
not. I f  you are typing in a program
from lour  Conunodore your response
will be 'Y'.
The screen display now changes to
show the current address being poked
into. Type any valid Ilex number and
the program automatically skips the
next byte without the need t o type
commas, spaces o r  returns. I f  you
make a mistake, one press of the DEL
key will erase the whole number. If in
the no checksum mode, when you get
to the end o f  the line, the line will
automatically scroll up ready for your
next input.
If in checksum mode, after eight
bytes are entered you must type the
two digit c hec k s = at the end of the
line. Unlik e the no checksum mode
you now press return to enter the line.
If the program ﬁnds  that the
checkson) does not match the line
entered. a warning tone will be sound.
YOU Will then be asked if you wish to
either: a) Re-enter the line or b) Re-
enter the checksum_
After' checking your line, i f  you
lind you have entered it wrongly. then
press 'L'. The line will be erased and
you then re-enter it correctly. If you
ﬁnd that you have only made a mistake
in typing in the checksum, then press
'C' and re-enter it. Should you wish to
stop entering data. simply press return

back to the main menu. Here you may
SAVE your program so as to restart
it not be r day, or you may wish to see a
printout.
On choosing the print Option. you
have a choice of hard copy or screen
eopy', The listing can be paused at any
lime by  pressing down and luAding
down a n y  k e y .  Pr e s s in g  t h e
REIN/STOP key and holding it down
will break out of  the print mode and
return you to the main menu.
The left arrow key 'top left of the
keyboard', acts as zero when typing in
your data. The space bar acts as the
return key when entering data. thus
leaving you free from searching for the
return key.
I hope that this program will help
to take the drudgerN out of typing in
lone, lists of data statements.

How It Works
ED on CP/M
E
and feared transient command in the
CP/M repertoire. Wi th o u t th i s
command there's very little you can do
in t h e  ﬁe l d  o f  direct C P / M
programming. ED is the text editor on
CP/M, and i s probably the most
awkward one ever invented, but it's
still necessary to learn how to use it.
ED was designed in 1973 and has
none of the user friendly attributes of
more modern systems.
ED is a context editor that deals with a
text memory buffer, an input ﬁle, and
an output tile. Chunks o f text are
passed from the input ﬁle, through the
buffer where they are acted upon, and
out to the output ﬁle. Occasionally,
you need never even see the text!
The facility for passing through a
few lines at a time is mainly a hang over
from earlier CP/M systems that had
little in the way of memory. ED on the
Cl28 can cope with as much as 48K in
the buffer area, any ﬁle that will not ﬁt
into this is beyond the scope of ED.
From here on, 1 shall assume that
you want to edit a pre-created ﬁle that
is shorter than 48K. The principal for
creating a new ﬁle is the same expect
that you start with an empty ﬁle.
To invoke ED you type its name
Followed by a valid point ﬁlename with
no wildeard characters. This can then
be followed b y  either the output
ﬁlename if it is to be different from the
input name — or a drive speciﬁcation
if the ﬁle is to be output on to a
different drive, other than the current
default drive, In any other case, the
output Filename will be the same as the
input ﬁlename and, at the end. the
original tile will be overwritten by the
new ﬁle.
If a separate output ﬁlename is
speciﬁed it must not already exist,
otherwise the El) will tell you to erase

it and drop you out to the new system.
If all goes well you will see the ED
prompt. If it is a new ﬁle, then ED will
also say 'New File' to remind you. The
ED prompt is:
Note the leading spaces, these
become signiﬁcant later.
One word of warning. Check that
you have plenty of space left on your
disk. If you don't ED will come up
with an error message and all will be
I ost.
In liorking order
Despite having speciﬁed a ﬁlename for
input, there is still nothing in the
computer for you to play with. You
have to load it in using the Append
command or A.
For our purposes, this comes in
two formats: nA where n lines are
appended into the buffer; or A  which
will load the entire tile into the buffer
and is the command you arc much
more likely to use.
Once the buffer is full of text you
can start to edit. ED works on the
concept of a character pointer or CP.
This is similar to the cursor except that
it works on the whole buffer, so you
can't actually see it. Most commands
deal w i th  moving th e  C P  o r
functioning in relation to the CP -
deleting from it. inserting at it etc.
nD.-nD: Delete n characters before (-
Di or after the CP (D).
Commands
Here, I will give a list of commands
which will come in useful when you are
working with CP/M.
nA, # A: Append n lines to buffer,
B,-B: Move CP to bottom (-B) or
beginning ( B) of buffer.
nC.-nC: Mo ve  C P  n  characters
YOUR COMMODORE july 1987

complex beast, but without
forward ( C )  o r  backwards (-C )
through buffer.
nD.-nD: Delete n characters before (-
Di or after the CP(D).
E: Exit ED. saving any changes into a
new ﬁle.
nFstring,  Z: Finds nth occurence of
character 'string', terminated with
CIL-Z. Omiting n  ﬁnds the ﬁrst
string.
I: Enters Insert mode. Esc or CTL-Z to
return to normal mode.
'string " Z: Inserts character 'string' at
CP, terminated by CIL-Z., If the i s
uppercase then all output is forced to
uppercase, Lowercase 'i ' leaves all
input as typed.
.1: Juxtapose, this is a rather complex
command and takes the form o f
'n.lsearch-string ,
occurence of the search-string or the
ﬁrst is omitted. It ﬁnds the search-
string, searches forwards to ﬁnd the
ﬁrst occurrence of the delete-to-string
and then replaces all intervening text
with the insert-string.
nK,-A: Deletes (Kills) n lines to and
from the CP. Functions in the same
way as D but on a line level,
ni„-nt.,OL: Moves the CP n  lines
forward (L ) or backwards(-L) through
the buffer. 01_ moves to the beginning
of the current line.
n.-n: Same function as 'L' but displays
the line.
:n: Moves to  absolute line n  and
displays it.
nNst ring Z :  Similar to 'F' except that
the search is extended to cover the
source tile on disk. It's much easier to
keep the whole ﬁle in memory and use
'I'', Command 'H needs to be used
after using this command to clear up
the mess.
0: Original tile. Abandons all changes
made in this session and restores the
original ﬁle. ED will usually ask for
conﬁrmation after this command has
been used.

number but has a special meaning.
Complex Commands
As w e ll a s  these s imple editing
commands there are a few complex
commands for tile manipulation.
11: Kills the old tile and re-enters ED
using the new ﬁle as the origin ﬁle.
niNI: T his  is  the macro command.
Command letters can follow the M
separated by Ctl-Zs where CRS would
normally ﬁt in. Sequence is executed n
times.
:n: This command is followed by either
the K. L.  or  T  commands and is a
'through-to' command working in an
absolute manner on those commands
rather than in the usual relative way.
Can be compounded with n: with some
interesting results.
Ude Z :  This command will read a
library tile into the top of the buffer,
Library ﬁles can he anything, though
ED assumes XSSSMS.LIB a s  a
default ﬁle name.
nW: Writes n lines from the buffer into
the new ﬁle.

common errors:
# :  Failed search. F. S. or N cannot
ﬁnd the speciﬁed string.
?c: Unrecognised command letter.

It Cost A Million
Ariolasoft h i t  problems w i t h  i t s
program They  Stole A Million' that
was due out at Christmas time but is
only just ready for release.
After a fortune had been spent on
the promotion of this product for the
Christmas market the accompanying
photo shows just where the Product
Manager Mark Easton ended up.
We are sure that you can come up
with some witty comment that Mark
Easton could possibly be saying. A
ﬁver goes to the person who we think
provides t h e  bes t c aption before
Friday 3Ist July.
Entries should be sent to: Your
Commodore, Cost a Million Caption
Competition, I  G o ld e n  Squar e,
London W IR 3AB.

Next Month
Have you sent in witty captions to our
recent competitions? Could you have
won a ﬁver? Next month we will be
printing what we consider to be the
best captions to the competitions run
over the last few months. You'll have
to wait until then to ﬁnd out.

append program such as an extended

the text.

A number of people have been in touch
praising the functions of the Analyser
program but are at a loss how to start
the program running. Unfortunately
the instructions on how to start the
program were missing from the text.

These programs have sold thousands of
copies, and yetyou won't have seen them
in the charts -- - why?
We produce programs that you can really
get y o u r te e th  in t o .  P ro g ra ms lik e

can be used at home or in the ofﬁce to do
all sorts of calculations, forecasts and
budgets_
Programs like MIKRO ASSEMBLER and
the ZOOM monitor which make it easy to
write machine code programs. Programs
like MUSIC MASTER which turn yo u r
computer into a musical instrument. And
programs like the BLITZ compiler which
makes ordinary BASIC programs ru n
much, much faster.
We h a ve  been writ in g  programs f o r
Commodore computers since 1978 and
now have hundreds of programs for the
PET, VIC 20, CBM 64, CBM 128, even the
C16 a n d  Plus/4. S o  w h y  aren't o u r
programs in the charts?
Because our programs aren't one minute
wonders, here today and gone tomorrow.
Programs we released for the 64 in 1983
are still selling — and even more impor-
tant, the people who bought them then
are still using them.
Software should be an investment, not
money down the drain. We believe that
the more you put into a program, the
more you should get out of it, and that's
the wa y i t  wo rks wit h  software fro m
SUPERSOFT.
The programs listed on the right represent
a small selection from our range, but you
can get a full list if you phone or write to
the address below. We offer an excellent
mail order service, and you can pay by
cheque, Access, or Visa.
