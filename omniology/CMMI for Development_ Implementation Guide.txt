CHAPTER 1
CMMI Overview
Many companies want to improve their processes, but they don’t know which process model to follow to 
make head way in process implementation. This is a real point of confusion for many in the IT industry, as 
these process models are seen as a hindrance to working efficiently, and too much process documentation 
might affect their productivity. Also, in today’s fast-paced world, customers put a lot of pressure on their 
contractors to deliver faster, but they don’t want this fast delivery to compromise the quality of the work.
So the question arises, “How can you guarantee your software product’s quality (whether it is a web 
site or any other software product/application)?” This becomes more complex when you have a large 
development team; and moreover, when you have teams which are distributed in different parts of the world 
or different cities in the same country. Without a defined process, communication with distributed teams 
can become complex.
Now, you might be wondering how CMMI is going to help? CMMI is very vast, and every practice 
mentioned in the model may not work for everyone, which may seem impractical to many during the first 
attempt at using it.
But we are jumping the gun a bit. What we really need to focus on initially is how we can mold CMMI to 
deliver the process and product results we require.
We need to ask ourselves a few questions here: What we are trying to improve? Is it a process, a product, 
or a team? Is it revenue, which is important for the company’s existence in the longer run? Implementing 
CMMI is an investment of time and money, but this investment will certainly provide ROI to the company in 
a positive way.
And again, there are more questions: Who are the first people in your organization who will think or 
analyze whether CMMI is important for them and the organization? And how will these people implement 
CMMI step-by-step, so that the organization can head forward in the CMMI way?
Well, your senior-management professionals in the organization have to jump in and understand the 
real value of CMMI best practices before they force or tell the delivery teams to become process oriented in 
everything they do.
You might wonder here, “Why senior management?” Well, why not? They are the people who make 
most of the decisions in the organization, mostly for the good of the organization. It is their job to make it is 
easier for the delivery team to produce the required products and results.
The top-down approach works well the most organizations. If senior management agrees to something, 
it can assure that a directive is followed by everyone else. Otherwise, teams which are at the lower level will 
feel reluctant in following the process-oriented approach because they will see it as an overhead, which is 
the wrong notion.
And why it is a wrong notion? Because every step or action we take in our project or product 
development is a process itself, though we don’t always realize this. For example, writing the code for a 
module and conducting unit tests are also part of a process.
CMMI talks about all the different process areas which a process-oriented organization should define 
and follow. What are all these process areas? In this book, we’ll walk you through these different process 
areas, to give you a better understanding of CMMI.

Chapter 1 ■ CMMI Overview
2
In this chapter, we will provide an overview of CMMI, describe its evolution, and then cover where it 
can be used and by whom.
Before moving to CMMI, let’s cover what a process is. A process can be defined as a set of inter-related 
activities which take some input, and then generate output with a given purpose. Generally, a process 
involves tools and methods.
Put more simply, you can define process as a series of actions or steps taken to achieve a particular goal. 
A typical process is:
• 
Simple
• 
Well documented
• 
Measurable
• 
Flexible
• 
Stable
Process is important because the quality of the product depends a lot on the quality of the processes 
that we use to create it. It is for this reason that CMMI has been developed with
Hence, the quality of the process is very crucial to the quality of the end product. CMMI has been 
developed with a strong emphasis on the relationship between process and product quality.
1.1  What Is CMMI?
CMMI is about collecting the characteristics of effective processes, and then using this information to 
provide guidance for improving an organization’s processes. The end goal is to make it easier for an 
organization to develop products or solutions by improving its ability to manage the development, 
acquisition, and maintenance of its products or services.
CMMI is a model; it tells us what to do, but not how to do it. It is not a set of practices and methodology 
but it is the concept that we need to apply to the organization to get mature from a process perspective.
The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a capability improvement model 
that can be adapted to solve any performance issue at any level of the organization 
in any industry. The Model provides guidelines and recommendations for helping 
your organization diagnose problems and improve performance. Used by over 5000 
organizations in more than 70 countries all over the world, CMMI helps you identify and 
achieve measurable business goals.
— CMMI Institute
1.1.1  A CMMI Overview
CMMI was developed by a group of expert professionals from industry, government, and the Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI) at CMU. A CMMI model is set of guidance, and it can be used as a framework 
for appraising the process maturity of an organization. CMMI currently addresses three important area of 
interest:
• 
Product and service development—CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV)
• 
Service establishment, management—CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC)
• 
Product and service acquisition—CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ).

Chapter 1 ■ CMMI Overview
3
The first two areas of interest are widely used and in high demand. In this book, we will be covering the 
first area, product and service development, which is also popularly known as CMMI-DEV.
CMMI-DEV v1.3 is a reference model that covers activities for developing both products and services. 
These days, many organizations from various industries (e.g., software, defense, aerospace, banking, 
automobile, manufacturing, and telecommunications) implement and follow CMMI-DEV v1.3 industry best 
practices.
CMMI-DEV contains practices for process areas (i.e., project management, process management, 
systems engineering, hardware engineering, software engineering, and support) which are implemented in 
both development and maintenance projects.
As professionals, we need to use our own judgment and common sense to interpret the model for our 
organization. The process areas described in this model depict behaviors considered as best practices for 
most of the users.
Process areas and practices should be interpreted using an in-depth knowledge of CMMI-DEV, your 
organizational constraints, and your business environment.
1.1.2  Business Objectives in CMMI
Understanding the business objective is very important for every organization, and it plays a key role in 
enhancing an organization’s continued existence. It can also improve its profitability and market share. 
Business objective can influence an organization's success; hence, organization objectives should be 
developed by senior management only. Some of the business objectives from CMMI-DEV include the 
following:
• 
Deliver products within budget and on time
• 
Improve productivity by a specified percent in a specified timeframe
• 
Maintain customer satisfaction ratings
• 
Improve time-to-market for new products or service releases by a specified percent 
in a specified timeframe
• 
Reduce the rate of product recalls by a specified percent in a specified timeframe
• 
Decrease the cost of maintaining legacy products by a specified percent in a 
specified timeframe
■
■Note   To make the business objective more successful, pinpoint those areas that are most critical to the 
success of the organization.
CMMI talks about defining the organizational business objectives. There are several Specific Practices 
(SPs) where business objectives provide the principle context for interpreting and applying the practice. At 
all maturity levels, we have process areas that contain these practices. Business objective general practices 
(GPs) and SPs will be elaborated on at much greater length later in this book.
1.2  The Evolution of CMMI
Before you know when it was originated, shouldn’t you know why it was originated? When the need for 
something becomes imperative, you are forced to find ways of getting or achieving it.
"Necessity is the mother of invention."

Chapter 1 ■ CMMI Overview
4
CMMI was originated by SEI (Software Engineering Institute) and sponsored by the US DOD 
(Department of Defense). The project consisted of members of industry, government, and Carnegie Mellon 
SEI. In the early 1980’s, many US military projects involving software subcontractors were lagging behind the 
schedule.
Subcontractors were scattered both across the US and outside the US, and every organization had its 
own set of process guidelines to do the same work. Hence, it was difficult for DOD and NDIA (National 
Defense Industrial Association) to merge the output from multiple projects or from various vendors. A new 
working model was required which would enable every organization to follow the same path for building a 
new product or solution.
Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was developed based on the study and data collected from various 
organizations who had worked as a vendor with the U.S Department of Defense. In CMM, the term maturity 
refers to improving your processes on a continual basis.
At the request of the U.S. Air Force (USAF), Humphrey and SEI together created the process maturity 
framework to help the U.S. DOD to evaluate the software development process capability of their vendors, as 
part of the process of awarding them work contracts.
The full representation of Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was developed in 1991 and updated in 
1993 as version 1.1.
In 2000, the CMMI team published the original CMMI Model for its training and appraisal method, 
which incorporated software and systems engineering. The design includes full support for the future 
integration of other disciplines.
The current version of the CMMI model at the time of writing is CMMI V1.3, which was released in 
2010. Figure 1-1 visually represents the evolution of CMMI.

1.2.1  Why Use CMMI?
Here is an obvious question if you are new to CMMI: why should you use it? There are many reasons to 
choose CMMI, but and one of the most important is performance. The main purpose of CMMI is to improve 
the existing performance of organizational standards, processes, and procedures.
CMMI is also very helpful for the organizations that want to improve their capability to consistently 
and predictably deliver the products, services, and goods that its customers want. Hence, it also helps 
organizations to achieve its performance goals.
1.2.1.1  CMMI Is Used for Process Improvement
To cater to comprehensive business process improvements, CMMI features 25 different process areas. Each 
process area is composed of two kinds of goals (generic goal and specific goal) and two kinds of practices. 
There is also a lot of information for helping management to develop strategies.
In CMMI, there are three constellations to help improve a given business need, which are listed as 
follows:
• 
Development: For improving the development of solutions
• 
Acquisition: For improving the purchasing of products, services, and/or solutions
• 
Services: For improving the delivery of services and the creation of service systems 
to operate a solution
As mentioned previously, CMMI was written by a group of industry experts professionals. 
Consequently, the CMMI model comprises a set of industry best practices. IT organizations and industries 
use the CMMI model as a benchmark to improve their processes.
1.2.1.2  CMMI Is Used for Appraisals
Organizations also use CMMI to appraise the entire organization or just one business unit present at one or 
more locations. Appraisal is done using the best practices defined in the model.
This book covers both how to perform appraisal activities within your organization and how to 
determine who should be involved in the appraisal process.
1.3  Where CMMI Can Be Used?
CMMI can be used by any organization, small or large, that wants to improve its capabilities and performance. 
These days, CMMI is used across the organization and in fields as diverse as aviation and aerospace, computer 
networking, computer software, information technology, defense and space, hospital and healthcare, 
government administration, insurance, management consulting, outsourcing, and much more.
CMMI is also used by many commercial and government organizations to assist in defining the process 
improvements for system engineering, software engineering, and product and process development.
Many organizations use these processes to develop, acquire, and maintain products and services, as 
well as to benchmark themselves against other organizations. Better processes will lead to less rework, 
which reduces the overall cost and improves the quality of the product.
1.4  Who Can Use CMMI?
Many in the IT industry do not know whether they have a role to play in CMMI implementation. And if they 
do have a role to play, how do they initiate it?

Chapter 1 ■ CMMI Overview
6
Let’s begin by looking at all the people who might be involved. This includes the CEO, the CTO, vice 
presidents, business unit heads, program managers, project managers, quality managers, team/tech leads, 
business analysts, system architects, designers, developers, testers, SQAs, configuration controllers, and 
training departments.
If you are connected to any of the aforementioned categories, then you are pretty much involved in 
the implementation of CMMI. In the future, there might be many more roles created with a connection to 
CMMI. But here’s a more concise way to state who has a stake in CMMI: anybody who is involved in the 
planning and execution of an IT project—whether from engineering, project management, or support and 
process perspective—is involved in implementing CMMI practices.
1.4.1  CMMI Is Adopted Worldwide
Results published by CMMI Institute show that more than 1,900 appraisals in 61 countries were conducted 
in 2015, making it the fourth consecutive year for a record number of appraisals. The rate of growth has 
increased year over year, reaching 17% more appraisals in 2015 than in 2014 (see Figure 1-2).
CMMI is being adopted worldwide, including North America, Europe, India, Australia, Asia Pacific, and 
the Far East. CMMI is used by world’s most admired organizations, including Samsung, Accenture, Proctor & 
Gamble, and Siemens.
This kind of response has substantiated the SEI’s commitment to the CMMI models and SCAMPI. 
CMMI adoption has been a powerful differentiator for businesses and organizations, as well as a catalyst for 
economic growth for those who invest in its broad adoption.
"To compete in the global market, leaders must build organizations that can consistently 
deliver quality and value in products and services.”

1.6  Summary
I hope that you now have an appreciation for the theoretical foundation for CMMI-DEV. In this chapter, we 
have discussed CMMI, both providing an overview and briefly reflecting on the business objective. We also 
covered the history of CMMI, why to use it, where it can be used, and who can use it.
In the next chapter, we will discuss about the design of CMMI, the levels within CMMI, and what they 
mean. We will also discuss process areas in CMMI, including they are mapped to each other.

CHAPTER 2
CMMI Design
In this chapter, we will focus on CMMI design, including how the CMMI Dev model is structured, how to 
interpret it, and why it is important to understand the design of CMMI.
The first question that comes to mind is, “Why it is important to understand CMMI design?”
To implement this model in your organization or projects, you need to follow a specific path which 
leads to the end goal. Once the path is understood, it becomes easy to interpret and execute.
Time is always an important factor and something we all want to save, so the next question that comes 
to mind is, “How easily can we understand and adapt this model?”
Let’s start by breaking down the design of the CMMI DEV Model. What does CMMI stands for? And 
what is Development or DEV?
CMMI stands for Capability Maturity Model Integration:
• 
Capability: When we want to implement and achieve a process improvement in an 
individual process area.
• 
Maturity: When we want to implement and achieve process improvement in a set of 
process areas which are predefined.
• 
Model: Generated from the CMMI Framework.
• 
Integration: This approach uses a combination of selected models (e.g., CMMI 
for software, systems engineering, and integrated product development) that are 
integrated into the single framework, CMM-I. The “I” stands for integration. (The 
first model developed was CMMI for development).
2.1  CMMI Levels
In CMMI, each level describes the maturity of the process. Each maturity level consists of process areas 
(which are already defined), and these levels are achieved in a progressive manner.
Capability and maturity are associated with capability levels and maturity levels, respectively.
Both types of levels describe improvement paths to initiate CMMI implementation. So, how do we 
describe capability levels?
2.1.1  Capability Levels
A capability level is a path which ensures that an organization will improve an individual process area 
or a group of process areas incrementally. Focusing on the particulars of a given process will help an 
organization improve its capability level in that process area.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
10
There are four capability levels:
• 
Level 0: Incomplete
• 
Level 1: Performed
• 
Level 2: Managed
• 
Level 3: Defined
Figure 2-1.  Showing capability level continuous representation
Let’s interpret each capability level, one-by-one.
2.1.1.1  Capability Level 0: Incomplete
Incomplete means that specific goals are not satisfied for the process area. Also, generic goals do not exist for 
this level.
2.1.1.2  Capability Level 1: Performed
Performed means that needed work is accomplished and that specific goals of the process area are satisfied. 
At capability level 1, process improvements need to be institutionalized and maintained, or they may be lost 
completely over a period of time.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
11
2.1.1.3  Capability Level 2: Managed
Managed means that your process has been planned and executed, as defined by your organization:
• 
Includes a team of skilled people
• 
Produces outputs in a controlled manner
• 
Involves the stakeholders
• 
Your process is monitored, controlled, and reviewed
• 
Includes an evaluation of your process description for process adherence
Process adherence at capability level 2 ensures that your organization retains existing practices during 
crucial times.
2.1.1.4  Capability Level 3: Defined
Defined means that tailoring of processes from your defined processes is done in the organization by 
adhering to its tailoring guidelines. (You will learn about tailoring later in the book.)
At capability level 3, organizations also contribute experiences to the organizational process assets that 
are gained during the implementation of processes.
You might wonder how you distinguish between capability levels 2 and 3. Let’s look at the 
distinguishing factors:
At capability level 2, either the complete process or some of its descriptions 
differ from one project to another. In other words, processes are not common 
throughout the organization.
At capability level 3, standard processes are common throughout the 
organization. Processes are allowed to be tailored for a project or the 
organizational unit. Tailoring is done by following the defined tailoring 
guidelines for the organization.
At level 3, processes are written in a rigorous manner and are managed proactively. Processes are 
considered more consistent, and the only noticeable differences are allowed by the tailoring guidelines.
Once an organization achieves capability level 3 in the process areas that were considered for 
improvement, it can move ahead further on its process improvement path by focusing on implementing the 
high maturity process areas (i.e., Organizational Process Performance, Quantitative Project Management, 
Causal Analysis and Resolution, and Organizational Performance Management).
■
■Note   Once an organization fulfills capability level 3 in process areas (i.e., OPP and QPM), then it should 
plan to move ahead and implement process areas CAR and OPM.
So far we have discussed the capability levels; now, let’s look at the maturity levels.
2.1.2  Maturity Levels
A maturity level is a path that ensures organizations are able to improve their successive sets of process areas 
in an incremental manner. Each maturity level has a set of processes which, if implemented together, will 
help you to attain one full maturity level (e.g., to go from level 1 to level 2).

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
12
The five maturity levels progress from level 1 to level 5 in incremental stages (see Figure 2-2):
• 
Level 1: Initial
• 
Level 2: Managed
• 
Level 3: Defined
• 
Level 4: Quantitatively managed
• 
Level 5: Optimizing
Figure 2-2.  Showing CMMI staged representations
Let’s interpret each maturity level.
2.1.2.1  Maturity Level 1: Initial
Initial means the processes are ad hoc. Success is dependent on the capability of a few people in the 
organization who are seen as heroes and not based on the available processes; in the future, when these few 
heroic people leave the organization, the team is unable to repeat the success.
In a maturity level 1 organization, the products built and services provided work well most of the time; 
however, the budget and schedule always get impacted and deviate from their documented plans.
Also, it has been observed that level 1 teams overcommit to their clients/customers. This is because, at 
times of crisis (e.g., an event that impacts the schedule), the whole team abandons the process in order to 
deliver faster. Due to this, they are unable to repeat the success.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
13
2.1.2.2  Maturity Level 2: Managed
Managed means that projects are adhering to organization-defined processes. Team/resources working on 
the project possess the right skill levels to produce controlled outputs:
• 
Projects and their work products are monitored, controlled, and reviewed
• 
Projects and their work products are evaluated for adherence to their process 
descriptions
• 
Management is aware of the status of the work products at defined intervals (e.g., at 
major milestones and at the completion of major tasks)
• 
Commitments among relevant stakeholders are visible
■
■Note   At maturity level 2, process discipline helps in ensuring the retention of existing practices during 
times of stress in the project. By following the process, projects are performed and managed as per the 
documented plans.
2.1.2.3  Maturity Level 3: Defined
Defined means that processes are well defined, documented, understood, and followed by various means 
(e.g., whether through procedures, methods or tools). Processes followed on a day-to-day basis are further 
improved over time at the organizational level:
• 
Processes at maturity level 3 help to establish a feeling among the team members 
that consistency is maintained in following the process across the organization or the 
business-unit level
• 
Projects perform tailoring on their defined processes as per the tailoring guidelines
Let’s examine the distinguishing factors between maturity level 2 and 3.
At maturity level 2, the complete process or its descriptions can differ from one project to another. In 
other words, processes are not common throughout the organization.
At maturity level 3, standard processes are common across the organization. Processes can be tailored 
for one project or organizational unit by referring to the organization’s defined tailoring guidelines.
Just as with capability level 3, the processes for maturity level 3 are written in a rigorous manner and 
managed proactively. Hence at level 3, processes are considered more consistent, and the only noticeable 
differences are allowed by the tailoring guidelines.
2.1.2.4  Maturity Level 4: Quantitatively Managed
Quantitatively managed means that an organization establishes objectives quantitatively for quality and 
process performance at both the organizational and project level. It then uses these quantitative objectives 
as criteria in managing projects:
• 
Quantitative objectives are defined by assessing the needs of the customer, end 
users, and organization and process implementers (Figure 2-3 shows an example 
of this where the measure schedule variance is -10% to 10%, and the measure effort 
variance is -15% to 15%)

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
14
• 
Quality and process performance objectives are viewed via statistical means and 
managed throughout the life of projects
• 
Process performance baselines and models are implemented that help to set 
the quality and process performance objectives; this will help an organization in 
achieving its business objectives
Figure 2-3.  An example quantitative objective
So, what is the critical distinguishing factor between maturity levels 3 and 4? At level 4, we can predict 
the process performance.
The project and selected subprocesses are controlled by using statistical and other quantitative 
techniques. Also, predictions are made by performing statistical analysis on the refined process data.
■
■Note   At maturity level 3, process performance cannot be predicted.
2.1.2.5  Maturity Level 5: Optimizing
Optimizing means that an organization focuses on improving its processes in a continuous manner by 
understanding its business objectives and performance needs (in quantitative terms).
Also, organizations use a quantitative approach to understand the variation inherent in the process and 
the causes of process outcomes:
• 
The goal is to improve the process performance by following an incremental and 
innovative approach
• 
Quality and process performance objectives are defined at the organizational level
• 
Defined processes and supporting technology combine to help organizations 
achieve the measurable improvements

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
15
Here are the critical distinguishing factors between maturity levels 4 and 5:
• 
At maturity level 4, the organizational and project teams understand and control 
performance at the subprocess level, and use these results to manage the projects
• 
At maturity level 5, the organization focuses on managing and improving 
organizational performance; this is ensured by collecting and analyzing the data 
from various projects
■
■Note   Be sure to collect data and perform analysis; this will help you to identify the gaps in process 
performance. Also, prepare a gap closure plan and take appropriate actions to ensure that organizational 
process improvement is measureable.
Let’s summarize the comparison between Capability and Maturity Levels as depicted in the Table 2-1.

■Note  The names used for the capability and maturity levels at levels 2 and 3 are similar in both 
representations (i.e., Managed and Defined).
2.1.3  An Approach for Process Improvement
Approaches for process improvement in CMMI are called representations; capability levels and maturity 
levels have their own respective representations:
• 
Continuous: a continuous representation approach leads us towards capability levels
• 
Staged: a staged representation approach leads us towards maturity levels

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
16
Figure 2-5.  Staged representation
Figure 2-4.  Continuous representation
Looking at both representations reveals that the structure of continuous and staged representations  
is similar.
They contain similar components (e.g., process areas, specific goals, and specific practices) and have 
similar hierarchies.
In continuous representation, you can select a particular process area for improvement, along with the 
desired capability level for that process area.
In staged representation, you can select multiple process areas for improvement within a maturity level.
Based on our understanding of these levels, we can decide whether we want to proceed with a 
continuous (capability levels) or a staged (maturity levels) representation approach to implement CMMI DEV.
Now let’s look at the structure of these representations (see Figures 2-4 and 2-5).

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
17
■
■Note   Both capability and maturity levels will lead to the same end result (i.e., process improvement).
To attain either a higher capability or maturity level, an organization needs to satisfy all the goals of a 
process area or a set of process areas from a given improvement perspective.
The Process Area boxes in the two figures lead us to an obvious question, “Is CMMI a process description?”
An important thing to bear in mind about CMMI as a model is that it is neither a process nor a 
description of the process.
For CMMI beginners, it has long been a misconception that CMMI is a process which we can follow and 
apply “AS IS” to the areas of an organization or its projects.
If CMMI is not a process, then what do we mean by Process Area?
In the CMMI model, a process area contains set of related practices. When these practices are 
implemented together, they satisfy the goals of the process area, which means that process improvement has 
been accomplished in that process area.
CMMI contains a set of different and unique process areas that are interconnected or have an inter-
relationship with each other.
In the CMMI DEV Model, there are 22 process areas in total. (We will learn more about these process 
areas later in this and other chapters.)
You saw the terms goals and practices in both representations shown in Figures 2-4 and 2-5. Let’s take a 
closer look at how they fit into CMMI.
As components (design) of CMMI, the terms goals and practices are present under each process area.
Let’s visualize CMMI’s structure first; we need to understand how process areas, goals, and practices are 
placed as components within CMMI.
Figure 2-6.  How process areas, goals, and practices fit together
And now let’s look more specifically at goals and practices.
2.1.3.1  What Is a Specific Goal?
A specific goal (SG) is unique and present in each process area.
Under each specific goal, there are certain “specific practices” (SP). When we implement the specific 
practices successfully, then we satisfy the specific goal. Once all the specific goals are satisfied, it means the 
process area is satisfied.
During CMMI appraisals, specific goals are evaluated to check whether the process area is satisfied.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
18
2.1.3.2  What Is a Specific Practice?
A specific practice is the activity description; when a specific practice is implemented, it helps to achieve the 
associated specific goal (see Figure 2-7).
Figure 2-7.  A specific goal and practice
2.1.3.3  What Is a Generic Goal?
Generic goals are called “generic” because they have the same goal statement, which is common across all 
22 process areas.
Generic goals are used during the CMMI appraisals to evaluate whether a process area is satisfied or  
not satisfied.
2.1.3.4  What Is a Generic Practice?
A generic practice is called such because it is the same practice that is used across all 22 process areas.
A generic practice is present under generic goals. A generic practice contains an activity description 
that, once implemented, helps in achieving the generic goal of a process area (see Figure 2-8).

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
19
Visually, the structure of generic goals and generic practices looks like a grid, where the different levels 
are shown horizontally and the specific goals within that level are shown as a vertical list of boxes with 
incremented numbers (see Figure 2-9).

What this means:
We have to define the policy for all process areas (e.g., 
Project Planning and Requirements Management) 
which we are implementing in our organization.
Doing this ensures that the policy is visible to 
all those who could be affected (e.g., Senior 
Management and Project delivery teams).
In other words, everyone involved in the organization 
commits to following and executing their processes 
as defined in the organization.
Note: Policy examples for each process area are 
covered later in the book.

Plan the  
Process
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have to 
identify all parameters that would be required to 
perform the process.
What this means:
In simple terms, we must have a plan to execute the 
process.
What should the plan include? Here are some 
examples:
•	 A written process to guide how the process needs to 
be executed
•	 Requirements for developing the work products
•	 A plan for managing dependencies (i.e., tasks, 
resources, etc.)
•	 A plan for managing resources (i.e., SW, HW, 
people, etc.)
•	 A plan for managing relevant stakeholders
•	 A plan for risk management
•	 A plan for training
•	 A plan for project monitoring and control
•	 A plan for management reviews
Once the plan is prepared, we need to ensure that the 
plan is reviewed and agreed to by all the stakeholders.
It is an important activity because, when we perform 
the process, we do not perform it alone. It is performed 
by multiple people.
Hence, all stakeholders must be committed to the plan.

Provide 
Resources
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have 
to ensure that all the required resources are made 
available to perform the process.
What this means:
We have to plan, monitor and arrange the required 
resources whenever their use is planned. Resource 
types could be infrastructure (i.e., a facility, software, 
hardware, etc.), people, tools, and so on.
To execute and satisfy all the process areas, resources 
are necessary.
GP 2.4
Assign 
Responsibility
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we must 
ensure that people are accountable for the processes 
they perform. This includes achieving the desired 
results of that process.
What this means:
We have to clearly define and assign the 
responsibility to people to perform specific process 
and tasks.
We have to ensure that people understand and also 
accept their responsibilities.
One approach for assigning a responsibility is to assign 
it through job descriptions or documented plans.
GP 2.5
Train People
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have to 
ensure people possess right skills and expertise in 
performing or supporting the process.
What this means:
We need to analyze the skills and expertise of our 
team members. And upon analysis, if we find a gap in 
the required skill level, we need to plan and deliver 
the necessary training to our team members to bridge 
the gap.
Hence, training people is important. People must 
have the requisite skills for performing a process in 
order to achieve the desired results.
For every process area in the CMMI model, people 
should be trained to perform it.
In organizations, training delivery is managed by the 
separate training team/department.
Provided training might include on-the-job training, 
mentoring, classroom training, and so on.

Control Work 
Products
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we must 
manage and control the integrity of certain work 
products. These are identified in the project plan for 
executing the process.
What this means:
When we prepare the plan to perform the process, 
at that time we also have to identify all the work 
products which would be produced and are required 
to be put under configuration management.
Controlling the work product here means work 
products are version controlled with proper naming 
conventions, they have a baseline, they are access 
controlled, and so on.

Stakeholders
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have to

What this means:
We have to identify all the relevant stakeholders 
during the planning of the process, and then monitor 
their participation at regular intervals.
Phases where stakeholders could be involved include 
the following:
•	 Planning
•	 Decision making
•	 Commitments
•	 Reviews
•	 Defining requirements
•	 Problem resolutions

To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have to 
ensure that the process is monitored and controlled

Doing this gives us visibility into the execution of the 
process; whenever required, corrective actions can 
be taken.
What this means:
After performing the process, we have to do the 
following tasks:
•	 Assess the actual progress against the plan
•	 Evaluate accomplishments and the results 
achieved
•	 Evaluate deviations against the plan
•	 Identify issues in executing the process
•	 Discuss the results and status with management
GP 2.9
Objectively 
Evaluate 
Adherence
To fulfill or satisfy the generic practice, we need to 
ensure that the process is implemented as planned.
What this means:
Identify people who are not responsible for 
performing the process activities which need to be 
evaluated.
This is necessary for an unbiased evaluation.
The people identified will evaluate the process 
performance at regular intervals and will confirm 
adherence by publishing the results.
Corrective actions will be required when there is any 
issue observed in process adherence.
GP 2.10
Review 
Status with 
Higher Level 
Management
To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have to

visibility into the process performance.
What this means:
We have to report the progress of the process 
execution, including its results (i.e., actual vs. 
planned). Management must also be informed of any 
risks or issues.
Doing this ensures that any support or action needed 
from management can be executed in a timely 
manner, without any last-minute surprises.
The management team could include program 
managers, delivery heads, or VPs.

What this means:
We have defined the processes covering all the 
process areas of the CMMI Dev model which an 
organization wants to implement.
We have defined the tailoring guidelines, which can be 
used to tailor any process whenever the need arises.
We must maintain the tailoring records, and we must 
update the processes whenever necessary.

To fulfill or satisfy this generic practice, we have to

What this means:
During the process planning and process execution 
phases, we must observe new experiences.
Those experiences that we collect will help us to 
analyze the process activities, and then categorize 
them as mistakes or best practices. We can also call 
them lessons learned and process improvement 
suggestions.
Publishing such experiences might help other 
organization members who will work on a similar 
process in the future. These future workers can 
benefit from the lessons learned.
Table 2-2.  (continued)
2.2  Process Areas
Process areas are viewed differently in the two representations. Figures 2-10 and 2-11 show the use of 
process areas in continuous and staged representations, respectively.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
26
Figure 2-11.  Visualizing process areas in staged representation
Figure 2-10.  Process areas in continuous representation

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
27
In continuous representation, process areas are divided into four categories:
• 
Process management
• 
Project management
• 
Engineering
• 
Support
When process areas are selected for implementation, check and analyze the maturity level to be 
attained for the process area (i.e., select the appropriate capability level).
For example, assume an organization decides to achieve capability level 2 for one process area and 
capability level 3 for another process area.
Once an organization achieves a capability level, it should always target achieving the next capability 
level in the same process areas or target a larger number of process areas.
For example, once an organization attains capability level 3 in almost all of the process areas, then 
the next step for that organization should be to plan and attain high maturity process areas and track the 
capability of each through capability level 3.
So, how should an organization select process areas combined with their required capability levels?
This is described in a target profile, which defines the process areas that need to be addressed and the 
capability levels targeted for each. It also describes the goals and practices the organization will have to 
address in its process-improvement efforts.
In staged representation, process areas are grouped into maturity levels that indicate which process 
areas will be implemented to achieve each maturity level.
For example, at maturity level 2, a predefined set of process areas might require an organization to 
achieve all the goals of all the process areas.
Once maturity level 2 is achieved, the organization’s focus should be on achieving maturity level 3 
process areas, and so on.
Generic goals present in each process area are predefined. Generic goal 2 is applicable to maturity level 
2, and generic goal 3 is applicable to maturity levels 3 through 5.
2.3  Mapping Process Areas
In CMMI, process areas are mapped into four categories, along with their defined maturity levels.
These four categories include the following:
• 
Project management
• 
Engineering
• 
Support
• 
Process Management
You might wonder why there are only four categories. Why not five, or perhaps six? What you need to 
keep in mind is that the CMMI model was designed by a team of industry experts who have considered these 
issues from all possible scenarios and perspectives.
We will cover these process areas later in the book, at which time it will be easier to see how these 
process areas relate to the aforementioned four categories.
Figure 2-12 shows a lot of useful information, including process areas and their abbreviations. It also 
includes a category column that explains which category a given process area belongs to, and a maturity 
column that tells us roughly which maturity level a given process area is placed in according to the CMMI 
Dev Model.

• 
Prepare for risk management (i.e., document the risk management strategy, 
categorizing risks and defining parameters to evaluate and control risks)
• 
Determine risk sources and categories
• 
Identify and prepare a source list of risks (i.e., a list of internal and external 
sources)

Project phases (e.g., requirements, design, coding, and testing)
• 
Project management risks (e.g., budget risks, schedule risks, and  
resource risks)
• 
Determine risk parameters (e.g., risk likelihood, risk consequences, and defining 
threshold values for risk categories)
• 
Risk likelihood indicates the probability of a risk occurring

Develop mitigation plans for risks (select risks to proactively reduce their 
potential impact)
• 
Develop risk contingency plans
• 
Assign responsibility to track and address each identified risk

mitigation plan is initiated)

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
34
2.3.6  Supplier Agreement Management
Use supplier agreement management (SAM) when the development of the product or one component 
of the product is not done by the project team, yet the team is responsible for delivering that product or 
component to the client.
The Supplier Agreement Management process area covers the best practices related to establishing 
supplier agreements:
• 
Determine the acquisition type for a product or a component of the product
• 
Purchase modified COTS products
• 
Obtain the product (or component) through supplier agreement
• 
Obtain the product (or component) from an in-house supplier
• 
Obtain the product (or component) from the customer
• 
Obtain the product (or component) from a preferred supplier
• 
Select suppliers
• 
Before selecting any supplier, it is important to evaluate suppliers based on 
their ability or past experience in delivering the required product or product 
component
• 
Maintain a list of candidate suppliers
• 
Maintain a list of preferred suppliers
• 
Maintain records that evaluate the suppliers (i.e., the proposals evaluated, the 
basis of selecting a candidate supplier, and the advantages and disadvantages of 
each)
• 
Establish and maintain supplier agreements
• 
Create a written agreement between the organization and the supplier (i.e., a 
statement of work, a contract, etc.)
• 
Provide an overview of the work to be done in the written agreement
• 
Draft the agreement based on the type of work (and insert language based on 
what you feel is right)
• 
Agreements are usually reviewed by the legal/advisory team
• 
Include things in your agreement that fit your organization’s needs; typical things to 
include might be the following:
• 
Establish a statement of work, including terms and conditions, deliverables, 
schedule, and product acceptance procedures
• 
Document who is responsible and authorized to make changes to the supplier 
agreement
• 
Document a requirements change management procedure
• 
Document procedures to be followed by the supplier
• 
Document when reviews will be done with the supplier
• 
Document responsibilities of the supplier during the maintenance period

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
35
2.3.7  Satisfy Supplier Agreements
An organization should perform activities with the supplier as documented in the written agreement. On 
a regular basis, it should track the supplier work status and performance (i.e., track the schedule, effort, 
and cost). It should also maintain progress reports and review the processes being used by the supplier in 
delivering the product.
Before accepting the acquired product, an organization should evaluate and accept the deliverables 
shared by the supplier, as per the set acceptance criteria in the agreement. An organization should also 
share the feedback/bugs/action points with the supplier if deliverables shared are unacceptable or need 
corrections.
2.3.8  Ensure a Transition of Products
There should be a smooth transition when the final deliverable/product is transferred to the organization by the 
supplier. Hence, the transition plan should be prepared and agreed upon by the organization and the supplier.
What follows are the points to be ensured during the product transition:
• 
Ensure that the required facility is available to receive and store the product
• 
Ensure that training is planned and conducted for the people responsible for 
receiving, storing, and maintaining the product (i.e., the product should be 
maintained as per the supplier agreement and license terms)
• 
Ensure that the transition plan is monitored and transition report is shared with the 
relevant stakeholders for the status update
2.3.9  Quantitative Project Management (QPM)
The purpose of the Quantitative Project Management (QPM) process area is to manage the project in 
quantitative terms (see Figure 2-13); doing so will help the organization to achieve the project’s established 
quality and process performance objectives:
• 
Prepare for quantitative management
• 
Define a project’s objectives
• 
Define measurable quality and process performance objectives for the project
• 
Document the project’s objectives
• 
Objectives should detail the needs and priorities of the customer, end users, 
and other relevant stakeholders
• 
Objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
36
• 
Measure the quality of the project’s attributes
• 
The mean time between failures
• 
The cycle time
• 
The defect escape rates
• 
Proactively identify risks, such as the chance that the project’s quality and process 
performance objectives will not be met
• 
If there are conflicts among the project’s quality and process performance objectives, 
ensure that they have been resolved (e.g., if one objective cannot be achieved 
without compromising another)
• 
Maintain traceability from the source to the project’s quality and process 
performance objectives
• 
The sources subject to tracing can be highly varied
• 
The organization’s quality and process performance objectives
• 
The customer’s quality objectives
• 
The business objectives
Figure 2-13.  Documenting the process objectives

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
37
• 
Maintain the following documents
• 
The quality and process performance objective sheet
• 
The project defined process (defines how the project will be able to achieve its 
quality and process performance objectives)
• 
Defined criteria for evaluating process alternatives for the project
• 
Defined criteria can include the following:
• 
Quality and process performance objectives
• 
Project lifecycle models
• 
Stakeholder requirements
• 
Identify alternative processes and subprocesses for the project
• 
Analysis of process performance baselines (created at the organization level) 
can help in identifying subprocesses that will facilitate achieving the project’s 
quality and process performance objectives
• 
Subprocesses could also be identified from the organization’s set of standard 
processes
• 
Alternative subprocesses that best meet the criteria should be selected
• 
Select measures and analytic techniques
• 
Common measures that support the quantitative management should be 
identified from the organizational process assets
• 
Measures which could be used to manage the subprocesses should be identified
• 
Specify the operational definitions of measures, their collection points in 
subprocesses, and how the integrity of measures will be determined
• 
Identify the statistical and other quantitative techniques to be used in 
quantitative management

deficiencies
• 
Monitor the capability and performance of the selected subprocesses, and then 
address deficiencies
2.3.10  Engineering Process Areas
So far we have covered Project Management process areas. Next, we’ll look at the second category of process 
areas, Engineering. These process areas contain best practices for the roles to be played by the business/
requirements analyst, the architect, GUI designers, technical/functional leads, and developers and testers in 
an organization.
2.3.10.1  Requirements Development
The focus of the Requirements Development (RD) process area is to collect and analyze requirements. We 
can segregate requirements into three different types:
• 
Customer Requirements
• 
Product Requirements
• 
Product Component Requirements
RD covers the best practices related to developing customer requirements.
2.3.10.2  Developing the Customer Requirements
Here we need to elicit requirements from all the stakeholders’ points of view. It’s important to understand 
their needs and expectations. Also, we need to proactively identify those requirements which are not 
communicated or provided by the client/stakeholder, but are essential for the product or product 
component delivery.
We can use the following techniques to elicit the requirements:
• 
Interview sessions
• 
Prototypes
• 
Brainstorming
• 
Market surveys
• 
Use cases

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
39
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Requirement Q&As
• 
Prototypes
• 
Survey results
• 
Meeting minutes
2.3.10.3  Transform the Stakeholder Needs into Customer Requirements
For building customer requirements, you need to consolidate all the inputs/information received from all 
stakeholders, but also do the following:
• 
Check whether any information is missing, and update the missing part
• 
Determine whether any conflicts exist in the requirements
In scenarios where the customer provides only the set of requirements, the customer requirements 
could conflict with the needs and expectations of the relevant stakeholders. Hence, it is important to resolve 
the conflict before treating customer requirements as a recognized set of requirements.
Documents to be maintained include documented customer requirements (i.e., a business 
requirements specification).
2.3.10.4  Develop the Product Requirements
You’ll need to analyze the customer requirements to arrive at detailed product requirements:
• 
Establish product and product component requirements
• 
Associate the requirements with product life cycle phases
In scenarios where we chose to follow an iterative or incremental development model, the 
requirements must be allocated to iterations or increments based on the following criteria:
• 
Customer priorities
• 
Technology related issues
• 
Project objectives
You will also need to document customer functional and quality attributes requirements. This will help 
when describing what the product will do. Functional requirements have to be described in technical terms, 
to create the product design.
Examples of quality attribute measures include the following:
• 
Production of a simple report shall take less than 20 seconds for 95% of the cases
• 
The system shall be able to process 100 payment transactions per second in peak load
Documents to be maintained include documented technical requirements (i.e., a software 
requirements specification)

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
40
2.3.10.5  Allocate the Product Component Requirements
Next, we will need to allocate the product component requirements; these include the following tasks:
• 
Allocate requirements to functions
• 
Allocate requirements to each product components
• 
Capture design constraints for the product and product components
• 
Allocate requirements to the delivery increments
2.3.10.6  Identify the Interface Requirements
We will also need to identify interfaces between the functions, as well as ensure that interfaces identified are 
both external and internal to the product. Also, we need to ensure that requirements are developed for the 
identified interfaces (e.g., the data characteristics of the software).
2.3.10.7  Analyze and Validate Requirements
We must also validate requirements to ensure that the product being produced will perform as intended in 
the environment it is supposed to perform in. As the name suggests, this is simply a matter of validating our 
requirements and helping us prevent the cost of failure.
2.3.10.8  Establish Operational Concepts and Scenarios
We need to document operational concepts and scenarios (i.e., the sequence of events that might occur 
during product development, deployment, delivery, support (including maintenance and sustainment), 
training, and disposal.
This means we need to define the environment in which the product or product component will 
operate, including its boundaries and constraints. One aspect of this is creating use cases.
We also need to establish a definition of required functionality and quality attributes. A functional 
definition can include actions, sequence, inputs, outputs, or other information that communicates the 
manner in which the product will be used. Quality attributes can also be important from business needs 
perspective, and they serve as an input to the design process.
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Definitions of the required functionality and quality attributes (document these in 
the SRS)
• 
Activity diagrams and use cases (document these in the SRS)
2.3.10.9  Analyze the Requirements
Review that the requirements are complete, feasible, realizable, and verifiable. Ensure that any risk 
assessment conducted with respect to the requirements is documented.
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
A requirements review defects report
• 
A requirements clarification report
• 
A risk register
• 
A risk section could also be added in the SRS

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
41
2.3.10.10  Validate the Requirements
You also need to ensure that the requirements are validated by the client/end user before initiating the 
design/development work. It is important to instill confidence in the client that the requirements collected/
defined will be delivered as required in the product.
Examples of validation techniques include prototypes, demonstration/product presentation, 
simulations, and so on.
The documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Documented prototypes
• 
Presentations
• 
Meeting minutes
2.3.10.11  Technical Solution
The focus of the technical solution is to design and implement solutions according to the requirements. The 
Technical Solution (TS) process area covers the best practices related to selecting component solutions, 
which includes the following tasks:
• 
Develop solutions for design alternatives that feature current vs. new technologies, 
COTS products, tools and so on, as required to implement the requirements (there 
will always be more than one possible solution to implement a requirement)
• 
Develop the criteria to select the best solution from the multiple alternatives 
available (i.e., criteria examples are cost, time, product performance, etc.)
• 
Document the selection criteria for selecting the best/final option among the 
available alternatives list (i.e., the reasons for selecting a particular option/solution)
Documents to be maintained include reports that evaluate the design, new technology, COTS products, 
tools, and so on.
Here are a couple things to keep in mind when developing the design:
• 
Employ techniques and methods known for producing effective design  
(e.g., prototypes, structural models, object oriented design, and entity relationship 
models)
• 
Ensure that design standards are adhered to while preparing the design
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Product architecture
• 
Design standards
To establish a technical data package, you need to document the required product components levels:
• 
The subsystem
• 
Hardware configuration items
• 
Computer software configuration items
• 
Computer software product components
Documents to be maintained include those related to developing high- and low-level design.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
42
Follow these criteria when designing interfaces:
• 
Define the interface criteria
• 
Identify the interfaces associated with other product components and external items
• 
Apply the interface criteria to the design alternatives
• 
Document the selected interface designs and the rationale for the selection
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
The interfaces in high- and low-level design
• 
The interfaces evaluation report (i.e., the DAR record)
2.3.10.12  Perform Make, Buy, or Reuse Analyses
Make, buy or reuse analysis is done to determine which product or product component needs to be acquired 
as part of the project/product delivery. The purpose of this analysis is to understand which product or 
product component cannot or should not be developed in-house, whether due to its high complexity, the 
lack of skills of your team members, or any other reasons.
It is also possible that some product or product component is already available as part of the delivery of 
past projects, and that it could be reused in the current product development.
Hence, by acquiring or reusing product components, you can save time and effort developing the 
current product or component.
In that vein, we need to do the following:
• 
Define criteria for when to reuse a product component
• 
Analyze designs to determine if a product or component should be developed, 
reused, or purchased
Documents to be maintained include a make, buy, or reuse analysis report. This document should 
describe how to implement a product design to develop software code. Examples of software coding 
methods include the following:
• 
Structured programming
• 
Object oriented programming
• 
Automatic code generation
• 
Software code reuse
During the software code development, the organization needs to adhere to the appropriate coding 
standards (e.g., language standards like .net and Java) and take these steps to ensure quality control:
• 
Plan and perform software code peer reviews
• 
Perform unit testing
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Source code
• 
Coding methods
• 
Coding standards

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
43
• 
Peer review reports
• 
Unit test cases
• 
Results
2.3.10.13  Develop Product Support Documentation
To install, operate, and maintain the product, you’ll also need to provide support documentation to the client.
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
User manual
• 
Maintenance manual
• 
End user training material
• 
Online help
2.3.10.14  Product Integration
The purpose of product integration (PI) is to assemble and integrate the product from the product 
components. We need to ensure that the integrated product behaves properly before we deliver it to the 
client. Product integration can be done in two ways:
• 
All the product components can be integrated, tested, and delivered to the client
• 
The components can be integrated in incremental stages (e.g., if an iterative model 
is used for product development, then the continuous integration path could be 
followed to assemble the product components)
The Product Integration process area covers the best practices related to preparing for PI:
• 
Prepare and maintain an integration strategy
• 
Product components are available to facilitate product integration
• 
Integration has to be conducted in a single build or in incremental builds
• 
An integration procedure is defined
• 
Features need to be tested in each iteration/build when using iterative 
development
• 
Interfaces need to be managed
• 
An integration environment needs to be created
• 
Testing tools/equipment need to be created
• 
Test results/reports need to be created and evaluated
• 
Evaluate and select the best integration strategy to be adopted
• 
Evaluate and choose the best integration strategy method from the options 
available (use the DAR method for evaluation)
• 
Upon selection of the best option according to you, document the reasons for 
selecting the option

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
44
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
The product integration strategy
• 
The DAR record (for evaluating the options for the integration method)
Follow these steps to create the product integration environment:
• 
Assess the requirements for creating the environment
• 
Enumerate all the procedures required to verify the environment
• 
Conduct a make or buy analysis (whether to create or buy the environment from outside
• 
Create your own environment if the environment cannot be acquired from an 
outside source
Documents to be maintained include anything that supports the fact that the integration environment 
is available and has been verified.
To that end, you’ll want to create a verification checklist:
• 
Create the procedures and criteria for product integration
• 
Create procedures to conduct the integration in a planned manner
• 
Indicate the number of iterations to be performed
• 
Define the integration sequence
• 
Specify the level of testing to be conducted
• 
Spell out the defined threshold for performance deviation
• 
Indicate the interfaces to be verified (e.g., human-machine interfaces, message 
interfaces, electrical interfaces, or climatic interfaces)
• 
Specify the resources required (i.e., testing tools, staff, environment  
availability, etc.)
Documents to be maintained include the integration procedure (describing your integration criteria).
This will help you ensure that your interfaces are compatible. You’ll also need to review all interfaces to 
ensure they are correctly identified and that their coverage is complete.
Documents to be maintained include the review report or record (all identified issues should be closed).
Take these steps to manage the interfaces:
• 
Ensure that interfaces remain compatible with each other for the entire product life cycle
• 
Resolve any identified issues
Documents to be maintained include those that cover the relationship tables that describe the 
relationship of product components with each other and the external environment.
Here’s an agreed upon list of application program interfaces (APIs) that cover when product 
components are assembled and delivered:
• 
Perform checks to determine whether the product components delivered are ready 
for integration (i.e., a readiness checklist to provide the component acceptance)
• 
Perform checks to ensure whether integration environment is ready and available

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
45
• 
Assemble the product and product components by following the defined procedures 
and criteria
• 
Change/revise the integration procedure if the criteria in the defined procedure does 
not work

The third category consists of Organizational process areas; as the term organization implies, these process 
areas contain best practices for the roles to be played by the software engineering process group (SEPG) and 
the training group in an organization.
2.3.11.1  Organizational Performance Management (OPM)
The Organizational Performance Management (OPM) process area helps you manage business performance 
and maintain business objectives.
The purpose of OPM is to periodically review and revise the business objectives, along with quality 
and process performance objectives. It is important to evaluate the business objectives to ensure they are 
relevant as of today and aligned with the business strategies. For example, you might compare the current 
business objectives with their actual performance results:
• 
Ensure that revised business objectives are reviewed and approved by the senior 
management
• 
Ensure that revised business objectives are communicated to all
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
A revised business objectives sheet
• 
A revised quality and process performance objectives sheet
• 
An analysis of process performance data
On a periodic basis, we need to review the quality and process performance objectives to determine 
whether the organization is able to meet the current defined business objectives.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
49
For example, if cycle time is one of the critical business objectives, then we need to collect the data from 
different cycle times and analyze the overall cycle time data with the defined value. If the value matches 
or is around the defined value, then the organization has the capability to achieve the business objective; 
otherwise, the organization should revise the business objective value/threshold:
• 
Identify gaps in the quality and process performance
• 
Identify if there is any associated risk due to not being able to meet a given business 
objective

Identify improvements as incremental or innovative
• 
Incremental improvements are simple and inexpensive to deploy, and may not 
require rigorous validation (e.g., adding one checkpoint in peer review checklist 
or a minor update in the tool)
• 
Innovative improvements take a more transformational approach to 
performance improvements
Incremental and innovative improvements are identified by experienced people who have spent a long 
time in process and technology, or they are identified by a team of experts whose job is to find innovative 
improvements. These experts can take the following steps:

will be left to the individual project or support group
• 
Analyze and negotiate how training needs identified by projects and support groups 
will be met
• 
Document commitments from the staff for providing training support to projects and 
support groups
You need to maintain documents that cover common project and support group training needs.
Outlining training commitments involves creating and maintaining an annual training plan. Setting the 
content of the plan includes spelling out the following:
•

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
60
2.3.12.1  Causal Analysis and Resolution
The Causal Analysis and Resolution process area helps you analyze causes and problems in both negative 
and positive ways. If there is a negative impact, this process area can help you prevent the causes or 
problems from reoccurring.
If a cause has a positive impact, this process area can help you incorporate the cause into processes 
in a way that contributes to more successful outcomes in your organization. This will help in improving/
repeating the performance of the process.
To begin, you need to figure out the causes of selected outcomes. You might be wondering why you are 
interested only in selected outcomes. This is because not all outcomes have an equal impact, and only some 
impacts require an action.
The next step is to select outcomes for performing the analysis. We can initiate/plan analysis in two ways:
	
1.	
Trigger an event
	
2.	
Execute a periodic/planned activity at the beginning of a phase or task
You’ll need to gather data for analysis (real time/current data would be best for this analysis). Types of 
data to gather for this include the following:
• 
Customer or end user reported defects
• 
Peer review comments/defects
• 
Test defects
• 
Process capability problems
• 
Customer feedback points/low ratings
After the selecting the type of data to analyze, you need to select the outcomes to analyze further. 
Methods which could be used to select outcomes include the following:
• 
Pareto analysis
• 
Histograms
During the selection of outcomes, focus on their source, impact, frequency of occurrence, the cost of 
performing the analysis, the required time and resources needed, and so on.
Also, clearly define the scope of analysis, improvement expected, the stakeholders that will be affected, 
and so on.
At this point, you’re ready to analyze the causes:
• 
Perform root cause analysis with members who are responsible for performing the task
• 
Identify root causes using appropriate methods
• 
Cause and effect (fishbone) diagram
• 
Check sheets
• 
Group the causes based on their identified root causes
• 
Inadequate training and skills
• 
Making mistakes in procedures
• 
Create an action plan
• 
Address negative causes and prevent them from reoccurring
• 
Incorporate best practices into the processes

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
61
Examples of preventive actions include the following:
• 
Training
• 
Tools
• 
Methods
Examples of best practices include the following:
• 
Create an activity checklist to avoid common problems
• 
Update the process to remove error-prone steps
• 
Automate part or all of a process
Documents to be maintained include an action plan. This means you’ll need to analyze and select an 
action plan for implementation.
It is important to analyze and select a variety of factors are when implementing your plan. Factors to 
analyze might include timelines, cost, stakeholders involved, benefits expected, and so on.
Implement an action plan to accomplish the following:
• 
Track the plan (i.e. tasks, people, etc.)
• 
Review results
• 
Track action items to closure
Let’s walk through what an improvement action plan might look like when using a new tool. Following 
these steps will help you evaluate the effect of implemented actions:
• 
Measure and analyze the change in performance of affected processes
• 
Review the before and after analysis of the performance
• 
Determine whether the change in performance has brought a positive impact (i.e., 
does it help you meet project quality and process performance objectives?)
• 
Plan an appropriate action if the change in performance does not help you achieve 
the expected project quality benefits
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
An updated plan
• 
An updated action item log/register
• 
A before-and-after process performance analysis report
Be sure to record your causal analysis data:
• 
The purpose of this is to make the data available to other projects, so that they can 
use/refer to the data in order to achieve similar results
• 
Once the implemented action plan is found to be effective, submit the information to 
the organization for inclusion in the organizational processes
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Causal analysis data
• 
An improvement proposal

2.3.12.2  Configuration Management
The Configuration Management (CM) process area helps you accomplish several tasks:
• 
Identify configurable items
• 
Perform configuration control
• 
Maintain the integrity of baselines
• 
Maintain configuration status accounting
• 
Conduct configuration audits
• 
Establish baselines for work products
• 
Identify configurable items
• 
Configuration items could be hardware and equipment, as well as software and 
documentation
• 
The criteria for selecting a configurable item are based on whether a work 
product is expected to change over time (e.g., is there a change in the 
requirements?)
Examples of configurable items include the following:
• 
A requirement specification
• 
Design
• 
Source code
• 
Test plans and procedures
• 
Tools
For each configurable item, assign a unique identification mark (e.g., Design_<client name>_1.0.doc). 
You’ll need to decide when to place each configuration item under a configuration management. Here are 
some examples:
• 
Work product test readiness
• 
A project-lifecycle phase
• 
The degree of control analyzed on each work product
• 
An owner assigned for each configuration item
Documents to be maintained include a configuration-management plan.
2.3.12.3  Create a Configuration-Management System
You’ll need to manage multiple levels of control for the work product. Examples of this include the following:
• 
Uncontrolled: Changes can be done by any staff member
• 
Work in progress: The author is controlling the changes
• 
Released: Changes are controlled by authorized personnel only; when any changes 
are made, the relevant stakeholders are updated

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
63
Following these steps will help you build an effective configuration-management system:
• 
Manage access control for each project member; the goal is to ensure that only 
authorized people have access to the relevant project folders or configuration 
management system (i.e., CVS, VSS, etc.)
• 
Store, update, and retrieve configuration management records
• 
Create release baselines for internal use, as well as for delivery to the customer
• 
A software baseline might include requirements, design, source code files, build 
files, and user documentation
• 
Obtain approval from the change control board (CCB) for the creation and release of 
baselines for configuration items
• 
Track the configuration items which are in a baseline state
You will also need to track and control changes:
• 
Track change requests for configuration items
• 
Track the change requests received in a change request tracker sheet/tool
• 
Perform impact analysis based on the received change request
• 
Set the priority for each received change request
• 
Review change requests in the CCB meeting and get approval from relevant 
stakeholders
• 
Track the status of each change request until closure
You will also need to track change requests for configuration items:
• 
For each configuration item, control the changes throughout the project or 
service life cycle
• 
Obtain approval from CCB members before updating a configuration item and 
placing it in the configuration management system
• 
All check in and check out should be done properly, without losing the previous 
versions
• 
Document the reasons for making the changes to a configuration item
• 
Following these steps will help you establish the integrity of a baseline:
• 
Ensure that each configuration item status is known, and that recovery of 
previous versions is possible
• 
Ensure that relevant stakeholders are aware of the configuration status of 
configuration items
• 
Ensure that the difference between the previous and the current baseline is known
• 
Ensure that you are using the latest version of the baseline

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
64
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
A change log
• 
Change requests
You can track configuration status by performing configuration audits:
• 
Check and ensure that configuration items are complete and correct in the 
configuration-management system
• 
Check and ensure that configuration management standards and procedures are 
followed
• 
Ensure that all configuration audit findings are closed
Documents to be maintained include a configuration audit report that shows the status of your findings.
2.3.12.4  Decision Analysis and Resolution
The Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR) process area enables us to analyze possible decisions during 
the project by using formal evaluation techniques/methods. The evaluation method will help us evaluate 
the alternatives identified, and then complete the process by choosing the best alternative available. We will 
need to do the following:
• 
Evaluate alternatives
• 
Create guidelines for decision-making analysis
Creating the guidelines is important, as it will help us to decide which decisions need to be evaluated 
using the formal evaluation technique/method. Only some decisions require evaluation because not every 
decision is significant enough to be evaluated through the formal evaluation process.
Here are some sample points that might be mentioned in the guidelines; these can help in determining 
which decisions to be put under the formal evaluation process:
• 
Issues which can lead to medium- to high-impact risk
• 
Decisions required for changing the work products placed under configuration 
management
• 
Decisions which could lead to delays over a certain amount of time
• 
Decisions which can affect achieving the objectives of the project
Here are some activities for which the formal evaluation process could be used:
• 
To procure material
• 
To design alternative decisions
• 
To make decisions on the cycle time or response time of a process
Documents to be maintained include a guideline document, which covers when to use the formal 
evaluation process.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
65
2.3.12.5  Establish Evaluation Criteria
The guideline document is the basis for evaluating alternative solutions. Each defined criteria will be given a 
ranking, and the highest ranked criteria get more weight in the selection process:
• 
Define the criteria for evaluating alternative solutions
• 
Rank the criteria and define the range and scale
• 
Rank and assess each selected criterion during the evaluation
• 
Document the rationale/reasons for choosing the selected criteria
Documents to be maintained include a guideline document that covers the criteria, with rankings that 
you can use to identify alternative solutions.
You can search the alternative solutions both within and outside the organization. Within the 
organization, you can determine whether any other business unit or department has already worked on the 
solution. And outside the organization, you can determine if you can procure a ready-made solution which 
can be plugged into the existing, running system. Brainstorm with a technical and/or experienced member 
of your teams to identify suitable alternatives:
• 
Document the final alternatives list
• 
Select from among the several evaluation methods
• 
Surveys
• 
Engineering studies
• 
Field experience and prototypes
• 
Expert judgment (i.e., the Delphi method)
Also, measures need to be identified to support the evaluation method (e.g., the impact on cost, 
schedule, performance, and risk).
Choose the evaluation method which is most relevant to support the evaluation process:
• 
Evaluate alternative solutions
• 
Evaluate alternatives based on the defined criteria and the selected evaluation method
• 
Evaluate uncertainty in the values for alternative solutions (e.g., if the score varies 
between two values, then you need to assess whether there is a significant difference 
and whether it will affect the selection of the final solution)
• 
Address the uncertainty by taking appropriate actions
• 
Perform simulations
• 
Build prototypes
• 
Run pilots
• 
Select the best solution from the alternatives evaluated
• 
Assess the risk, if any, associated with the solution selected from the alternatives
• 
Document the rationale for selecting the final solution and communicate the 
results to the relevant stakeholders

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
66
2.3.12.6  Measurement and Analysis
The purpose of the Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is to establish a measurement system 
in the organization or the software unit group of the organization. The measurement system will help 
in measuring and assessing the project objectives, which in turn will help in achieving the business/
organization objective.
Follow these steps to align the measurement and analysis activities:
• 
Establish the measurement objectives
• 
Document the measurement objectives
The measurement objectives enable you to perform measurement and analysis activities in the 
organization. Sources for the information needs and objectives can include the following:
• 
Project plans
• 
Business plans
• 
Interviews with managers
• 
Industry benchmarks
• 
Experience of other objects in the organization
You will want to review and update measurement objectives with management and other relevant 
stakeholders.
Documents to be maintained include your measurement objectives, which specify your organization’s 
measures.
Here, measurement objectives are converted into quantifiable measures. Examples of measures include 
the following:
• 
Effort variance
• 
Schedule variance
• 
Defect density
• 
Defects measure (i.e., the number of defects by severity and the total number of 
defects)
• 
Customer satisfaction ratings and trends
You will also need to document the operational definitions of measures. For example, you will need to 
state what to measure, how to measure it, the unit of measurement for each measure, as well as what has 
been included or excluded. Be sure to prioritize, review, and update measures with the relevant end users 
and stakeholders.
Documents to be maintained include the measurement guidelines. In these guidelines, you specify the 
process, including how measurement data will be obtained and stored:
• 
Identify measures for which existing sources of data are available
• 
Identify those measures for which data is needed, but which is currently not 
available
• 
Identify for each measure how to collect and store that data
• 
Work on the data-collection mechanism and procedures
• 
Update the measures and measurement objectives, as needed

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
67
You will also need to specify how measurement data is analyzed and communicated:
• 
Identify each type of data analysis to be conducted and the reports to be generated
• 
Select the appropriate data analysis methods and tools
• 
Pie charts
• 
Bar charts
• 
Histograms
• 
Line charts
• 
Review the measurement report with relevant stakeholders, end users, data 
providers, and so on
• 
Define the criteria for evaluating the measurement analysis results (e.g., determine 
whether the data is reliable, understandable, and can be used for decision making)
You will use the measurement guidelines to accomplish the following:
• 
Provide measurement results
• 
Collect measurement data
• 
Perform data calculations
• 
Perform data integrity checks (i.e., errors in data, unusual patterns, etc.)
• 
Analyze measurement data
• 
Perform analysis and interpret results to draw conclusions
• 
Review the results with the relevant stakeholders before releasing it to all the 
stakeholders
• 
Refine the measurement process based on the lessons learned during the 
reviews
Documents to be maintained include a draft of the measurement reports.
You will want to follow these guidelines to store data and results:
• 
Store data as per the defined data-storage procedures
• 
Ensure data is available to only authorized groups
• 
Prevent information from being used inappropriately
Documents to be maintained include the measurement data inventory.
Follow these steps to communicate the results:
• 
In a timely manner, regularly update the relevant stakeholders about the 
measurement results
• 
Help the relevant stakeholders to understand the results
Documents to be maintained include the measurement analysis report; this report needs to include 
read me guidelines for understanding the report.

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
68
2.3.12.7  Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA)
The Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) process area helps you to accomplish the following:
• 
Objectively evaluate the process actions and work products against the defined 
processes and standards in the organization QMS
• 
Identify process noncompliance issues
• 
Communicate feedback to project teams on the quality assurance activities
• 
Ensure that the process noncompliance issues are closed
Examples of objective evaluations include the following:
• 
Internal quality audits conducted by the audit group
• 
A review of work products
• 
Performance reviews at the work places (i.e., desk audits)
These steps can help you objectively evaluate processes:
• 
Define clear criteria for evaluating the processes
• 
Evaluate the selected processes
• 
Identify noncompliance issues
• 
Identify lessons learned for process improvement
Follow these steps to objectively evaluate work products:
• 
Define clear criteria for evaluating the work products
• 
Evaluate the selected work products based on the sampling criteria
• 
Identify noncompliance issues
• 
Identify the lessons learned for process improvement
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Evaluation reports
• 
Quality assurance reports
Follow these steps to track noncompliance issues and ensure resolution:
• 
Resolve the noncompliance issue with the relevant project members
• 
Document the noncompliance issues when they are not resolved in the project
• 
Escalate to senior management when noncompliance issues are not resolved in the 
project, so that appropriate actions can be taken
• 
Analyze noncompliance issues to see whether there are any formation trends 
regarding a particular category, so that appropriate action can be taken
• 
Ensure that you communicate the evaluation results to relevant stakeholders

Chapter 2 ■ CMMI Design
69
You will also want to establish and maintain records of the quality-assurance activities:
• 
Document the result and status of quality-assurance activities performed
• 
Revise the status of quality-assurance activities performed
Documents to be maintained include the following:
• 
Quality-assurance reports
• 
Status reports
Hopefully we have covered all the process areas and their mapping. Although space prohibits 
explaining every point in-depth, we hope you will find the material in this chapter easy-to-follow and 
simple-to-understand.
2.4  Summary
In this chapter, we have learned about the structure of the CMMI and how to interpret the structure. We have 
also covered 22 process areas. Most of the information and pointers in this chapter are taken from the CMMI 
model. The model information is very vast, but we have tried to explain purpose of various process areas in a 
simple, straightforward, and easy-to-understand manner.

CHAPTER 3
Planning CMMI Implementation
In this chapter, we will discuss CMMI implementation, with a special emphasis on how to initiate, plan, and 
start a CMMI implementation.
3.1  Initiating CMMI Implementation
Since you are now planning to initiate a CMMI implementation, you should ask yourself, “Do I need CMMI?”
As a first step, we need to understand what we want to achieve and deliver as part of our product 
development or service delivery. As for improving the process maturity, we need to consider what results are 
expected. It’s only by considering issues in this way that we can answer why we need CMMI.
If CMMI is not the solution for your problem, then you need to analyze what can work better for you 
and your organization. Many organizations want to implement CMMI to meet the project’s bidding criteria 
or perhaps because the client wants to work with only CMMI Appraised companies. To meet such scenarios, 
an organization will only get maturity level; however, it won’t be considered a matured organization in terms 
of its processes.
3.1.1  Understand Your Business
Here are few questions which could help you understand your business needs and move you towards the 
CMMI implementation:
• 
What products or services are offered by your organization?
• 
How many business units do you have, and do all of them produce the same or 
similar products/services?
• 
Have you identified key business units for you to succeed?
• 
Is there any scope for improvement? And which part of the business process do you 
want to improve?
• 
What is the current cycle time of your services or products?
• 
What is the current resource competency that you have?
• 
Are your clients expecting certain maturity in some processes?
Whenever you want to bring a vast change into your business process, or you want to introduce new 
process, it will always take some time as most people will have differences of opinion on how to proceed. 
Hence, an internal discussion within management and key decision makers about what CMMI is—and what 
kinds of benefits can be expected from implementing the model—will help reduce anxiety in the minds of 
stakeholders.

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
72
To start an implementation, organization and implementation teams can initially focus on one business 
unit and slowly move on to other business units. This is the option for those organizations that are not yet 
ready to cover the whole organization, and would prefer to start with one business unit at a time. This makes 
sense in a way because to include new process changes requires time and involvement; organizations see 
this is as a big challenge to implement while simultaneously delivering projects to their clients as part of 
running the business.
3.1.2  Engage CMMI Institute Partner
With the help of CMMI institute web site, you can easily find provider within your region. To search a 
provider, go to http://partners.cmmiinstitute.com/find-partner-organization/.
Next, select your partner of choice from the list or use the advanced search option to select the product 
suite, and then to select the geographic location for your search. Figure 3-1 shows the search screen from 
CMMI Institute web site.
You should discuss the following points with the consulting partner (these points must also be 
understood by the subject matter expert team members):
• 
The current version of CMMI model
• 
Implementation steps
• 
Experience in similar implementations
Figure 3-1.  The search screen to find a provider

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
73
• 
Goals and objectives to be achieved
• 
Resource requirements (e.g., human, infrastructure, and training requirements)
• 
The right constellation to be adopted
• 
You need to discuss how long it typically takes to
• 
You also need to discuss how long it typically takes to implement the CMMI model in 
an organization like yours, as well as the maturity level you should target.
■
■Note   We have to enroll authorized CMMI partners for the appraisal services; however, there are no such 
restrictions for consulting or SME services.
3.1.3  Choosing the Right Constellation
Choosing a constellation for implementing CMMI is important; choosing the right one for the business to 
benefit is more even important. (We have already covered constellations in Chapter 2). It’s also possible 
to take the advice of our consulting partner for choosing the right constellation. We also recommend 
examining a few factors when choosing a constellation:
• 
The business model in the organization
• 
The product delivery cycle time
• 
The complexities involved in product development
• 
Areas where more improvement is required
There could be additional factors that influence your decision. However, the best practice says that, 
when you have smaller cycle times with less intensive engineering needs to deliver the product or services, 
then it is recommended that you go for CMMI Services. However, if your business model delivers both 
product development and services (i.e., maintenance, migration, testing, etc.), then it is recommended that 
you go with combined CMMI Dev and CMMI Svc Constellations to implement the best from both. Please 
discuss these options your CMMI Partner.
However, if you are delivering projects with durations ranging from shorter (three to nine months) 
or longer projects (more than nine months), and it is expected that you maintain good process delivery 
practices, then it is recommended that you implement the CMMI Dev model.
■
■Tip   CMMI for Services (SVC) also contains engineering practices for the Service System Development 
process area.
3.1.4  Engaging a CMMI Institute Partner or Service Provider
We have already discussed that you need to engage a CMMI Institute partner (i.e., CMMI Institute Certified 
Individuals or consulting services provider) for performing the following:
• 
Official CMMI training
• 
Consulting/guidance in CMMI implementation
• 
Appraisal activity

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
74
CMMI implementation guidance can be carried out by SMEs available within the organization or a 
consulting partner hired from outside the organization; no certification is required for the SMEs to provide 
guidance or consultancy for any organization.
It is only if you want to achieve a maturity level rating for your organization processes that it becomes 
mandatory to use a CMMI Institute certified lead appraiser for performing the appraisal.
Lead appraiser services can be acquired through a CMMI Institute Partner. It is always a best practice 
to engage a lead appraiser early in your implementation if you have plan for CMMI Implementation with 
appraisal; doing so will help ensure the lead appraiser’s availability for the month in which your organization 
has decided to conduct CMMI appraisal. (A lead appraiser can perform only two appraisals in a month).
Selection of a Lead Appraiser is very important, and you must consider or list a few points before 
selecting a lead appraiser for your maturity ratings:
• 
Consider the overall experience of a lead appraiser
• 
Check the lead appraiser’s credibility in the IT industry
• 
Investigate past experience in conducting CMMI appraisals for organizations similar 
to your own
• 
Be sure to check the lead appraiser CMMI appraisal calendar, as sometimes you may 
not get lead appraiser dates for the month in which your organization is planning 
to conduct the final appraisal. There is a cap of two appraisals per month, so it is 
important to understand whether the lead appraiser is available for your desired 
timeframe.
These are also some of the generic points to consider before engaging any lead appraiser.
If an organization is only focusing on implementation of CMMI—and it neither wants to conduct an 
appraisal nor is looking for a process rating in the near future—then the services of a CMMI partner or lead 
appraiser won’t especially be needed.
■
■Note   A lead appraiser cannot be a consultant for you; and if you have your own lead appraiser in your 
organization, then that person can’t appraise your organization.
3.2  Identify and Form Teams
Once you are convinced and are ready for a CMMI implementation, the first thing you need to do is identify 
and form a subject matter expert team. The purpose of forming this team is to drive CMMI implementation 
within your organization across the business units.
This team’s existence is important as, during the implementation, there will be various stages where 
important decisions need to be made; and at that time, this team will have an important role to play in the 
areas they will be responsible for. You will learn more about this role later in this chapter and the book.
Who should be the part of subject matter expert team, and where do you find its members? Mostly, 
you find them in mid- to large-size organizations. Typically, it is the quality head from the SQA group 
(not testing) or the process quality group who drives the CMMI implementation, with the nod of Senior 
Management. But, if you don’t have this group currently running in your organization, then it is advisable 
that you hire the quality head and create the SQA group.
A quality head would have the required quality management system (QMS) formation and the 
management background. The CMMI model puts its emphasis mainly on improving organization QMS, 
which consists of your processes. The quality head/SQA group would act as an unbiased, independent, 
separate entity within the organization. This group will be a big help for the engineering/delivery teams 
in writing the processes because people from an engineering background are typically not fond of process 
writing—yes, that is a surprising fact.

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
75
■
■Note   The previously mentioned point about hiring and forming a quality head/SQA group is only advice. 
Organizations still can manage implementation without this group, as members from engineering/delivery 
teams could also play this role. The only difference is that members from the engineering/delivery teams have 
to put in more effort during the implementation exercise, along with their project delivery role.
Organizations which are small and are not very keen to form an SQA group, can contact any CMMI 
Partners in your region who are providing Consulting and Appraisal services. These partners will help and 
guide you in your CMMI implementation journey in every possible manner.
3.3  Decide Roles and Responsibilities
The quality head/group will drive and help in the identification and formation of teams, along with assigning 
their roles and responsibilities. It’s important to form the teams early because, once an organization takes 
the decision to implement CMMI, staff members have to be involved from various groups/departments/
business units. These staff members have to be chosen carefully for the implementation; hence, members 
with relevant experience and knowledge should be approached to form a team.
Also, the time availability of these staff members is a key factor during the implementation. We need 
to assess how much time they will be able to spend apart from their day-to-day project/product delivery 
tasks. This is important because CMMI implementation activities for an organization may take six to seven 
months until final appraisal on average; and for some organizations, this time period is very crucial because 
implementation is linked with the organization’s business objective to be achieved in a year or two. Hence, 
the time commitment from the key members is very important. If they are not available for any crucial 
project/product delivery or any other business reason, then the CMMI implementation activities/schedule 
might get delayed in completion.
Next, we’ll look at a typical team formation for a CMMI Implementation.
3.3.1  CMMI Program/Project Manager
As the name suggests, a CMMI program/project manager is responsible for monitoring and controlling the 
CMMI journey in your organization. Note that it is not mandatory to have full time person for this role. Any 
senior person within the organization can be dedicated or partially allocated for this role. Here are a few of 
this person’s responsibilities:
• 
CMMI program planning and monitoring
• 
Manages stakeholders’ commitment
• 
Status reporting to senior management
• 
Participates in SEPG meetings
• 
Helps in achieving plans
• 
Performs risk management
Looking at these responsibilities, you can see the similarities to the way a program manager manages 
products or services.

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
76
3.3.2  Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG)
A software engineering process group is a group of subject matter experts (SMEs) from an engineering or 
management background, along with process quality assurance members from within an organization. This 
group will be responsible for owning and running software process improvement activities.
A few of the SMEs can work as permanent members of the group, and others can work on an as needed 
basis. Here are some of the responsibilities played by the SEPG, which is sometimes called an Engineering 
Process Group (EPG):
• 
Ensures that relevant processes are defined and aligned with business objectives to 
support the delivery of product or services
• 
Ensures that process assets are revised and maintained on a regular basis, based on 
identified improvements
• 
Reviews and approves process tailoring
• 
Ensures that processes are appraised from time-to-time, in order to assess the 
strengths and weaknesses of current processes
If your organization aims to implement and achieve maturity level 4 and maturity level 5, then 
organizational performance management (OPM) also will be owned by SEPG.
3.3.3  PQA or SQA Group
A process quality assurance (PQA) or software quality assurance (SQA) group consists of people who have 
good knowledge of the process quality assurance or the software quality assurance.
■
■Note   PQA and SQA members are not part of the software testing group; as per CMMI, QA is part of testing 
and peer reviews, which is called verification and is performed by the project team. QC is done at the client end, 
which is validation.
The typical responsibilities of this group include, but are not limited to, the following:
• 
Project reviews/audits
• 
Deliver process trainings
• 
Product and process quality reviews
• 
Process compliance checks
• 
Project metrics collation and analysis
• 
Providing relevant process improvement updates to SEPG
3.3.4  Metrics Analyst Group
The metrics analyst group is a subgroup of the SEPG group. These are SMEs who collect and analyze/
understand project metrics data. The analysis of project metrics data needs to be meaningful for the project 
and organization to use it for informed decision making.
This group generally does not exist in most of organizations, and some organizations combine their 
project management office with metrics group.

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
77
Typical responsibilities of the metrics analyst group include the following:
• 
Metrics data collection from projects on a monthly basis
• 
Perform metrics analysis
• 
Use analysis to identify and baseline new metrics
3.3.5  Training Group
The training group in an organization can work as the separate/independent group, or it can work in 
combination with the Human Resource (HR) group. This group’s main role is to do the following:
• 
Identify the training needs in the organization
• 
Plan and conduct Trainings
• 
Assess training effectiveness
• 
Improve the training delivery process
So far, we’ve covered the composition of teams and their formation with a clear understanding of their 
roles and responsibilities. Now it’s to schedule the CMMI Implementation activities.
If you think from the perspective of a program manager or project manager, you know the value of effort 
estimation. Each task involved in the program should be estimated, and you should be able to schedule 
activities that fit within your target.
Hence, you need to be clear that it is not only a project for your organization, but that it is also for 
cultural change within your organization, which may take some time to show the results.
If you or senior management decides to implement CMMI practices within your organization, then 
please do check and assess whether you have sufficient time available to achieve the target.
3.4  Plan CMMI Implementation and Activities
Before we move ahead to planning phase of CMMI, we should draw our attention to some of the common 
reasons which could make our CMMI Implementation ineffective.
The reasons for an ineffective implementation might include the following:
• 
No participation from management
• 
CMMI Implementation only for the client needs
• 
Lack of project management skills
• 
Resistance to change
• 
No process improvement expectation setting
The SME team has to note the first important step is to plan and conduct the gap analysis with respect 
to the current method/process/practice followed for product and/or service delivery. This means it is 
necessary to know and understand where the gaps are before we start filling them; in other words, we must 
know the right areas that need focus and improvement. Identifying more gaps during the gap analysis 
exercises will help us make the organization processes more robust.
This would help in planning the activities, creating timelines, estimating resources, and devising 
strategies for effective implementation of CMMI. Hence, gap analysis is the first recommended step in 
planning.

3.4.1  Process Gap Analysis
By definition, gap analysis is the process of comparing the actual performance with the potential or desired 
performance. Gap analysis is the formal study of what a business is currently doing and how its processes are 
defined and followed; and then determining whether these processes are helping the organization to reach 
the goals it wants to achieve in the future. Gap analysis can be done from different perspectives, such as 
resource availability, business processes, and information technology.
Performing gap analysis involves studying artifacts and interviewing or discussing these issues with the 
practitioners. These interviews are mostly conducted with the project manager and the program manager 
who are involved in the service/delivery of products/project.
3.4.2  How Gap Analysis Is Conducted
Let examine how gap analysis is conducted.
Gap analysis will be performed with the CMMI partner selected by you for CMMI implementation and 
appraisal services.
A CMMI partner cum external consultant will review the plan and meet the teams that we have 
discussed creating so far in this chapter.
It’s possible that certain teams won’t yet exist at the time of scheduling the process gap analysis (e.g., the 
SEPG group or Metrics Analyst Group might not exist yet), and this can be assumed to be part of the known 
gap. Obviously, interviewing non-existent teams during the gap analysis exercises is not possible.
During the gap analysis, the external consultant will interview people from the following existing teams:
• 
Project/Program delivery managers
• 
SEPG/Metrics Analyst Group
• 
SQA/Quality Group
• 
Training Group
The external consultant will also review the existing processes/artifacts:
• 
He will review processes for project management, engineering, and support
• 
He will review artifacts created as part of the project, such as the project plan, the 
requirement document, the design, and so on
The consultant’s basis for interviewing and reviewing processes/artifacts is the CMMI Dev model, 
including the following components in particular:
Process areas
Generic goals
Generic practices
Specific goals
Specific practices
If any gap is noted/reported by the external consultant, it means that either one or more of the 
previously mentioned CMMI components are not satisfied.
This is where the GAP analysis is handy. You might be thinking about the current situation and the 
future state that you want your organization to reach, along with the task or tasks that need to be completed 
to close the gap.

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
79
While performing the gap analysis, a gap report (draft) is prepared for each process area. The draft 
report contains all the weakness within the organization. This draft is first presented to the management and 
key stakeholders. After their discussion, a final report will be prepared.
Figure 3-2 shows a sample gap report format with one process area: Project Planning (PP)
3.4.3  Plan and Close Identified/Reported Gaps
The next step is to analyze the gaps against the CMMI model, and then plan how to close the gaps within a 
timeline agreed upon by the management/key stakeholders. Note that this is also the time to plan or develop 
strategies for bringing the required cultural change to the organization. Cultural change is significant 
because, when closing the gaps, new paths and possibilities can emerge which we might have to adopt for 
the product and/or service delivery.
Based on the gaps reported, your organization can undertake the following steps:
• 
Determine the effort required to close all the reported gaps
• 
Assign individuals or teams to each gap to close
• 
Process gaps and update
• 
Update roles and responsibilities
• 
Target projects under CMMI implementation
• 
Update the organization’s structure
• 
Assess the training needs for the teams
Based on the established plan, your organization can also do the following:
• 
Define the business goals and objectives
• 
Decide CMMI representation
• 
Decide on the maturity level to be achieved (e.g., Level 2 or Level 3)
• 
Decide on the timeline to achieve the targeted maturity level, business performance, 
and so on
• 
Track the plan/timeline for closing the gaps, as well as to achieve the targeted 
maturity level
■
■Tip   Always be careful with the timeline you have selected to achieve your goal. Both relaxed and very 
aggressive timelines can affect quality of your implementation.
Figure 3-2.  A sample gap report format

Chapter 3 ■ Planning CMMI Implementation
80
In terms of the CMMI implementation timeline, it is recommended that you be a little aggressive. One 
important point to note here is that you cannot skip any maturity level in between, which means you need to 
implement all the process areas belonging to a lower ML (maturity level). It is always recommended by the 
experts that you achieve ML3 before you move to ML4 and ML5.
Please remember that maturity level is not a rank, but rather the actual level of maturity for your 
organization. If we really want to benefit from CMMI Appraisal as an organization, then we need to 
perform at certain level with consistency. However, achieving a higher maturity level depends upon the 
organization’s strength and willingness to do so.
■
■Caution   If your process has a lot of gaps, then don’t go to ML4 and ML5 directly because doing so could 
cause negative consequences and harm employee morale.
3.5  Summary
In this chapter, we learned about the steps to be taken to initiate the CMMI implementation, as well as 
points and questions we need to think about while initiating the implementation. We also learned how to 
identify and engage a CMMI partner, which groups and team formations would be needed, how process gap 
analysis is planned and conducted, and how to execute a plan for closing existing gaps.

CHAPTER 4
Creating, Updating, and Releasing 
a QMS
In this chapter, we will discuss creating, updating, and releasing a Quality Management System (QMS). We 
will also learn which teams the QMS is created for. For some, not only might QMS represent a new word, 
but its purpose might be unfamiliar, as well. If that’s the case for you, it is recommended that you read 
about QMS from a CMMI appraisal perspective (see Chapter 6) because that will make it much easier to 
understand in the context of this chapter.
QMS is the combination of the policies, processes, templates, checklists, and guidelines which are used 
on a daily basis by employees or staff to create the software products/applications delivered.
4.1  Who Is QMS for?
To create the QMS for our employees and organization, we need to assess all the teams for which processes 
are needed. In fact, we have to create this for all the teams that are involved in delivering the software 
product or application.
A question could come to mind here: “Who will create the QMS?”
In earlier chapters, we discussed the SEPG and SQA/quality groups that will drive the process initiative 
cum compliance as a team in the organization.
Ownership of QMS resides with SEPG group to create, update, and release QMS to all the employees/staff.
Another question that might come to mind is this: “When does the SEPG group initiate the creation of 
the QMS?”
The answer is simple. It does so before we start building the software products or applications.
Also, the act of creating new processes or updating existing processes is initiated when an organization 
wants to implement CMMI practices. (This was discussed in Chapter 4 in the gap analysis exercise, where 
existing processes were reviewed against the CMMI model. After gap analysis, we come to know about the 
processes which are required to be created, both new ones and some existing ones that need to be updated 
or modified.)
Here’s the most important point about QMS: all the processes must suit the need of your delivery and 
support teams, or else these processes won’t be used and the expected results won’t be achieved.
Hence, the SEPG team’s main responsibility is to always identify the opportunities which could be 
analyzed to improve our processes.
Let’s examine what goes into creating a QMS.
As stated in the model, we have to establish the organization’s quality goals and objectives.
These quality goals and objectives set the organization’s business objectives. For example, one goal is to 
provide on-time delivery of our software product/application to our clients.
Hence, as per the model, we need to define goals and objectives for the following teams:

Chapter 4 ■ Creating, Updating, and Releasing a QMS
82
• 
Software development
• 
Software maintenance
• 
Software engineering process group (SEPG),
• 
Quality Group
• 
Training Group
However, organizations can have goals and objectives for their other teams/groups which are 
supporting or involved in the software product/application delivery.
So, who initiates the goals/objectives exercise, and who are all the parties involved in creating it?
The SEPG group has to initiate this important exercise with senior management first, so it can identify 
the key goals that management/leadership team wants to set for the business, delivery, and support teams.
This exercise with the senior management is called a goal question metric (GQM). It helps to identify the 
business goals and objectives.
4.2  Interpreting a Goal Question Metric
If we have a goal for delivering on time or improving the delivery time, then we may need to ask the 
question, “What needs to be done or achieved to deliver on time?”
Once the way to achieve the goal has been identified, we need to link it with a metric to measure and 
assess goal accomplishment (see Figure 4-1).
Goals would be communicated by senior management for software delivery/ engineering teams, SEPG, 
and the quality and training groups.
Once the goals/business objectives are communicated, the SEPG team shall help in defining the 
associated metrics/measures to achieve them. The SEPG team shall hold a meeting with the delivery and 
functional team heads to discuss the required metrics/measures, their unit of measurement, data source, 
computation formula, frequency of data collection, and so on (see Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-1.  A snapshot of a sample GQM

Chapter 4 ■ Creating, Updating, and Releasing a QMS
83
■
■Note   In the Target Range column, Min Value and Max Value have to be derived from past projects’ 
performance data in order to determine the Measure for Schedule Variance.
If performance data for past projects is not available or the organization has just started its operations, 
then the organization can analyze available industry standards/benchmarks for their identified measures.
If an organization cannot find suitable standards, then it can define or set its own target range for each 
metric/measure to start with. After a period of time based on the observed performance, Target Range (Min 
Value and Max Value) could be updated or improved.
Business objectives and associated metrics/measures may vary from organization to organization. Hence, 
each organization can define its objectives/measures based on its needs (see Figures 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5).
Figure 4-2.  A snapshot of a delivery team (sample) business objective with metrics
Figure 4-3.  A snapshot of the SEPG team (sample) business objective with an associated Measure

Chapter 4 ■ Creating, Updating, and Releasing a QMS
84
By following the preceding sample snapshots of business objectives and measures, an organization  
(or its teams) can define its own relevant objectives and associated metrics/measures.
4.3  Creating Policies and Processes
We need to initiate the creation of policies and processes (e.g., procedures and SOPs). Once the GQM, 
business objectives, and metrics/measures exercise is done, the SEPG team will focus on the creation of 
policies and processes. (As pointed out in the earlier chapters, the SEPG and quality teams will drive the 
creation of QMS (i.e., its policies, processes, templates, checklists, guidelines, etc.—some organizations 
combined their SEPG and SQA teams).
As per the CMMI, the policies of each process are important. Hence, first policies shall be created, as 
these policies help organizations seek the required commitment from the employees/staff to follow the 
process approach in executing project/product delivery tasks (see Figure 4-6).
Figure 4-4.  A snapshot of the quality/SQA team (sample) business objective with an associated Measure
Figure 4-5.  A snapshot of the training team (sample) business objective with an associated Measure

Chapter 4 ■ Creating, Updating, and Releasing a QMS
85
If an organization has planned for a CMMI level 3 implementation, then policies have to be created for 
all 18 process areas. If an organization has planned for a high maturity CMMI level 5 implementation, then 
policies have to be created for all 22 process areas.
In the preceding snapshot, the following columns are covered:
• 
CMMI process areas, as per the CMMI model
• 
A QMS process name, which is given to the process that will be followed by the 
organization
Also, note that serial no. 1 includes three process areas in the “CMMI Process areas” column; however, 
the “QMS process name” column has only one process mentioned. This is because the project management 
process is defined by referring to the three process areas.
Hence, it is not necessary that we also create 18 (level 3) or 22 (level 5) process areas. We can group two 
or three CMMI process areas into one process.
Now let’s look at the processes which we need to create as part of the QMS based on the CMMI model 
(see Table 4-1).

4.4  Creating Templates, Checklists, and Guidelines
For each QMS process, there will be associated templates, checklists, and guidelines which need to be 
created. Table 4-2 covers some sample items for a QMS implementation.

4.5  Updating QMS and Release QMS 
In the preceding section, we learned, as part of the QMS, which processes, templates, checklists, and 
guidelines need to be created. In this section, we will learn about updating and releasing the QMS.
You might wonder whether it is important to know when the QMS gets updated, or why the need arises 
to update it.
4.5.1  The First Update
Before CMMI implementation, every organization always has some of the processes which it follows to 
deliver its software products or applications; however, when an organization decides to implement CMMI 
model/practices, the QMS gets updated in a full-grown manner.
4.5.2  The Second Update
Once the QMS is functional and processes, templates, checklists, and guidelines are in use by the staff/
employees, there are always going to be improvement requests which will be reported by the staff for SEPG 
analysis. This is because it is only by using the processes that we can judge whether the processes created 
are useful and adding value. These improvements could be small or big in nature. For example, even a very 
small change required in one template or one checkpoint needs to be added in a checklist. In other words, 
it may lead to changes in current processes, templates, checklists, and guidelines, or it may be required to 
create the new ones.
After analyzing all of the received process improvement requests, the SEPG team will work on them and 
eventually update the QMS. It is an important exercise, and it may require a lot of effort by the SEPG team 
and other staff members who get the opportunity to work on the QMS update. As a result, the organization/
staff receives the improved processes, templates, guidelines, and checklists.
4.6  Releasing the QMS
Once the work is done on updating the QMS, the time arrives to release the update version to the 
employees/staff.
The QMS release is done in a planned manner by the SEPG team, with the help of the SQA team. Some 
processes which are updated or created new get piloted before their release because it is important to know 
whether or not they will work. This prevents a lot of defect generation, so the defects are never passed into 
the system. This also saves lot of effort and rework in correcting such defects.
To communicate about the impending QMS release, the SEPG shall update one QMS release form. This 
form will contain information about what has changed from the previous version of QMS, as well as what has 
been added to the new version of the QMS. For example, the previous version of the requirement process 
was v1.0; after the update, v1.1 will be released. The same applies for templates, checklists, and guidelines.
The SEPG has to communicate to all the employees/staff about the QMS release, even if only a 
few members/staff had shared the process improvement request. This will ensure that everyone in the 
organization is aware of how to use and follow the new processes, templates, checklists, or guidelines.
4.7  Summary
In this chapter, we learned about creating, updating, and releasing a QMS. Along the way, we also learned 
what will become part of the QMS as per the CMMI model, as well as which departments the QMS is created 
for. Finally, we learned when the QMS gets updated and what goes into the QMS release.

CHAPTER 5
Implement QMS
In previous chapters, we have covered policies, processes, templates, guidelines, checklists, and other 
standards to be used for the various groups and departments based on CMMI levels. In this chapter, we will 
learn how to implement QMS for each department and group, as well as how to use different artifacts in our 
day-to-day activities. Let’s start with how to plan a QMS training.
5.1  Plan QMS Training
We already have a QMS ready; now it’s time to guide and train the employees/group on how to use it.
Once the QMS is released to everyone in the organization or the business unit teams, it becomes 
essential to provide process training to the delivery and support functions (i.e., to SEPG, QA, and training).
Hence, SEPG team has to plan process training with the help of the training team members. If your IT 
group or business unit targeted for CMMI implementation is big, then you should plan to implement the 
process training in multiple batches, as it would be difficult for everyone to attend the training on the same 
day. Hence, it also makes sense to deliver the process training in small batches.
In the process training, the trainer needs to explain to the teams how an employee can use and execute 
the process steps, including the associated artifacts they would need to create.
■
■Note   The trainer for these process trainings should be the person from SEPG or the person who has 
written that particular process, as it will help the employees to understand it better.
5.2  Create and Update Project and Department Artifacts
Once the training is imparted to the delivery teams, the next step would be to convert the entire QMS 
templates into the usable project artifacts. All the project managers from different projects would have to 
start the documentation activities in their respective projects.
Let’s look at which artifacts are required to be prepared by the project manager, the team members, and 
the SEPG/SQA/training functions.
The project manager documentation list includes the following:
• 
Integrated Project Plan
• 
Estimation
• 
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
• 
Risk & Issue Log

• 
Training Attendance Records
• 
Training Feedback Records
•

• 
Training Metrics

Chapter 5 ■ Implement QMS
93
The SEPG team needs to include the following documentation:
• 
SEPG Plan
• 
Process Improvement Tracker
• 
Process Improvement filled forms
• 
Process tailoring guidelines
• 
Process tailoring requests/records
• 
QMS release notes
• 
QMS Master list (for tracking of all the processes, templates, checklists, and 
guidelines)
• 
Knowledge repository (historical documents from the projects)
■
■Note   The preceding lists are not the complete, but it is advisable that you create all of the artifacts  
listed in them.
As a part of the project management plan, it is the responsibility of the project manager to keep all of 
the artifacts updated; the SEPG has to ensure that these are followed and institutionalized.
5.3  Conduct Implementation Reviews/Audits
Along with documentation exercise, the SEPG will have to plan and conduct the implementation reviews 
with the help of the quality/audit team. Implementation reviews will ensure that the documentation is 
compliant as per the CMMI model practices.
It is advisable to plan the implementation reviews during the creation of the documents; this helps the 
review quality team guide the documentation owners in an easy way. It also helps them to understand the 
process in an efficient manner.
5.3.1  Conduct Audits
After implementation reviews, the organization/SEPG team needs to plan internal audits to be compliant 
with the CMMI model. To conduct the internal process quality audits, the organization can opt to use its 
internal auditors/SMEs, or it can hire an external auditor cum consultant.
One must understand the meaning of the terms internal and external. The term internal indicates 
that the internal auditor can be any employee of the organization who has knowledge of the CMMI 
model, understands the project delivery, and can guide project team for implementation. Also, an auditor 
must have sufficient skills for metrics data calculation, as well as the ability to understand and audit the 
measurement activities in the project.
Audits will help in sharing the documentation gaps, and it will help the project/delivery teams to close 
the gaps in an easy and efficient manner.
■
■Note   The CMMI auditor must have taken the official CMMI Intro Training, so that he/she can have complete 
understanding of the CMMI model. He/she should also know how to implement the required process areas and 
Specific Practices.

Chapter 5 ■ Implement QMS
94
5.3.2  Maintain Project Documentation
After implementation reviews and internal audits, the project/support functions have to maintain the 
created documentation in their respective areas. And once the spot check by the external consultant is 
planned, the created documentation can be verified.
5.4  Create and Update the Knowledge Repository
The CMMI model helps us to create a knowledge repository in the organization; it is the responsibility of 
the SEPG group to take the initiative for creating this repository, which is also referred to as the Process 
Asset Library (PAL) in the CMMI model. This repository will be available centrally to all in the organization, 
although they will have different access rights.
In the knowledge repository, we can have both product and process artifacts for reference purposes. 
The purpose of this repository is to provide help to the delivery and support functions, so they can use 
historical documents which can act as a guide cum help.
For example, a project manager during the project planning phase in a new project can refer to the 
historical project plan. This might include estimates which will help in providing the useful information to 
the team; by referring to these documents, the team can avoid any risks which might have occurred in the 
past projects.
Also, if a code repository is available, then the project manager and the delivery team can analyze and 
use some of the available reusable code, which will help them to reduce their work and to improve their 
overall delivery timelines.
A knowledge repository typically will include the following artifacts:
• 
Project Plan document
• 
Estimation records
• 
Past risks list
• 
Past issues list
• 
DAR records
• 
Reusable source code
• 
A lessons learned list based on past projects
• 
Defects list
■
■Note   The SEPG team is responsible for updating the knowledge repository, but it is the responsibility of 
every member in the organization to contribute back to the repository.
5.5  Summary
In this chapter, we talked about the implementation of a QMS and how to train the employees/team to 
follow the new practices. We also discussed the project and support function artifacts that would be updated 
from time-to-time. This chapter also covered when to conduct the implementation reviews and internal 
quality audits within an organization, as well as the importance of this process. Finally, the chapter covered 
the need to maintain a knowledge repository and how to use it.

CHAPTER 6
Plan for CMMI Appraisal
In this chapter, we will cover how to plan and organize a CMMI appraisal for your group or organization, 
how to prepare and guide your teams for final CMMI appraisal, and how final appraisal activities are 
conducted. By the end of this chapter, we will have touched on most of the things which are required to plan 
for a successful CMMI Implementation. Specifically, this chapter will cover the following points:
• 
Identify the objective, constraints, and scope of an Appraisal
• 
Identify/develop an appraisal plan
• 
Prepare and train the team on appraisal methods
• 
Plan and prepare for appraisal conduct
Let’s start with the first point of planning for a CMMI appraisal.
6.1  Identify the Objectives, Constraints, and Scope of an 
Appraisal
For most readers, this point is more like a generic practice. Whenever any project gets started, the first task is 
to analyze the requirements, and after that, to identify the objectives and scope.
6.1.1  Analyze the Requirements
For CMMI or any other appraisals, analyzing the requirements can be the most important process because it 
can be the foundation of success or failure for the complete appraisal. Most appraisal downfalls are due to a 
lack of requirements gathering.
From a CMMI perspective, the purpose is to understand the business needs of the organization for 
which the appraisal need to be conducted. The appraisal team leader of the lead appraiser (LA) will collect 
information and help the business head, unit head, or sometimes, the sponsor.
Various tools and techniques can be used for analyzing the requirements, such as interviewing the 
sponsor to get the needed information. A formal consultation is very important; sometimes, a series of 
meetings need to be conducted with the stakeholders for their consensus on the business needs, which can 
be done using a SCAMPI A appraisal.

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
96
6.1.2  Identify the Appraisal Objectives
With the series of meetings conducted, the business needs have been identified. In general, CMMI is 
requested when the organization or the business unit wants to accelerate its process improvement, which 
includes one or more of these parameters:
• 
Improving quality
• 
Reducing efforts and/or cost
• 
Decreasing time to market
There can be a variety of reasons for an organization to conduct a CMMI appraisal. For example, it can 
be driven by business objectives like the following:
• 
Documenting the benchmark that reflects business process improvements
• 
Identifying the potential risk areas of an organization which may impact the 
performance of an organization
• 
Supporting scientific decision making based on data and analytics
• 
Identifying the strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) of the 
organization or business unit
As per the CMMI handbook, the appraisal team leader will ensure the following:
• 
The sponsor and relevant stakeholders are identified
• 
The business objectives have been documented (these will be provided by the 
sponsor)
• 
Whether the appraisal objectives have been aligned with the business objectives
• 
The appraisal usage mode has been identified (i.e., internal process improvement, 
supplier selection, or process monitoring)
■
■Note   It is very important to schedule one meeting/discussion between the appraisal team leader and the 
CMMI sponsor (within the organization).
6.1.3  Identify Appraisal Constraints
The constraints can also be determined by scheduling the discussion between the lead appraiser and 
the sponsor and/or business head. The business/unit head must communicate whether there are any 
limitations which require negotiation with the lead appraiser.
Some constraints, like cost and schedules, can be identified at early stages of the appraisal, which are at 
a high level only. Examples of some basic constraints include the following:
• 
We need this Appraisal to be done in Q3 or Q2.
• 
You cannot use more than ten people on the team.
• 
Management review can be done only via a video conference, teleconference, or 
through similar technology.

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
97
6.1.4  Determining Appraisal Scope
The scope of the appraisal consists of the appraisal reference model (i.e., CMMI DEV, CMMI Services, or 
CMMI Acquisition) and the scope of the organization/unit that would be assessed during the appraisal.
The organization must ensure that the scope of the reference model is determined and documented 
early in the planning process. It can do so by using the staged representation or the continuous 
representation.
When we say organizational unit, we are referring to a subgroup within the organization for which 
appraisal activities will be carried out.
■
■Note   An organization may include the whole organization or a business unit (it could be small or big) 
within the organization, or it may select only a few development projects for the CMMI implementation and 
appraisal/ratings.
As per the CMMI handbook, the following are the required practices for identifying the scope of the 
appraisal. The lead appraiser, along with the appraisal sponsor and/or the business/unit head, shall do the 
following:
• 
Identify the scope of reference model and representation that will be used for the 
appraisal
• 
Identify the organizational unit and scope to be assessed
• 
Identify team members who will participate in the appraisal
In the appraisal scope, we have to identify sample projects which could be assessed, as well as 
the support functions (i.e., SEPG, QA, and training). In the project scope, we must also include the 
organizational unit size (i.e., the total number of people currently working within the organizational unit and 
the total projects which are currently active).
As per the CMMI handbook, the sample projects and support functions have to showcase the following 
during the appraisal:
• 
Primary projects: Objective evidence for each process area under the scope of 
appraisal
• 
Secondary projects: Objective evidence for one or more process areas under the 
scope of appraisal
• 
Support functions: Objective evidence for practices under the scope of appraisal
6.2  Develop Appraisal Plan
Like any other plan, the appraisal plan is very important. It will act as a guide for the execution of appraisal 
activities. The lead appraiser will document the appraisal plan will share his/her review with the sponsor. A 
tool for developing the appraisal plan could be an appraisal plan template.
An appraisal plan may include the following appraisal planning activities:
• 
Tailoring method
• 
Resources required
• 
Cost and schedule

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
98
• 
Logistics
• 
Risks
• 
Appraisal plan commitment
Let’s drill down in detail on each activity required for the development of an appraisal plan, beginning 
with the tailoring method.
6.2.1  The Tailoring Method
In concert with SCAMPI A, some of the tailoring which could be allowed is as follows:
• 
Depending upon the choices, there could be options within the required practices
• 
Parameters could be allowed to vary within the limits
• 
The SAM (Supplier Agreement Management) process area is optional, and it can 
be mentioned as out of scope for the organization or the business unit going for an 
appraisal
For SCAMPI A, the tailoring activities should be performed carefully because what should be tailored 
or made out of scope as per the model is very important for the business unit to be appraised. For example, 
consider a case where an organization wants the SAM process area to be out of scope for the appraisal as 
currently there is no outsourcing work, but the company’s senior management has been in discussions to 
outsource some of its work to vendors in the near future (i.e., the SAM process area). If the CMMI team is not 
aware of this update from management, then there is a chance that the team will make the wrong tailoring 
selection. To avoid such scenarios, the CMMI team should be in constant touch with its senior management 
before making any decisions for the appraisal activity.
The CMMI guidelines expect the lead appraiser to do the following:
• 
Perform a review of each activity and select tailoring options accordingly
• 
Ensure that the tailoring decisions taken are appropriate to meet the appraisal 
objectives and constraints
• 
Ensure that the decisions made for making particular tailoring options are 
documented
■
■Note   An organization must ensure that selected method tailorings and their implementation do not violate 
SCAMPI A Required Practices.
6.2.2  Identify Needed Resources
When conducting the appraisal, identify and estimate the resources required. Resource categories to keep in 
mind for the appraisal include human resources, infrastructure facilities, tools, and so on.
We have to ensure these resources are accounted for in advance because this will help the appraisal 
activities run more smoothly.

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
99
As per the CMMI guidelines, the lead appraiser will do the following:
• 
Ensure that the appraisal team members are identified by the business unit which 
needs to be appraised, as these appraisal team members need to participate in 
the final appraisal with the lead appraiser. These members should have sufficient 
experience in project management and engineering (i.e., SDLC)
• 
Ensure that the participants (i.e., functional area representatives (FAR)) from various 
project teams are identified by the business unit; FAR areas include requirements, 
design, coding and unit testing, and integration and testing
• 
Ensure that equipment and facilities have been arranged by the business unit
• 
Ensure that resource decisions are documented in the appraisal plan
■
■Note   If appraisal team members (ATMs) are not available for the SCAMPI A appraisal from within 
the organization, then, as per CMMI guidelines, the business unit is allowed to hire ATMs from outside the 
organization for the appraisal duration.
Also, during the appraisal planning, it’s important to identify the projects to be appraised, along with 
names of the people who are going to participate as team members in the appraisal.
You also need to identify the seating capacity and environment of the rooms which will be used by the 
teams for conducting the appraisal activities. Please be aware that resource planning is not limited to the 
personnel only; it is also includes a projector, laptop, or video-conferencing equipment (for any teams or 
senior members who are not present when the business unit is to be appraised).
6.2.3  Determine the Cost and Schedule
After estimating the resource requirements, you need to estimate the cost and schedule; as per the CMMI 
guidelines, there are required practices for estimating the cost and schedule. The lead appraiser will do the 
following:
• 
Estimate key appraisal events for the required duration in order to form a detailed 
schedule
• 
Estimates the effort of participating members in the appraisal
• 
Estimates the cost for using the business unit facilities and equipment, as 
appropriate
• 
Estimate the cost for any travel, lodging, and meals, as required at the time of 
appraisal
• 
Document the detailed appraisal plan
6.2.4  Manage Logistics
The next step is to manage the logistical plan which must take in the details and should be documented. 
The team leader must document logistical schedule and dependencies if any. They must maintain the 
communication channel for providing status and assign responsibilities to track logistical issues.

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
100
To make the logistical planning more effective, you must plan for the following details:
• 
Hotels or guest houses for the members and lead appraiser, if travel is required to 
perform the appraisal at different locations or even outside the country
• 
Any workstation support
• 
The arrangement of food and beverages
• 
Good Internet connections and other accessible equipment that might be required 
during the appraisal
6.2.5  Document and Manage Risk
As with any other project risks, it is very important to plan and manage risks proactively for the CMMI 
appraisal. The lead appraiser will document the identified risks and associated mitigation plans. The lead 
appraiser will also communicate these risks and their associated mitigation plans to the CMMI sponsor, 
CMMI team leader, and the ATMs.
6.2.5.1  Obtain Commitments to the Appraisal Plan
This is the final step for developing an appraisal plan, where the formal commitment is obtained from the 
sponsor. The appraisal plan constitutes an agreement between sponsor and the lead appraiser.
The lead appraiser will do the following:
• 
Ensure that the appraisal plan is reviewed with the sponsor and that the sponsor’s 
approval is secured
• 
Ensure that the appraisal plan is also reviewed with the relevant stakeholders for 
their review and acceptance
The lead appraiser and the sponsor have to sign the appraisal plan to secure the commitment towards 
the plan.
6.3  Prepare and Train the Team on Appraisal Methods
Once the appraisal plan is prepared and the commitment is obtained from the sponsor, it’s time to ensure 
that an experienced and qualified team is ready to execute the appraisal process.
Approximately one month before the scheduled appraisal date, the lead appraiser will conduct the 
mandatory four day training session for the ATMs. Of the four total days, the CMMI intro session will be 
conducted for the first three days; and on the last day, the ATMs will be taught how to conduct the appraisal. 
This will help the ATMs to be clear on the concepts of CMMI, so that they will be ready to help the lead 
appraiser.
Every lead appraiser’s teaching style is different; hence, ATM members can undergo a somewhat 
different appraisal experience if they get the chance to participate in more than one appraisal. However, if 
the lead appraiser is the same during the second CMMI appraisal, then the ATMs will have to wait for a new 
lead appraiser.

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
101
■
■Note   For some ATM members, it could be their second CMMI appraisal; in such a scenario, they don’t 
need to attend the CMMI intro training again; instead, they need to attend only the one day training on how to 
conduct the appraisal, as attendance on this day is mandated by the CMMI Institute. There is one catch here, 
however; this scenario won’t work if the version of CMMI model has changed since the last time that ATM 
member underwent the intro training.
6.4  Plan and Prepare for Appraisal Conduct
Here, the motive is to ensure readiness for conducting the appraisal. This readiness includes the availability 
of filled PIIDs which show the mapping of the CMMI model practices against the objective evidence from 
projects and support functions, as well as the availability of appraisal team members, updated risk status, 
and the associated mitigation plans.
Upon assessment, the sponsor and the lead appraiser will decide whether the appraisal plan will be 
executed as defined or need to be re-planned. They will also have to decide whether any corrective actions 
need to be taken against the plan to ensure that the plan is successfully achieved.
The lead appraiser will perform the following steps to check the readiness of the appraisal:
• 
Check the availability of objective evidence for each practice in the process area, as 
per the defined appraisal scope
• 
Ascertain the readiness of ATMs to conduct the appraisal
• 
Determine the availability and readiness of all the logistics (i.e., the infrastructure 
facilities, equipment, etc.)
• 
Review the status of appraisal risks and their impact
■
■Note   The readiness review can be assessed on-site, off-site, by video- or teleconference, or in a combined 
manner.
There will always be more than one readiness review, as there could be leftover gaps which the teams 
will need to work on and close.
6.5  Conduct the Final Appraisal
On the first day of the final appraisal, the opening meeting will be held in which the lead appraiser will 
present the appraisal plan to all the teams and the sponsor. Also, the lead appraiser will cover how the 
appraisal plan will be executed and the activities which are planned each day (i.e., documents review, 
interviews with different teams, etc.).
After the opening meeting, the lead appraiser will review the documents with the appraisal team 
members. Once this exercise is finished, the interview sessions will start the next day; usually, these sessions 
start with the project management interview, followed by the project team members, including the SEPG, 
QA, training, and management members (i.e., it could include the program manager).
Once all the interviews are finished, the lead appraiser will, along with the appraisal team members, 
consolidate the findings and assess whether there are any weakness/improvement points against any 
practice.

Chapter 6 ■ Plan for CMMI Appraisal
102
During this exercise, if there are any queries to be asked of a project manager or any other team 
member who has already been interviewed, then that person can be called back to the interview room 
for clarification. For example, during the interview session, a project manager might communicate that 
status reports are being shared with the program manager, but the objective evidence provided to the lead 
appraiser and appraisal members does not support this assertion. In this scenario, the project manager 
would be called again to show some evidences that the status reports have been communicated to the 
management. If evidence is available, then no weakness would be reported; however, there is a possibility 
that the improvement suggestion could be noted.
After all the evidence collection, interview sessions, and clarifications, the lead appraiser and appraisal 
team members will start rating each process area, specific goals, and/or generic goals.
If all the specific and generic goals are fully or largely implemented and satisfied, then only the overall 
organizational unit would be rated as satisfied. Once all the process areas have been rated, then the next step 
would be to prepare the findings presentation. All appraisal members will prepare their findings/slides, and 
these will be reviewed with the lead appraiser.
Once the slides are reviewed, they will be merged together to form the preliminary findings. These 
findings will be presented first to all the team members who were interviewed, so as to ensure that any 
finding which is noted is not incorrect.
After the preliminary findings session on the last day, the final findings presentation is done for all of the 
organizational unit and team members who participated. The findings are comprised of both strengths and 
weaknesses. Strengths document things we have to carry forward in the future, and weaknesses document 
areas we need to look at.
When all the findings are presented, the final slide will tell you the result, whether you are successfully 
appraised for CMMI Level 3 or CMMI Level 5, as per the appraisal scope.
6.6  Summary
In this chapter, we covered planning for identifying the scope, constraints, and objectives of the appraisal. 
We have also covered how to develop the appraisal plan, and clarified the roles and responsibilities of the 
appraisal team leader and the lead appraiser. This chapter also discussed how to prepare and plan for the 
appraisal.

CHAPTER 7
Focus on Continual Improvement
After the CMMI appraisal, our focus should not deviate from continual improvement. In this chapter, 
therefore, we will focus on how to achieve this principle. If the focus deviates from this, then the whole 
purpose of the CMMI implementation will be lost. Let’s begin by breaking down what the term continual 
improvement means.
7.1  Continual Improvement
In a CMMI context, the continual improvement objective is to keep enhancing the QMS, including the 
processes, templates, guidelines, and checklists. A big part of this is identifying areas where we can improve.
7.2  Identify Improvement Areas
After the appraisal, our first task is to analyze the improvement areas list from the appraisal report. We also 
want to analyze other improvement areas identified and noted by the SEPG team.
Every improvement area needs to be analyzed for its potential benefit versus the effort required 
to implement it, as this will help us to strengthen the QMS. In Chapter 6, we covered how anyone can 
contribute ideas to improve it. Whenever anyone on the team identifies an area for process improvement, 
that person can raise the process improvement request to SEPG team (see Figure 7-1).

Chapter 7 ■ Focus on Continual Improvement
104
The next step is to prepare the improvements for following teams:
• 
Project Delivery Team
• 
SEPG and QA
• 
Training
But as an organization, if there are other support departments (e.g., HR and Admin) that provide 
services to the preceding teams, then it makes sense for the organization to focus on improving the process 
for these teams, as well. This is because these other teams can also directly or indirectly impact the delivery 
of the project team for any xyz reasons.
Process improvement is a collective responsibility of the different teams within an organization, and the 
software process improvement group (SEPG) is responsible for implementing the process improvement.
■
■Note   It is not mandatory for the SEPG team to implement the request raised; the team can accept or reject 
the request, based on its own analysis.
Figure 7-1.  The sample process improvement form

Chapter 7 ■ Focus on Continual Improvement
105
7.3  Prioritize Improvement Areas
Once the improvement areas are identified or consolidated, the next important thing task is to prioritize the 
sequence of improvement areas in terms of which improvements will be implemented.
The SEPG team has to prioritize the improvements based on the implementation benefits proposed by 
the improvement.
Also, the SEPG team needs to ensure that the improvement list is reviewed and approved by senior 
management. During the review, senior management can also set the priority for various improvements, 
according to which requests it feels should be implemented first.
7.4  Prepare an Action Plan
Once the improvement areas are prioritized, the next step is to prepare the action plan for each 
improvement.
The action plan should capture the following information:
• 
An improvement description
• 
An improvement category (e.g., major or minor)
• 
How QMS artifacts are impacted (i.e., which processes, templates, checklists, and/or 
guidelines need to be updated or modified?)
• 
The training to be imparted or conducted
In the action plan, you should have a category for training and indicate “Yes” if training is required for 
the staff members based on the improvement. For example, if a new process is added into the QMS, then it is 
essential that staff members be trained on the new process or the modified/updated process.
If the improvement is minor, requiring only a small modification/update to the template and no 
training, then you need to indicate that no training is required.
You need to assign the improvement to a staff member. The assignment should include the following 
information:
• 
A target date of completion: The date by which the improvement implementation 
will be completed)
• 
The total effort planned (hours): Estimates the total hours required for the 
implementation
• 
Progress Update: The current phase of the update’s progress
A progress update section might look like the following:
• 
Date: April 27, 2016
 
Update: Process modification work is complete; template update is in progress
• 
Date: April 23, 2016
 
Update: Work has been initiated on the process modification
Capturing the update in this manner will help in determining and assessing the progress of the 
update. For example, it can help you determine whether a given implementation can be completed by the 
mentioned target date.
The progress update can also mention whether there is any delay or issue due to xyz reason. For 
example, if any input/information or discussion is pending or stakeholders are not available, then such 
points should be captured:

Chapter 7 ■ Focus on Continual Improvement
106
• 
Current Status: States might include Open, In-Progress, On-Hold, Deferred, 
ImplementationComplete, or Closed
• 
Implementation Review Period: Mention the timeline or the number of days for 
which improvement will be monitored after the implementation to gauge its 
effectiveness
• 
Implementation Review Status: States might include Status-Satisfactory and Not-
satisfactory (if the implementation isn’t satisfactory, then it needs to be reviewed 
again)
• 
Actual Completion Date: Indicate the date on which implementation was completed
• 
Actual Effort Spent (Hours): Indicate the total hours spent for implementing the 
improvement
■
■Note   In scenarios where the status is put on hold, the target completion date needs to be extended or 
replanned.
7.5  Review and Monitor
Once the improvement is implemented, the next step is to review and monitor the affected areas (i.e., the 
projects or support departments affected by the implementation).
This step is important because we have to assess whether the improvement implementation is effective, 
including whether staff members are able to adapt to the improvement.
To determine the implementation’s effectiveness, we need to define the parameters which might 
help in assessing the effectiveness level. If the result is found to be not satisfactory based on those defined 
parameters, then we have to analyze and identify the factors that caused the implementation to be 
ineffective.
For example, it might be that a few teams were not trained well in the new process. Consequently, the 
desired result could not be achieved. Or, it might be that the new defined process is not adding value, or its 
process execution time has increased. Or, perhaps not all teams are able to use the new/updated process; 
hence, a separate new process needs to be created for these teams.
Here, we need to re-create the action plan for the steps we need to implement again (in a second 
implementation cycle). The goal is increase the effectiveness of the planned improvement. Once the second 
implementation cycle is complete, it’s time for the second round of the review and monitor cycle. We have to 
restart and reassess the effectiveness of this new change based on the defined parameters.
If the results are found to be satisfactory, then we can update the improvement implementation status 
as complete/closed.

Chapter 7 ■ Focus on Continual Improvement
107
7.6  Summary
In this chapter, we learned how to focus on continual improvement (i.e., the implementation of 
improvements which are reported through the appraisal report by lead appraiser or identified internally by 
the SEPG team by various means). We also learned how to implement these improvements, what steps are 
required to do so, and how to assess whether the implemented improvements are effective or satisfactory.
7.7  References
This book was created by taking some reference material directly from the CMMI model and augmenting 
that based on the experience of the authors. At this juncture, we believe we have covered the most of 
required things to plan for an appraisal, so we are closing our guide for CMMI implementation. We would 
like to thank you, the reader, for taking this journey with us, but also to remind you that nothing is perfect in 
this universe, not even the authors!
We hope you had a great learning experience!
