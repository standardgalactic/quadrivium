LOCALLY CARTESIAN CLOSED CATEGORIES
WITHOUT CHOSEN CONSTRUCTIONS
ERIK PALMGREN
Abstract.
We show how to formulate the notion of locally cartesian closed category
without chosen pullbacks, by the use of Makkai‚Äôs theory of anafunctors.
1. Introduction
The standard formulation of a locally cartesian closed category (LCCC) depends on the
assumption of chosen pullbacks. One may not always assume that such pullbacks can be
chosen, working inside a topos, or in a meta-theory which lacks the full axiom of choice.
Such theories are, for instance, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, ZF, or constructive theories
of types and sets. Makkai [2, 3] developed a theory of generalised functors, anafunctors,
which can handle non-chosen limit constructions in a functorial way. We shall here apply
this theory to the example of LCCC. We thus give a formulation of LCCCs without chosen
constructions. In the course of this we also note that some basic results about adjoints
carry over to the anafunctor setting (Theorems 2.3 and 3.2). The results in Sections 4 and
5 indicate that categorical logic may be developed smoothly without chosen constructions.
2. Anafunctors
We choose to use the ‚Äúspan formulation‚Äù of anafunctors given in [2].
Let X and A
be categories.
An anafunctor F from X to A is a category |F| and pair of functors
F0 : |F|
/ X and F1 : |F|
/ A such that F0 satisÔ¨Åes the conditions
(A1) F0 is surjective on objects,
(A2) for any s, t ‚àà|F| and g : F0(s)
/F0(t) there is a unique f : s
/t with g = F0(f).
Denote this f by |g|s,t.

where F0 is full, faithful and surjective on objects.
Note that for s, t ‚àà|F| with X = F0(s) = F0(t) the morphism |idX|s,t : s
/ t is an
isomorphism. For s = t, |idX|s,t is ids. Note, further, that if X
f
‚àí‚ÜíY
g
‚àí‚ÜíZ in X, then
for any r, s, t ‚àà|F| with F0(r) = X, F0(s) = Y , F0(t) = Z, we have |g‚ó¶f|r,t = |g|s,t‚ó¶|f|r,s.
A standard functor F : X
/ A becomes an anafunctor ÀÜF : X 
/ A by letting
| ÀÜF| = X, ÀÜF1 = F and letting ÀÜF0 be the identity functor on X.
2.1. Remark. Using the axiom of choice, we may, given an anafunctor G : X 
/ A,
construct a standard functor ÀáG : X
/ A as follows. For any object X of X choose
H(X) in |G| with G0(H(X)) = X. Then put ÀáG(X) = G1(H(X)) and, for f : X
/ Y ,
let ÀáG(f) = G1(|f|H(X),H(Y )).
2.2. Remark. The composition of anafunctors is a composition of spans using a pullback,
and is associative merely up to canonical isomorphism. In [2] it is shown that categories,
anafunctors and natural transformations form a (super large) bicategory.
An anafunctor F : X 
/ A is said to preserve colimits of type I if, and only if, for every
functor H : I
/ |F| and c ‚àà|F|, œÑ : H
.
/ ‚àÜ(c): whenever F0œÑ : F0H
.
/ F0‚àÜ(c)
is a colimiting cone then so is F1œÑ : F1H
.
/ F1‚àÜ(c). Preservation of limits is deÔ¨Åned
dually. An anafunctor F : X 
/ A is said to preserve property P of arrows, if for any
f : s
/ t in |F|, whenever F0(f) has property P, then so has F1(f). Let F : X 
/ A
and G : A
/X be anafunctors. Then F is left adjoint (or anaadjoint) to G if for t ‚àà|F|
and v ‚àà|G| there are bijections
œït,v : A(F1(t), G0(v))
/ X(F0(t), G1(v))
(1)
satisfying the following naturality conditions
(N1) for s, t ‚àà|F|, v ‚àà|G|, h : s
/ t, f ‚ààA(F1(t), G0(v))
œït,v(f) ‚ó¶F0(h) = œïs,v(f ‚ó¶F1(h))
(N2) for t ‚àà|F|, v, w ‚àà|G|, k : v
/ w, g ‚ààX(F0(t), G1(v))
G0(k) ‚ó¶œï‚àí1
t,v(g) = œï‚àí1
t,w(G1(k) ‚ó¶g).
Note a particular case of (N1) where h : s
/ t is such that F0(h) = idX where
X = F0(s) = F0(t). Then œït,v(f) = œïs,v(f ‚ó¶F1(h)) and F1(h) is an isomorphism.
We have as for usual adjoints, and with a similar proof:

2.3. Theorem. Let F : X 
/ A and G : A 
/ X be anafunctors such that F is left
adjoint to G. Then:
(i) F preserves colimits of any type,
(ii) F preserves epis,
(iii) G preserves limits of any type,
(iv) G preserves monos.
2.4. Example. Suppose that F : X 
/ A is left adjoint to G : A 
/ X. For diagrams
of Ô¨Ånite type, i.e. where I is a Ô¨Ånite category such as indicated by

(2)
The axiom of choice is not needed for a Ô¨Ånite category and we can reason as follows.
Suppose that
X
f
/
g
/ Y
q
/ Z
is a coequalizer diagram in X. Pick some r, s, t ‚àà|F| with F0(r) = X, F0(s) = Y and
F0(t) = Z using (A1). Now, since F preserves colimits of the type to the right in (2), the
following is a coequalizer diagram in A
F1(r)
F1(|f|r,s)
/
F1(|g|r,s)
/ F1(s)
F1(|q|s,t)
/ F1(t)
This holds regardless of the choices of r, s, t satisfying the above equations.
For later reference we give details of the constructions involved in proofs (see [2]) of
the equivalence between local and global existence conditions for anaadjoints. This is
a generalisation of the corresponding results for ordinary functors [1]. An anafunctor
F : X 
/ A satisÔ¨Åes the local existence condition for a right adjoint (LR) if for any
A ‚ààA there are s ‚àà|F|, Œµ : F1(s)
/ A such that
(*) for each t ‚àà|F| and each h : F1(t)
/ A there is a unique ÀÜh : t
/ s with
Œµ ‚ó¶F1(ÀÜh) = h.
2.5. Lemma. An anafunctor F : X 
/ A satisÔ¨Åes (LR) if, and only if, there is a right
adjoint G : A 
/ X to F.

Proof. ( ks
) Suppose that G : A 
/ X is right adjoint to F and that œït,v is a family
of bijections witnessing the adjunction as in (1). We verify (LR): Let A ‚ààA be given.
Then take v ‚àà|G| with A = G0(v) and then s ‚àà|F| with F0(s) = G1(v). Put
Œµ = œï‚àí1
s,v(idG1(v)) : F1(s)
/ A.
(3)
Now consider any t ‚àà|F| and h : F1(t)
/A. Then k = œït,v(h) : F0(t)
/G1(v) = F0(s).
Let ÀÜh = |k|t,s : t
/ s. Hence by (N1) and inverting œït,v
Œµ ‚ó¶F1(ÀÜh)
=
œï‚àí1
s,v(idG1(v) ‚ó¶F1(ÀÜh))
=
œï‚àí1
t,v(œïs,v(œï‚àí1
s,v(idG1(v)) ‚ó¶F0(ÀÜh))
=
œï‚àí1
t,v(idG1(v) ‚ó¶F0(ÀÜh))
=
œï‚àí1
t,v(F0(ÀÜh)) = œï‚àí1
t,v(k) = h.
Suppose that h‚Ä≤ : t
/ s satisÔ¨Åes Œµ ‚ó¶F1(h‚Ä≤) = h. As above Œµ ‚ó¶F1(ÀÜh) = œï‚àí1
t,v(F0(h‚Ä≤)). Thus
œï‚àí1
t,v(F0(h‚Ä≤)) = œï‚àí1
t,v(F0(ÀÜh)), and since œït,v is a bijection F0(h‚Ä≤) = F0(ÀÜh). As F0 is faithful,
we have in fact h‚Ä≤ = ÀÜh.
For h‚Ä≤ : t
/ s we note a useful identity
Œµ ‚ó¶F1(h‚Ä≤) = œï‚àí1
t,v(F0(h‚Ä≤)).
(4)
(
+3) We construct G as follows. Let |G| be the category whose objects are triples (A, s, Œµ)
where A ‚ààA, s ‚àà|F|, Œµ : F1(s)
/ A satisÔ¨Åes universal property (*). In this category a
morphism from (A, s, Œµ) to (A‚Ä≤, s‚Ä≤, Œµ‚Ä≤) is a pair (f, g) where f : s
/ s‚Ä≤, g : A
/ A‚Ä≤ are
such that the square

commutes. According to the universal property of (A‚Ä≤, s‚Ä≤, Œµ‚Ä≤) the morphism f is determined
uniquely by g. Next, deÔ¨Åne G0 : |G|
/ A by G0(A, s, Œµ) = A and G0(f, g) = g, which
is seen to be a functor that satisÔ¨Åes (A2). By (LR) it follows that (A1) holds. Then
deÔ¨Åne G1 : |G|
/ X by G1(A, s, Œµ) = F0(s) and G1(f, g) = F0(f). Thus G : A 
/ X
is an anafunctor. To prove that F is left adjoint to G we construct, for t ‚àà|F| and
v = (A, p, Œµ) ‚àà|G|, the bijection
œït,v : A(F1(t), G0(v))
/ X(F0(t), G1(v))
as follows.
We have Œµ : F1(p)
/ A and A = G0(p) since v ‚àà|G|.
For any h ‚àà
A(F1(t), G0(v)) there is a unique ÀÜh : t
/ p with Œµ ‚ó¶F1(ÀÜh) = h. Let œït,v(h) = F0(ÀÜh).

Now if œït,v(h2) = œït,v(h), then by faithfulness of F0 we get ÀÜh = bh2. Therefore h = h2 as
well. For a given k ‚ààX(F0(t), G1(v)), we have for some h : t
/ p that F0(h) = k , as
G1(v) = F0(p). Thus trivially œït,u(Œµ ‚ó¶F1(h)) = k.
To verify the naturality conditions (N1) and (N2) is straightforward.
Dually we have the following notion.
An anafunctor G : A 
/ X satisÔ¨Åes the local
existence condition for a left adjoint (LL) if for any X ‚ààX there is s ‚àà|G| and Œ∑ :
X
/ G1(s) such that
(**) for each t ‚àà|G| and each f : X
/ G1(t) there is a unique ÀÜf : s
/ t with
G1( ÀÜf) ‚ó¶Œ∑ = f.
2.6. Lemma. An anafunctor G : A 
/ X satisÔ¨Åes (LL) if, and only if, there is a left
adjoint F : X 
/ A to G.
Proof. The anafunctor F is constructed as follows. It is analogous to that of Lemma
2.5, but we spell it out for completeness. The proof of its properties is omitted., being
dual to that of the mentioned lemma.
The category |F| consists of triples (X, s, Œ∑) satisfying property (**). A morphism
(f, g) : (X, s, Œ∑)
/ (X‚Ä≤, s‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤) consists of f : X
/ X‚Ä≤ and g : s
/ s‚Ä≤ such that the
square


X
G1(s)
Œ∑
/ G1(s)
G1(s‚Ä≤)
G1(g)

commutes. According to the universal property, g is determined uniquely by f.
DeÔ¨Åne F0 : |F|
/ X and F1 : |F|
/ A by F0(X, s, Œ∑) = X, F0(f, g) = f,
F1(X, s, Œ∑) = G0(s) and F1(f, g) = g.
By the (LL) property it follows that F is an
anafunctor.
3. Natural transformations
We recall the deÔ¨Ånition from [2]. A natural transformation h : F
/ G between two
anafunctors F, G : X 
/ A is a family hs,t : F1(s)
/ G1(t) (s ‚àà|F|, t ‚àà|G|, F0(s) =
G0(t)) of morphisms in A such that for all f : s
/u and g : t
/v, with F0(s) = G0(t),
F0(u) = G0(v) and F0(f) = G0(g), the diagram

commutes. In case F and G are ordinary functors, i.e. F0 = G0 = IdX, this reduces to
the standard notion of natural transformation.
We now prove a little coherence result. Suppose that k : G
/ H is another natural
transformation, where G, H : X 
/ A are anafunctors. Then we claim that the diagram
G1(t)
H1(r)

hs,t

F1(s)
G1(t‚Ä≤)


commutes for any s ‚àà|F|, t, t‚Ä≤ ‚àà|G|, r ‚àà|H| with X = F0(s) = G0(t) = G0(t‚Ä≤) = H0(r).
There is a unique g : t
/ t‚Ä≤ with G0(g) = idX. Then F0(ids) = H0(idt) = G0(g), so by
naturality we have
kt‚Ä≤,r ‚ó¶hs,t‚Ä≤
=
kt‚Ä≤,r ‚ó¶hs,t‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶F1(ids)
=
kt‚Ä≤,r ‚ó¶G1(g) ‚ó¶hs,t
=
H1(idr) ‚ó¶kt,r ‚ó¶hs,t
=
kt,r ‚ó¶hs,t
Thus deÔ¨Åne the composition of k and h by
(k ¬∑ h)s,r = kt,r ‚ó¶hs,t
where t is any element of |G| with F0(s) = G0(t) = H0(r). Such t exists since G is
surjective on objects. It follows that (k ¬∑ h)s,r is well-deÔ¨Åned. Naturality is clear by the
naturality of h and k.
For an anafunctor F : X 
/ A the identity natural transformation 1F : F
/ F
is deÔ¨Åned by (1F)s,t = F1(|idX|s,t) for s, t ‚àà|F| with X = F0(s) = F0(t). A natural
transformation h : F
/ G between two anafunctors F, G : X 
/ A is a natural
isomorphism if there is a natural transformation k : G
/ F such that k ¬∑ h = 1F and
h ¬∑ k = 1G. We omit the straightforward veriÔ¨Åcation of the following lemma.
3.1. Lemma. Let F, G : X 
/ A be anafunctors, and let h : F
/ G be a natural
transformation. Then h is a natural isomorphism if, and only if, hs,t : F1(s)
/ G1(t) is
an isomorphism for all s ‚àà|F|, t ‚àà|G| with F0(s) = G0(t).
It is now possible to generalise the uniqueness results for adjoints to the anafunctor
case.
3.2. Theorem. Left and right adjoints (if they exist) of an anafunctor F : X 
/ A are
unique up to natural isomorphism.

LOCALLY CARTESIAN CLOSED CATEGORIES WITHOUT CHOSEN CONSTRUCTIONS 11
Proof. We prove this for right adjoints. Suppose that G, G‚Ä≤ : A 
/ X are both right
adjoints of F. Thus there are families of bijections
œït,v : A(F1(t), G0(v))
/ X(F0(t), G1(v))
(t ‚àà|F|, v ‚àà|G|)
and
œï‚Ä≤
t,v‚Ä≤ : A(F1(t), G‚Ä≤
0(v‚Ä≤))
/ X(F0(t), G‚Ä≤
1(v))
(t ‚àà|F|, v‚Ä≤ ‚àà|G‚Ä≤|)
satisfying (N1) and (N2).
We construct hv,v‚Ä≤ : G1(v)
/ G‚Ä≤
1(v‚Ä≤) for v ‚àà|G| and v‚Ä≤ ‚àà|G‚Ä≤| with G0(v) = G‚Ä≤
0(v‚Ä≤).
Take s, s‚Ä≤ ‚àà|F| with F0(s) = G1(v) and F0(s‚Ä≤) = G‚Ä≤
1(v‚Ä≤) and consider the counits
Œµs,v
=
œï‚àí1
s,v(idG1(v)) : F1(s)
/ G0(v)
Œµ‚Ä≤
s‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤
=
œï‚Ä≤‚àí1
s‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤(idG‚Ä≤
1(v‚Ä≤)) : F1(s‚Ä≤)
/ G‚Ä≤
0(v‚Ä≤).
Since G0(v) = G‚Ä≤
0(v‚Ä≤), there is thus a unique f : s
/ s‚Ä≤ with Œµ‚Ä≤
s‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶F1(f) = Œµs,v and a
unique g : s‚Ä≤
/ s with Œµs,v ‚ó¶F1(g) = Œµ‚Ä≤
s‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤. It follows by the universal properties that g
is the inverse to f. Write Œ∏s,s‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤ = f. DeÔ¨Åne
hv,v‚Ä≤ = F0(Œ∏s,s‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤).
This is an iso. We need to show that this deÔ¨Ånition does not depend on s and s‚Ä≤. Suppose
t, t‚Ä≤ ‚àà|F| with F0(t) = G1(v) and F0(t‚Ä≤) = G‚Ä≤
1(v‚Ä≤). There are unique k : s
/ t and
k‚Ä≤ : s‚Ä≤
/ t‚Ä≤ with F0(k) = idG1(v) and F0(k‚Ä≤) = idG‚Ä≤
1(v‚Ä≤). Thus to show F0(Œ∏s,s‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤) =
F0(Œ∏t,t‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤) it suÔ¨Éces to prove
k‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶Œ∏s,s‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤ = Œ∏t,t‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶k.
This is done by verifying that
Œµ‚Ä≤
t‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶F1(k‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶Œ∏s,s‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤) = Œµ‚Ä≤
t‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶F1(Œ∏t,t‚Ä≤,v,v‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶k)
from which the identity follows by the uniqueness. Indeed, we have using (N1) in the

4. Locally cartesian closed categories
Convention.. The objects of a slice category C/X are morphisms a : A
/X, and will
be written (A, a). As a further abbreviation we write Œ± = (A, a), Œ≤ = (B, b), Œ≥ = (C, c)
etc.
For any morphism f : X
/ Y the functor Œ£f : C/X
/ C/Y is given by composition
with f on objects, Œ£f(Œ±) = (A, f‚ó¶a), and deÔ¨Åned as the identity on morphisms Œ£f(h) = h.
We regard this functor as an anafunctor S = Sf : C/X 
/C/Y , so |S| = C/X, S0 = Id|S|
and S1 = Œ£f. The (LR) condition for S now says: for any Œ± ‚ààC/Y there is some œÄ ‚ààC/X
and e : (P, f ‚ó¶p)
/ Œ± such that for each œÄ‚Ä≤ ‚ààC/X and each h : (P ‚Ä≤, f ‚ó¶p‚Ä≤)
/ Œ± there
is a unique ÀÜh : œÄ‚Ä≤
/ œÄ with e ‚ó¶ÀÜh = h. This says, in other words, that for any Œ± ‚ààC/Y
there are morphisms p and e such that the following diagram is a pullback

Suppose that C is a category where pullbacks exists (but are not necessarily chosen). The
following can now be obtained from the construction in Lemma 2.5. DeÔ¨Åne for f : X

F1 : |F|
/ C/X by F1(Œ≤, œÄ, q) = œÄ and F1(h, k) = h. The functor F0 is surjective on
objects since pullbacks exists. As for (A2) suppose k : F0(Œ≤, œÄ, q)
/ F0(Œ≤‚Ä≤, œÄ‚Ä≤, q‚Ä≤), i.e.
k : Œ≤
/ Œ≤‚Ä≤. By the pullback property, there is a unique map h : P
/ P ‚Ä≤ with p‚Ä≤h = p
and kq = q‚Ä≤h, i.e. such that (h, k) : (Œ≤, œÄ, q)
/ (Œ≤‚Ä≤, œÄ‚Ä≤, q‚Ä≤) is a morphism. This shows
(A2). Hence we have shown:
4.1. Lemma. Let C be a category with pullbacks. For any f : X
/ Y the anafunctor
Sf : C/X 
/ C/Y is left adjoint to Ff : C/Y 
/ C/X.
We shall employ the usual notations Œ£f and f ‚àófor anafunctors Sf and Ff respectively.
The next step is to spell out the condition for f ‚àóto have a right anaadjoint.
This
gives a functorial deÔ¨Ånition of LCCCs without chosen constructions. The (LR) condition
for F = f ‚àó: C/Y 
/ C/X becomes explicitly: for every Œ≥ ‚ààC/X there are (***)
s = (Œ≤, œÄ, q) ‚àà|F| and e : F1(s) = œÄ
/ Œ≥ in C/X, i.e. there is a commutative diagram

i.e. t = (Œ≤‚Ä≤, œÄ‚Ä≤, q‚Ä≤) ‚àà|F| and h : F1(t) = œÄ‚Ä≤

/ s
such that
e ‚ó¶m = h.
(7)
Note that m is determined by n : Œ≤‚Ä≤
/ Œ≤ because of the pullback property.
For any category C, let MonC(X) be the full subcategory of C/X determined by objects
that are monomorphisms going into X.
4.2. Lemma. Let C be a category with pullbacks. Let f : X
/ Y be a morphism in C. If
f ‚àó: C/Y 
/ C/X satisÔ¨Åes the (LR) condition, then the anafunctor Œ†f : C/X 
/ C/Y ,
constructed as follows, is a right adjoint to f ‚àó.
The category |Œ†f| consists of triples
(Œ≥, s, e) such that (***) above is satisÔ¨Åed. Moreover, for s = (Œ≤, œÄ, q) and ((h, k), ‚Ñì) :
(Œ≥, s, e)
/ (Œ≥‚Ä≤, s‚Ä≤, e‚Ä≤),
(Œ†f)0(Œ≥, s, e)
=
Œ≥
(Œ†f)0((h, k), ‚Ñì)
=
‚Ñì
(Œ†f)1(Œ≥, s, e)
=
(f ‚àó)0(s) = Œ≤
(Œ†f)1((h, k), ‚Ñì)
=
(f ‚àó)0(h, k) = k.
Moreover, the functor Œ†f restricts to an anafunctor MonC(X) 
/ MonC(Y ).
Proof. The Ô¨Årst part follows directly from the general construction of a right adjoint in
Lemma 2.5.
As for the second part, let (Œ≥, s, e) ‚àà|Œ†f| and s = (Œ≤, œÄ, q) and suppose that Œ≥ ‚àà
MonC(X), i.e. c : C
/ X is mono. We show that b : B
/ Y is mono. Let r1, r2 :
B‚Ä≤
/ B be so that br1 = br2. Let b‚Ä≤ = br1. Form the pullback

As b‚Ä≤ = br1 = br2 there is, for each k = 1, 2, a unique uk : P ‚Ä≤
/ P with quk = rkq‚Ä≤
and puk = p‚Ä≤. By the equality pu1 = pu2 we get ceu1 = ceu2. Thus, since c is mono,

16
ERIK PALMGREN
eu1 = eu2. Let h = eu1. Hence ch = ceu1 = pu1 = p‚Ä≤. Thus we have a diagram just as
(6), with t = (œÄ‚Ä≤, Œ≤‚Ä≤, q‚Ä≤). Let (m, n) : t
/s be the unique morphism such that e‚ó¶m = h.
By the above (m, n) = (uk, rk), k = 1, 2, also satisÔ¨Åes these conditions. Hence r1 = r2,
which proves b to be mono.
5. Images and order reÔ¨Çection
Though images of morphisms may be formulated straightforwardly without any chosen
construct, we show how they arise by a left anaadjoint of the inclusion functor.
For any category C and any object X of the category, let IncX : MonC(X)
/C/X be
the inclusion functor, which we also regard as an anafunctor JncX : MonC(X) 
/ C/X.
The (LL) condition for JncX now reads as follows: for any Œ± ‚ààC/X there is Œπ ‚ààMonC(X)
and h : Œ±
/ Œπ such that
(‚Ä†) for any Œ∫ ‚ààMonC(X) and any f : Œ±
/ Œ∫ there is a unique ÀÜf : Œπ
/ Œ∫ with
ÀÜf ‚ó¶h = f.
Actually, the last constraint is unnecessary, since it follows from k‚ó¶f = a = i‚ó¶h = k‚ó¶ÀÜf ‚ó¶h
and that k is mono.
Consequently, the (LL) condition for JncX is equivalent to the
existence of images in C. The left adjoint anafunctor H = JmX : C/X
/ MonC(X) to
JncX is then, according to Lemma 2.6, given by the following. The category |H| consists
of as objects, triples (Œ±, Œπ, h) such that h : Œ±
/ Œπ and Œ± ‚ààC/X and Œπ ‚ààMonC(X) which
satisÔ¨Åes (‚Ä†). In other words, A
h
‚àí‚ÜíI
i
‚àí‚ÜíX is an image factorisation of a : A
/ X. A
morphism (f, g) : (Œ±, Œπ, h)
/(Œ±‚Ä≤, Œπ‚Ä≤, h‚Ä≤) then consists of f : Œ±
/Œ±‚Ä≤ and g : Œπ
/Œπ‚Ä≤ such
that g ‚ó¶h = h‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶f. Further H0(Œ±, Œπ, Œ∑) = Œ±, H0(f, g) = f and H1(Œ±, Œπ, Œ∑) = Œπ, H1(f, g) = g.
Each anafunctor between partial orders turns out to be naturally isomorphic to an
ordinary functor, and may thus be regarded simply as a monotone map. In fact, we have
a slightly stronger result.
5.1. Proposition. If F : (A, ‚â§)
/ (B, ‚â§) is some anafunctor from a preorder to a
partial order, then it is naturally isomorphic to an ordinary functor G : (A, ‚â§)
/(B, ‚â§).
Proof. When regarding a preorder (P, ‚â§) as a category, we write oa,b : a
/ b for
the unique arrow that exists if, and only if, a ‚â§b holds. The functor G is given by
G(a) = F1(s) where s ‚àà|F| is some object with F0(s) = a. This is a good deÔ¨Ånition,
since if a = F0(s) = F0(t), there is an isomorphism f : s
/ t with F0(f) = 1a.
Thus also F1(f) : F1(s)
/ F1(t) is an isomorphism, and hence F1(s) = F1(t), as B
is a partial order. One shows using a similar lifting argument that G is monotone: if
a ‚â§a‚Ä≤ then there are s and s‚Ä≤ with a = F0(s), a‚Ä≤ = F0(s‚Ä≤), and hence there is some
f : s
/ s‚Ä≤ with F0(f) = oa,a‚Ä≤ : a
/ a‚Ä≤.
Thereby F1(f) : F1(s)
/ F1(s‚Ä≤), that
is G(s) = F1(s) ‚â§F1(s‚Ä≤) = G(s‚Ä≤).
The natural isomorphism f : F 
/ ÀáG, where
ÀáG : (A, ‚â§)
/ (B, ‚â§) is the anafunctor version of G, is given by
fs,t = idG(t) = oG(t),G(t) : F1(s)
/ ÀáG(t)
for s ‚àà|F|, t ‚ààA with F0(s) = ( ÀáG)0(t) = t.

LOCALLY CARTESIAN CLOSED CATEGORIES WITHOUT CHOSEN CONSTRUCTIONS 17
As an application, an anafunctor MonC(X) 
/ MonC(Y ) thus gives rise to an equiv-
alent monotone map SubC(X)
/ SubC(Y ) in an obvious way using the proposition.
