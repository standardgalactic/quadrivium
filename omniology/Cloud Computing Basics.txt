Preface
Cloud Computing has emerged as a cost effective alternative to managing complex 
computing systems. Traditionally organizations of all sizes required computer net-
works within their businesses. Managing a network requires specialized expertise 
which many businesses lack. In many cases network management was outsourced 
but it still required the attention of businesses since computing service was consid-
ered essential. This is where the emergence of Cloud Computing is trying to fill a 
void where companies would want to focus on their core strengths and let others 
deal with managing their computing needs. From the start the Cloud Computing 
model has been attractive because it offers the users the ability to grow incremental-
ly and scale back when services were no longer needed. Moreover, a business could 
pay only for the services that they use. When there are so many businesses and 
people who want to use more sophisticated forms of computing services the Cloud 
Computing model fits well. At the same time it gives a major incentive to cloud 
providers to offer the necessary services by benefiting from economies of scale.
In this book under the Springer Briefs Series, I will present all the essential 
details that a potential user would want to consider before deciding on the use of 
cloud service. The book is divided into seven chapters. In Chapter 1, I will trace 
the history of the evolution of Cloud Computing as a viable service today and how 
it is helping entrepreneurs and small businesses have access to advanced services 
at a fraction of the cost. Chapter 2 will cover the details pertaining to the different 
forms in which one could use a cloud service. In particular, the reader will be able 
to understand the three basic types of service that the cloud service provider offers. 
These services offer varying levels of control to the user regarding their infrastruc-
ture. These are known as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Besides these three basic types, there are four 
different deployment modes in which cloud service is used. The most common form 
of cloud service is known as the Public Cloud. This is more like the Internet where 
there is nothing proprietary owned by the user. The Private Cloud is often used 
by large businesses that want to use the architecture of the Public Cloud but keep 
the computing resources all to themselves without sharing with others. The Private 
Cloud architecture is usually held in-house as a managed service. It can also be used 
as a hosted service. There are also two other models of cloud usage—Hybrid Cloud

Preface
and Community Cloud. The Hybrid cloud comes in two flavors—one in which the 
user owns a private cloud for much of their computing needs and uses a public cloud 
primarily for archival purposes. Another way of defining a hybrid cloud is one in 
which the user uses their computing resources for business critical applications and 
sensitive data and uses a public cloud for other general uses such as hosting a web 
site. The Community Cloud is more specialized in that it is used by a group of 
people with a common interest or a group of businesses that specialize in a particu-
lar industry such as automotive, health care or finance. Next I will describe how the 
cloud is used heavily today for storage and backup.
Chapter 3 discusses the many benefits that Cloud Computing offers as well as 
the drawbacks associated with the cloud. The details presented here would help a 
prospective cloud customer as to the things that they should look for in selecting 
a cloud service provider. Main expectations for the cloud customer are the service 
availability and the security and privacy of their data. To put things in proper per-
spective concerning the cloud service I will highlight some of the major outages in 
cloud service in the recent past so that businesses will be aware of some of the risks 
associated with a cloud service. Chapter 4 amplifies further on this theme where I 
describe about the major cloud providers and their services. In this chapter I provide 
detailed analysis of all the major cloud service providers and niche cloud service 
providers. In Chapter 5, I address the security aspects related to Cloud Computing. 
This is an important aspect of Cloud Computing that every user must be concerned 
with. In this chapter I describe the tools available to protect sensitive data in the 
cloud. Often businesses are faced with providing evidence to authorities about the 
compliance requirements such as HIPAA. This chapter will discuss the compliance 
aspects that a business must consider if it is necessary for them. In this regard I 
discuss about all the major federal laws in U.S. concerning data and privacy pro-
tection that a business may have to comply with as well as industry standards such 
as the Payment Card Industry Security Standards. Another important aspect that is 
discussed in this chapter deals with access control that is critical to security.
In Chapter 6, I provide the necessary details that a business would need from a 
cost and risk perspective in using cloud services. There is detailed discussion on 
the various types of risks that a business might face when moving their computing 
resources to the cloud. This discussion sheds light on how using a cloud service is 
similar to outsourcing. A detailed look at these two aspects shows the similarities 
and differences between the two types of services. Chapter 7 is the concluding chap-
ter in the book which provides details on what businesses should look for in a Cloud 
Computing contract in order for them to know how reliable the service would be 
and how they could limit their liability. Extensive details are presented on what to 
expect from the cloud service provider and what remedy, if any, the cloud customer 
would have when a Service Level Agreement provision is violated. The material 
presented throughout the book focuses on making the cloud customers understand 
the complexities involved in dealing with the cloud and how they may already be 
dealing with a cloud service without their knowledge. My goal in this book is to 
present the material in a simple and easy to understand manner, with several ex-
amples highlighting the various topics discussed.

Abstract  Cloud computing has emerged as a cost effective alternative to having 
reliable computing resources without owning any of the infrastructure. The growth 
of this technology mirrors the growth of computing in general. The options offered 
by cloud services fit the needs of businesses of all types. As a truly global technol-
ogy, cloud computing is growing rapidly, albeit without any global standards. The 
benefits of cloud computing are too numerous to hold back adoption. At present 
the goal is to meet the business needs and as the technology matures it will accom-
modate changes emanating from global standards. As the first step in this direction 
many of the major cloud service providers are joining multiple consortia to develop 
the standards. This chapter addresses the history of the growth of cloud computing 
and the three basic service types—SaaS, PaaS, IaaS—that help businesses of all 
types. We identify the major cloud service providers and the cloud service types 
that they offer. We discuss the ways in which cloud computing is supporting entre-
preneurial activities. Our analysis shows further that the advancements in com-
munications technology is benefiting cloud computing and makes it a truly global 
service. Moreover, cloud computing technology is making a major contribution to 
ecommerce.

1.1  Introduction
Overall technology growth has been steady. This type of growth spans multiple 
areas—communications, devices, computing hardware, computing software, video 
creation, entertainment, etc. One such new technology in computing is Cloud Com-
puting. It is not a revolutionary technology like the Internet was but packages some 
of the existing technologies in a more user friendly and cost effective way. The 
success of any new technology is measured by its acceptance by the intended users. 
As new technologies both telephone and television revolutionized their respective 
fields. It took telephones over 75 years to gain widespread use. On the other hand, 
television took only 13 years to gain widespread use. Personal computers which 
evolved from general computers took only 16 years to become common household 
item. The internet was launched in 1969 as ARPANET by the US ­government for use

by a select group of research institutions. It grew slowly and gained global accep-
tance within a span of 4 years once the infrastructure was built. Newer technologies 
such as the Google Search Engine and YouTube took much shorter to attain critical 
mass. The Social Media giants Facebook and Twitter started out slow in growth but 
grew rapidly since then. Today, Google has over 540 million users, Facebook has 
over 1.3 billion users and Twitter has over 230 million users. Table 1.1 summarizes 
the time span of acceptance for the old and new technologies.
It is important to realize that the growth of certain technologies depend on the 
availability of the proper infrastructure. All modern technologies benefit from the 
availability of several enabling technology. In this sense cloud computing is a ben-
eficiary since the internet is available globally and the communication technology 
has grown significantly. Because of the availability of higher bandwidth for com-
munication the response time for applications running on a distant server is very 
low. This feature is known as low latency. Given the availability of these enabling 
technologies, cloud computing moved the computing infrastructure to the inter-
net. Prior to the advent of cloud computing the server utilization rates were very 
low. Cloud computing took advantage of the wide availability of internet and the 
greater communication speed and leveraged the concept of virtual machines (VMs). 
A virtual machine runs on a physical hardware and since the server utilization rate 
has been very low, the VM concept was able to launch multiple VMs on a single 
physical hardware and increase the server utilization rate. This approach is the key 
to cloud computing where the infrastructure resides with an external provider and 
serves thousands of customers. Since the customer needs only an internet connec-
tion in order to use the cloud computing service, many cloud service providers are 
able to serve a global audience.
The cloud computing was initiated less than a decade ago. The web based com-
pany Amazon, which already had extensive experience running its business over the 
web, invested heavily in creating the infrastructure that businesses and individuals 
would need and took the chore of managing a computer system away from the 
businesses and ordinary users. Because of economies of scale, cloud computing is 
able to consolidate the services on the cloud and offer the services over the internet. 
Other companies that had a significant web presence already then launched their 
own cloud service. Thus grew the cloud services Google Apps, Microsoft Office

Over the past 5 years, based on customer concerns for privacy protection, the pre-
vailing laws and industry standards many of the cloud services have enacted steps 
to provide reliable and secure cloud service. These large companies started offer-
ing a variety of cloud services that enabled innovation and the launch of several 
entrepreneurial cloud ventures such as Dropbox, Netflix and Flickr that used the 
cloud services of these major providers in order to provide their niche services. In 
the remaining sections of this chapter we will consider the various factors that have 
contributed to the growth of cloud computing.
1.2  Growth of Technology
Cloud computing today is benefiting from the technological advancements in com-
munication, storage and computing. The basic idea in cloud computing is to take 
advantage of economies of scale so that IT services could be provided on demand 
with a decentralized infrastructure. This idea is a natural evolution from the IT time-
share model of the 1960s and 1970s. Today, technology has advanced significantly 
and many more organizations have computing demands that are elastic in nature. 
Organizations large and small require reliable computing resources in order to suc-
ceed in business. Large businesses deal with complex systems where as Small and 
Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) need access to affordable computing resources. 
Based on these aspects, some of the rationale for today’s cloud computing needs can 
be summarized as follows:
• acquiring and managing the IT resources requires specialized skills
• maintaining a reliable IT infrastructure is expensive
• rapid technology advancements make it difficult to keep current the IT expertise
• internet has opened up many opportunities for individuals as well as small busi-
nesses
• number of entities requiring computing resources has grown exponentially
• SMEs’ demand for computing resources varies significantly over time
• providing data security is a complex undertaking
In the above paragraph some of the major reasons as to why cloud computing would 
be advantageous to usehas been identified. The phrase ‘cloud computing’ is used 
as a catch all for many types of online computing services. In this book we use the 
phrase ‘cloud computing’ in the way most businesses consider—computing over the 
internet with capability to grow or shrink resources on demand and pay only for the 
services used. Formally, we follow the definition of NIST developed by Mell and 
Grance. The NIST definition of ‘cloud computing’ is “Cloud computing is a model 
for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance 2011). With 
this definition of cloud computing we analyze how businesses are using this new

tool. When a significant part of the business depends on a type of service that the 
business does not fully control, the question arises as to how the business can meet 
its obligations to its customers. As highlighted above, IT services are essential to the 
success of the business but it would be cost prohibitive for many businesses to man-
age an IT center with the required expertise and fluctuating demand on resources for 
processing and storage. Thus, a business using cloud computing must understand 
the security challenges that it would be responsible for and how cloud computing 
could help in this regard. More details on the security aspects of cloud computing 
are provided in detail in Chapter 5.
Before looking at the variations of technologies that led up to the concept of 
‘cloud computing,’ let us first understand how this terminology came into use. It is 
difficult to attribute the first use of the phrase ‘cloud computing’ to anyone individ-
ual. However, it is safe to state that the first known recorded use of the term comes 
from a 1996 Business Plan by the erstwhile computer company Compaq. Since then 
Compaq merged with HP (MIT 2011). The phrase is also mentioned in the 1997 
Trademark application by a company called NetCentric (Source Digit 2012). The 
company is now defunct. If any individuals were to be associated with the earliest 
use of the phrase ‘cloud computing’ it would be George Favoloro of Compaq and 
Sean O’Sullivan of NetCentric. Looking back at the evolution of the Internet, it 
was 1995 when the use of Internet became widespread. Thus, the above timeline of 
1996 and 1997 fit well with the introduction of the ‘cloud computing’ concept. The 
person who could be credited for popularizing the phrase ‘cloud computing’ is Eric 
Schmidt, former CEO of Google. On August 9, 2006, at the Search Engine Strate-
gies Conference in San Jose, CA, while referring to an emerging new computing 
model he said, “I don’t think people have really understood how big this opportu-
nity really is. It starts with the premise that the data services and architecture should 
be on servers. We call it cloud computing—they should be in a “cloud” somewhere” 
(Schmidt 2006). This initial talk about this new concept was followed by an actual 
service called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that was launched by Amazon Web 
Services on August 24, 2006 (Amazon 2012).
Researching the advancements in technology we are able to come up with the 
following timeline for the growth of cloud computing. Even though this technol-
ogy has been around now for over a decade, only now it has become a mainstream 
technology. We show this timeline in Fig. 1.1 above.
Two of the important facilitators of cloud computing are the Internet and the 
bandwidth to move large volumes of data. Since the 1960s, cloud computing has

grown in many ways even though it was not known by that phrase in the early days. 
Since the Internet started to offer higher bandwidth in the mid-1990s, benefits of 
cloud computing for the public at large have evolved rather slowly. One of the ma-
jor milestones for cloud computing was the launching of Salesforce.com in 1999. It 
pioneered the concept of delivering enterprise applications via an easy-to-use web-
site. Today salesforce.com is known for its CRM application over the Internet. The 
next development was Amazon Web Services in 2002, which provided a suite of 
cloud-based services including storage, computation and even human intelligence 
through the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Then in 2006, Amazon launched its Elastic 
Compute Cloud (EC2) as a commercial web service that allows small companies 
and individuals to lease computers on which to run their own computer applica-
tions. Today, Amazon leads in cloud computing services to a vast array of small and 
medium sized companies and individuals.
The popularity of cloud services relies on the availability of reliable technology 
to support the service. In this connection the maturity of web in 2009 is noteworthy 
when Web 2.0 became widely available. Simultaneously, Google Apps provided 
several browser-based enterprise applications. This is a significant contributor to 
Software as a Service (SaaS) gaining greater foothold in the marketplace (Google 
Apps 2014). Besides Google, other companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Rack-
space started offering cloud-based services (IDC Report 2012). A significant advan-
tage of cloud-based services is the ability to use virtualization technology to offer 
each client their own computing infrastructure that appears dedicated but yet shared 
with other users. Availability of high-speed bandwidth has contributed to the reli-
ability of cloud computing. As far as standards are concerned, they are still evolving 
with respect to cloud services. In order to reap the full benefits of cloud services the 
industry needs to adopt universal standards which will greatly enhance interoper-
ability among the various providers.
1.3  A Paradigm Shift in Computing
Cloud computing is a significant shift in the way IT services are managed. Organi-
zations large and small have managed IT services over the years with varying lev-
els of investments. Today, with advancements in communication technology, many 
new options have opened up for existing businesses and new entrepreneurs want to 
use more of the capabilities of IT. These two aspects have spawned the significant 
growth of cloud computing, which gives the customer the ability to benefit from the 
pay-as-you-go model. Cloud computing has enabled the service providers to benefit 
from the economies of scale.
This change in service rendering is necessitated by the fact that today’s workforce 
is increasingly mobile and consequently the need for access to remote resources is 
greater. Moreover, demand fluctuations for IT services are a reality. Businesses can-
not afford to provision IT services to meet peak demand, which occur infrequently. 
Cloud computing provides an ideal solution to meet these needs without incurring 
significant cost in services provisioning.

6
1  Cloud Computing Evolution
Investments necessary to have a reliable IT service kept many prospective en-
trepreneurs from creating online ventures. On the web, businesses large and small 
look alike. Cloud computing is providing entrepreneurs the opportunity to try their 
ideas out, with IT services no longer holding them back as a barrier to entry. The 
major beneficiaries of cloud computing are small and medium sized businesses as 
this new concept provides them an opportunity to try out high-end services with no 
up-front cost, allowing them to use the pay-as-you-go model.
Large enterprises also stand to benefit from cloud computing, although of a dif-
ferent nature. Large enterprises manage data centers and the IT paradigm shift re-
ferred to earlier mean more in the context of accessing data from the data centers. 
In this context private clouds have been introduced where the benefits of storage 
management and elasticity in demand for computing services are the key drivers. 
Moreover, the cloud technology also offers high level of reliability and availability 
of systems without significant capital layout. Often, the benefits of cloud comput-
ing are realized by taking a hybrid approach. The hybrid approach gives the large 
organizations the ability to manage their IT centers and at the same time expand 
their computing capacity without large capital investment by utilizing the cloud 
resources. This is especially useful to meet seasonal peak demands with hybrid 
clouds. Organizations with seasonal high demands that could benefit from hybrid 
clouds are in the entertainment industry around holidays, sports networks with on-
demand service and tax service providers.
In assessing cloud computing’s appeal we should consider the usage levels of 
organizational servers. Server utilization level gives a good metric to see if the in-
vestment cost is worth it. The U.S. federal government started looking at the server 
utilization in its data centers several years ago. It is now widely reported that among 
all data centers in use the server utilization rate is between 6 % and 20 %. Even 
Google’s server utilization rate is around 40 %. One reason for the low utilization is 
the lack of virtualization and the need to use dedicated servers for multiple operat-
ing systems as well as separation of sensitive applications. Cloud computing is a 
natural fit to address the low utilization aspect because of higher level of virtualiza-
tion. With multiple users sharing the computing resources, cloud computing has a 
very high level of server utilization (Hayes 2008).
Cloud computing architecture enables businesses to meet demand elasticity in 
computing resources. Business organizations have great difficulty in dealing with 
demand elasticity for cost considerations. A useful model to compare here is how net-
works manage elasticity in bandwidth demand. For cost reasons network bandwidth 
provisioning uses the Committed Information Rate (CIR) model. Likewise, cloud 
computing provides a similar feature in meeting demand elasticity in both storage and 
computing power. Without the ability to meet demand elasticity, businesses may end 
up with an underprovisioned service. In that case customers would abandon such ser-
vices. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos highlights the success of extreme demand for com-
puting power within a very short period of time from Animoto that Amazon was able 
to accommodate (Bezos 2008). This is a good illustration of high demand elasticity.
In the traditional model, the end user had control over the creation, maintenance 
and deletion of a document. In the cloud environment, the end user is spared the 
trouble of maintaining the computing system and reaps the benefits of the applica-

7
1.3  A Paradigm Shift in Computing
tion software. This is a positive aspect of cloud storage. However, it is not entirely 
clear to the end user that when a document is deleted it is going to be inaccessible 
from the storage system. There have been instances where the document lingered 
on in the storage system of the cloud provider. These types of issues are unique 
to cloud computing and thus are a departure from the standard expectation of a 
computer system. Thus, we note that a shift in approach is needed in order to have 
control over the online information.
Many large organizations are considering cloud based services as a cost-effec-
tive way to plan for disaster recovery. The main cloud service type being considered 
for this is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Data backup is another service area in 
which cloud computing is gaining ground. The promise of these two services in the 
cloud has brought Microsoft and Iron Mountain together to offer data backup and 
recovery. The customer pays for this service based on the amount of storage used 
and the retention period for backup data. This service has the added benefit of offsite 
storage built-in that is essential for disaster recovery and backup because the cloud 
provider is remotely located relative to the customer. An essential component of ef-
ficient data backup is data de-duplication, also known as ‘intelligent compression.’ 
The de-duplication method allows for storing only one copy of the data and provid-
ing a pointer from all future occurrences of the same data. Data de-duplication can 
be performed at the file or block level. The latter is more efficient than the former. 
In typical email backups many users may have the same file as an attachment and 
so the same file is backed up multiple times. Using the de-duplication approach 
only one copy is saved and all other references point to the same copy. This is a 
typical file level de-duplication. Most often de-duplication is more efficient at the 
block level. In this approach each block of data is hashed using an MD5 or SHA-1 
algorithm and the hash index is stored. Future hashes of blocks producing the same 
hash index are treated as duplicates and not stored. There are sophisticated methods 
available to detect hash collision, which is rare (Armbrust et al. 2010).
As noted, cloud computing provides a cost effective alternative for users to con-
sider a centralized service that provides computing power, storage alternatives and 
high reliability. This is a paradigm shift in computing because with the introduction 
of Client/Server computing more businesses controlled their computing resources 
and data storage. However, the demand fluctuations for services and the greater 
need for remote access to data from multiple devices have made it more difficult 
for many organizations to keep with advancements in technology. This is where 
we notice a paradigm shift in what cloud computing could provide at a fraction 
of the cost. Cloud computing’s major benefit is the pay-as-you-go business model 
that it offers. This paradigm shift comes at the cost of security concerns because 
businesses are hesitant to lose control over where and how their data is stored. The 
Cloud Security Alliance and the Cloud Industry Forum are providing businesses 
with many resources to assess the cloud services prior to switching to cloud services 
(Cloud Security Alliance 2014, Cloud Industry Forum 2014).
Every business is noticing tremendous increase in data availability and the need to 
store the data. Anytime data is stored it comes with the associated cost of securing as 
well as backing up the data. This increased demand on the need to make the data avail-
able on a continuous basis is making data centers reach their capacity quickly. This 

8
1  Cloud Computing Evolution
forces the businesses to consider options to increase their storage capacity knowing 
full well that there could be fluctuations in storage needs. The pay-as-you-go model 
offered by cloud service providers to meet this demand is what makes the cloud an 
important technology to evaluate. This is a major shift in thinking for many businesses 
as they realize that they would have to relinquish physical control of their data. This is 
yet another paradigm shift for large businesses in their use of private clouds.
1.4  Global Marketplace
Many technologies have emerged over the years that have helped facilitate bringing 
people together in order to grow the world economies. Some of these technologies 
include various forms of transportation, communication and most recently the Inter-
net. All these technologies had a global impact. Some of these technologies facili-
tated global commerce, but in localized ways. Internet, however, facilitated the par-
ticipation of people around the globe in truly enhancing global commerce. In paving 
the way for global participation, the Internet opened up the ability of entrepreneurs 
around the world to contribute to global commerce. For example, when one business 
in a country is seeking a specialized part then the ability to supply that part is no lon-
ger limited to that country alone because businesses around the world would be able 
to know about it and help make that part at an affordable cost. This kind of global 
competition enables higher quality products to enter the market place and every sup-
plier is aware that in order to compete they have to have an edge over the competition.
In the above paragraph we identified the role of some of the technologies that 
have contributed to the growth of the global marketplace. Let us now review the rel-
evance of this possibility in the global marketplace with regard to cloud computing. 
One of the key facilitators of cloud computing is the ability to distribute the infor-
mation repository in the cloud whereby many entrepreneurs around the world could 
contribute to the product or service. For example, tax and legal service are two 
areas where there is a need to have plenty of local information in order to prepare 
the necessary forms. With the Internet providing the ability to share all the relevant 
requirements people from around the world with the necessary tax and legal exper-
tise could participate in providing the necessary service at a competitive cost. With 
the competition now being truly global people will have the opportunity to choose 
the most reliable and quality service provider. This possibility clearly elevates the 
quality of service for the consumer. With cloud computing, many entrepreneurs will 
have the ability to have a web presence at an affordable cost so that they could make 
their services known to people around the world. Today the publishing world is le-
veraging this availability of quality providers around the world with the capability 
to provide timely service. Cloud computing is a major contributor to this success.
Success of cloud computing in the global marketplace depends heavily on the 
ability to share information across national borders. This information sharing capa-
bility relies on the maturity of the ICT (Information and Communication Technolo-
gies) sector and the regulatory environment in a country. Fortunately, OECD (Or-
ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries have the neces-

9
1.5  Distributed Nature of Service Provisioning
sary laws that regulate Intellectual Property (IP) protection. Most of the developed 
countries around the world are members of the 34-nation OECD countries (OECD 
2014). These countries now account for nearly 80 % of the global ICT market that 
is essential for cloud computing (BSA 2012). Thus, cloud computing is playing a 
significant role in the global marketplace.
Today, due to the global nature of the Internet, services can be provided from 
anywhere in the globe. With the widespread availability of cloud computing such 
providers could customize their services to different parts of the world by using 
cloud service providers in those respective countries. This is to protect the com-
pany’s data from trans-border data flow constraints. Countries are realizing the po-
tential benefits of information sharing online and enacting policies accordingly.
1.5  Distributed Nature of Service Provisioning
In order to address the security challenges associated with cloud computing, we 
need to understand first the meaning of cloud computing. The primary reason for 
this is that the term ‘cloud computing’ is used as a catch-all for a wide ranging array 
of services. After a careful analysis of numerous sources in the literature we have 
arrived at the following working definition of ‘cloud computing’ based primarily 
on the National Institute of Standards and Technology definition: cloud computing 
consists of both the infrastructure and services that facilitate reliable on-demand 
access to resources that can be allocated and released quickly by the user without 
provider intervention using the pay-as-you-go model (NIST 2011).
Today’s cloud computing has three basic types: Software as a Service (SaaS), 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In the simplest 
of terms ‘cloud computing’ has come to embody SaaS. Similar to the IT time-share 
model mentioned earlier, SaaS provides both the server hardware and software to 
an organization without any of the complications of managing an IT system. The 
simplest example of SaaS service would be email for an organization. The cloud 
provider benefits from the economies of scale in managing a large infrastructure 
because of their strength in that area and is able to provide the necessary computing 
resources to the user, majority of who are SMEs, at an affordable cost. SaaS leaves 
the full control of the computing system with the provider. Some of the major com-
mercial SaaS providers are Amazon, Google, Microsoft and SalesForce.
SaaS is the most widely used cloud computing service. There are two important 
sub components in the type of SaaS service available for the users. One type is 
the Application Service Provider (ASP) model. In this model, the ASP provider is 
responsible for managing all aspects of the application for its currency and patch 
management. The user simply pays for the service. The second type is the Hosted 
Application Management (HAM) model. HAM is somewhat like ASP, except that 
the HAM provider hosts for the user commercially available software over the web. 
This is a true software-on-demand application in which the HAM provider hosts 
a special version of the software created for web distribution. The benefits to the 
customer are that all end users of the customer use the same software and it gets 

10
1  Cloud Computing Evolution 
managed the same way for all end users belonging to that customer. We will discuss 
ASP and HAM relative to cloud services in greater detail in Chap. 2.
PaaS provides the customer a platform, such as the Windows operating system, 
with the necessary server capacity to run the applications for the customer. The PaaS 
cloud service provider manages the system for its upkeep and provisioning of tools 
such as.NET and Java whereas the customer is responsible for the selection of ap-
plications that run on the platform of their choice using the available tools. Thus, the 
customer is responsible for the security challenges associated with the applications 
that they run. For example, a customer running a SQL Server database on the platform 
should be aware of the vulnerabilities of the database system. Hence, the customer 
should have the expertise to manage such applications on the platform used under 
this pay-as-you-go model. The benefit to the customer is that if their hardware needs 
change or if they require a Linux/UNIX platform for some other applications, then 
provisioning them takes only a few days as opposed to few weeks to make the new 
system operational. One potential drawback with PaaS is that if the customer requires 
some specialized applications or programming languages, then the customer risks 
being “locked in” to the provider. Major PaaS cloud service providers are Google 
App Engine and Windows Azure (Google Apps 2014, Windows Azure 2014).
IaaS provides the customer the same features as PaaS but the customer is fully 
responsible for the control of the leased infrastructure. IaaS may be viewed as the 
computing system of the customer that is not owned by them. Unlike PaaS, IaaS 
requires the organization to have the necessary people with extensive computing 
expertise. The IaaS customer would be responsible for all security aspects of the 
system that they use except physical security, which would be handled by the cloud 
provider. IaaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). Amazon and IBM are 
examples of IaaS providers. Companies with the necessary computing expertise in 
the form of trained people that wants to test a new service using a different platform 
would benefit from using IaaS as it would give greater control over the confidential-
ity of their test. We summarize the results so far in the following table: (Tab. 1.2)

1.5  Distributed Nature of Service Provisioning
The discussion so far has focused on the three basic types of cloud services—
SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. These three types of cloud services aim to meet the customer 
requirements at different levels of engagement in managing the computing hard-
ware and software. This has a direct correlation to the size of the organization in 
choosing the type of cloud service. For this reason we can broadly classify the cloud 
computing users as belonging to either the public cloud or the private cloud. Small 
and medium sized businesses typically use the public cloud and large organizations 
use the private cloud. All the cloud service providers mentioned earlier provide both 
public and private cloud services. In the private cloud, a large organization which 
has a data center to manage, is able to use large amounts of storage and comput-
ing power dedicated to just their organization only. The private cloud facilitates 
the large organization to handle demand elasticity similar to the public cloud pro-
vider. A natural evolution from these two service models is the hybrid cloud which 
uses both proprietary computing resources and/or private cloud resources that the 
organization manages directly and the public cloud for some of the computing re-
quirements, especially the ones with varying demands on resources (Bhattacharjee 
2009). Two of the major hybrid cloud providers currently are VMware and HP. 
Another important cloud model that is in use today is the community cloud. Com-
munity cloud is a form of public cloud that is limited to a particular group having 
a common interest, a vertical market segment. In such a scenario it would be eco-
nomical for these organizations to have a dedicated cloud service that caters to the 
health care industry. For example, health care related organizations such as hospi-
tals, pharmacies, and insurance providers have several things that they have to be 
compliant with as part of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act). A community cloud in this area could focus on the common concerns of the 
industry partners who belong to this community. The National Institute of Standards 
and Technology defines a community cloud as “an infrastructure shared by several 
organizations that supports a specific community that has shared concerns” (NIST 
2012). We will discuss in detail these cloud concepts—public, private, hybrid, and 
community—in Chap. 2.
It is worth noting that the three major types of services described above are 
gaining ground. According to the Ponemon Institute/CA Technologies 2011 study, 
among cloud service providers, SaaS accounts for 55 %, PaaS accounts for 11 % 
and IaaS accounts for 34 % (Ponemon Institute 2011). Another important statistic 
to note is that 65 % provide public cloud service while 18 % each provide private 
cloud and hybrid services.
Earlier in this section we looked at the three basic types of cloud services—SaaS, 
PaaS and IaaS. Cloud computing supports various types of service provisioning 
such as availability of software and hardware for use as in SaaS. We will now con-
sider several other ways in which cloud services could be deployed.
Storage as a Service is a business model in which a cloud service provider rents 
space in their storage infrastructure. Since SaaS is a well-known acronym for Soft-
ware as a Service, we will use StaaS as the acronym for Storage as a Service. In this 
model, the StaaS provider will enter into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with 
a business needing automated backup and transfer data directly into their storage 
system. The business will pay for this service both for storage used as well as for 

12
1  Cloud Computing Evolution
the bandwidth used to transfer the data from the business to the storage facility. This 
service frees up the business to concentrate on their core strengths and the StaaS 
provider does the data backup for the business. If and when the business needs the 
stored data, the StaaS provider will be able to transfer the data to the business. Un-
der this agreement the StaaS provider will also be able to provide the added service 
of encrypting the stored data for the business. This additional service would provide 
the business the necessary security for the stored data. This service provides an im-
portant option for small and medium-sized businesses to promote data backup and 
plan for disaster recovery and business continuity. Moreover, such businesses will 
be able to afford having long-term data retention for their important data.
Security as a Service (SecaaS) is an important model that has great potential 
to succeed. Under this model companies that do not have sufficient expertise in 
security management can outsource security aspects. Typical applications in this 
area are deployment of Anti-virus software and network monitoring. This service 
will benefit more the small and medium sized companies because they lack the 
expertise needed to manage security for their data. Gartner Research noted that this 
type of service would generate 60 % of revenue in that industry by 2013 (Gartner 
Research 2013). The major providers of this type of service are Cisco, McAfee, 
Symantec, Verisign, and Trend Micro. Given the reputation of these companies in 
the security industry there is a high probability that Security as a Service would be 
well received.
Today the growth of data available for processing is tremendous. This requires 
the ability to store large volumes of data and at the same time process the data fast. 
So, many entrepreneurial companies are developing a new type of service known 
as Data as a Service (DaaS). The basic premise of this model is to generate infor-
mation in a timely manner by processing a diverse set of data held in text, image, 
sound and video form. Much of this data is generated by social media. For example, 
combining position information shared by social network users with time of day 
gives the ability to advertisers to target market to the right audience their goods. The 
consumers of this type of service would be both large and small businesses. Some 
of the successful services based on DaaS are Fidelitone, a 3PL (third party logistics) 
company; Hoover’s, a business data company; Xignite, a financial data company; 
Urban Mapping, a geographic data company. Fidelitone provides logistics solutions 
to companies specializing in Aftermarket Parts, Electronics, Healthcare, Medical 
Devices, Consumer Goods, Industrial, and Retail products. Hoover’s, a Dun & 
Bradstreet (D&B) company, specializes in making business data available to all us-
ers whether they are looking for new leads or a way to keep their CRM up to date. 
The reputation of D&B, combined with its ability to make available real time data 
via the cloud, makes this DaaS an indispensable service for many businesses. The 
main idea behind Xignite’s business model is that businesses acquire large volumes 
of data from feeds, databases and EDM systems. Many units in a business could 
benefit from this financial data if it is processed quickly and made available to them. 
Xignite apps do just that by storing the data in the cloud once and make the results 
of the data available to various units by customized apps.Urban Mapping provides 
geographic information to businesses and using its popular Mapfluence software

1.6  Supporting Entrepreneurship
they are able to provide essential information to a variety of businesses such as 
health care providers so that they can assess their community penetration.
Testing as a Service (TaaS) is a model that tries to replicate what has been quite 
successful in industrial applications. Companies that develop a particular product 
as an offshoot of a larger development process get the product tested by third party 
companies with expertise in the area. This helps the company to continue to focus 
on its core strengths and at the same time get a secondary product to market. This 
type of service is ideally suited for cloud computing when the item being tested 
is a new software product rather than a physical device. One reason where TaaS 
companies could be vital in the product testing phase is that in today’s rapid de-
velopment process the product life cycle time is getting shorter constantly. That is 
where the need for rapid testing becomes critical. In the case of software products, 
the tester will be able to deploy any type of resource needed in order to complete the 
testing using cloud computing. TaaS is thus truly an entrepreneurial venture which 
provides a small business an opportunity to provide an essential service to identify 
the weaknesses in a proposed service. TaaS also provides the testing company the 
opportunity to take corrective steps that would help fix the weakness. Thus, the 
original developer of the service is not only able to get the necessary testing done 
prior to launch but also have the ability to have a service that will meet the customer 
expectations. Since the capabilities needed for TaaS are very diverse no one orga-
nization could try to invest in all that is needed in order to perform testing and so 
cloud services become quite indispensable. For this reason TaaS is also known as 
On-demand testing.Some variations on what TaaS can provide are:
1.	 Entrepreneurs can serve as consultants to companies on testing because of their 
specialized knowledge in niche areas
2.	 TaaS service could be provided without any restriction on geographical location
3.	 TaaS is well suited for third party testing because the testers need not be fully 
well versed in all aspects of the product being tested
4.	 Areas where TaaS could prove useful are in security testing, performance testing, 
automated testing, and monitoring testing
1.6  Supporting Entrepreneurship
Cloud computing has eliminated the barrier to entry for many entrepreneurs by 
providing the best of what is needed from an IT perspective. This opportunity has 
placed an ever increasing demand on having access to large volumes of data. Many 
datacenters are near their capacity since social media has placed a very heavy bur-
den by generating large volumes of data. This demand has led many data centers 
to look for cloud computing to provide the necessary infrastructure to handle the 
data. Google has developed the Map/Reduce technology that facilitates analyzing 
large volumes of data quickly by chunking a large data set into smaller data sets 
and processing them in parallel in multiple machines. Apache Software Foundation 

14
1  Cloud Computing Evolution
further enhanced this application by developing the Hadoop framework (Hadoop 
2012). These tools, combined with the open source nature of this framework, have 
spawned several businesses to process large volumes of data on a continuous basis 
for large businesses. This application shows the need for both public and private 
clouds. Cloud computing is growing rapidly to support both public clouds and pri-
vate clouds.
Companies like Amazon, Google and Rackspace support public clouds which 
are experiencing explosive growth. The data for this growth comes from internet 
traffic and proliferation of social media applications. The real challenge in meeting 
future computing demands is in providing connectivity to all types of devices—cell 
phones, tablets, laptops, desktops and servers. Given the ability to deploy virtual 
servers, cloud computing is in a better position to meet this challenge. According 
to an Intel study, by 2015, more than 2.5 billion people with more than 10 bil-
lion devices will access the internet, which is more than double that of today’s de-
mand (Intel 2010). In order to manage data creation and access by so many devices 
requires a cloud infrastructure with virtual servers in the order of billion servers. 
These high demands associated with the data center build-outs are necessary to 
satisfy the growing demand. Moreover, success in managing such large volumes of 
data can only be met with the increased efficiency, performance and flexibility of 
cloud architectures.
Large corporations are facing the need for private clouds because of the expand-
ing business demands on enterprise IT. Many data centers find themselves facing 
real limits on storage and access bandwidth. When a business considers the option 
of expanding the infrastructure to meet the growing demand it realizes the many 
challenges it has to overcome in order to make the investment worth it. Moreover, it 
is a time consuming process. This is where cloud computing offers an edge because 
of economies of scale and expertise.
For many companies implementing cloud computing is an evolutionary step be-
cause they will have to give up their traditional control over both infrastructure 
and data. However, it enables the company to realize cost savings along the way in 
implementing cloud services. It is a fundamental shift in thinking and there are chal-
lenges to consider before implementing cloud services. One such instance relates to 
the company managing itself all their mission critical applications as they transition 
into the cloud environment. Another important factor to consider is the protection 
of Intellectual Property (IP) since there is greater potential for loss of data on the 
cloud. Cloud computing is still emerging and many businesses still consider secu-
rity as their major concern in using cloud services. Since one of the requirements of 
cloud services is the ability to automate service provisioning, there should be ways 
to prevent data leakage in a multi-tenant environment. Newer approaches are still 
evolving in cloud services to provide the level of automation required and at the 
same time protect customer data from accidental exposure. This growth period in 
cloud services should also explore ways to provide flexibility and interoperability 
for the many applications that are needed by businesses.
Cloud computing’s acceptance is growing very rapidly and its economic impact 
is expected to grow significantly. For example, Software as a Service application 

15
1.8  Review Questions
services are projected to grow from $ 13.4 billion in 2011 to $ 32.2 billion in 2016 
(Market Trends Forecast 2012). Enterprise Cloud applications are projected to grow 
from $ 22.9 billion in 2011 to $ 67.3 billion in 2016 (IDC 2012). In a related re-
search, Cisco Systems projects that by 2016 global cloud traffic will account for 
nearly two-thirds of all data center traffic (Cisco 2012). These projections show the 
promise of cloud computing. Supporting such growth are newer services introduced 
by Google known as the Google Drive and by Microsoft as the Sky Drive. These 
services provide free storage in the cloud for individuals and businesses, which 
could be expanded for a limited fee. Combined with Cisco Systems’ observation 
of more data getting stored in the cloud there is great opportunity looming for en-
trepreneurs to mine such data for useful information. Facilitating rapid analysis of 
large volumes of data is also facilitated by new services such as Google Analytics. 
Our analysis of the existing cloud services and the prospects for future cloud ser-
vices shows that entrepreneurs have a great opportunity to exploit using the cloud.
1.7  Summary
We have analyzed in this chapter the evolution of cloud computing and traced its 
origins to the original plan by the erstwhile Compaq Corporation. This analysis is 
followed by how cloud computing is a paradigm shift and how it relates to the ear-
lier ways of sharing computer resources.Further, we consider briefly the three basic 
types of cloud services—SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and the four cloud deployment models—
public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, community cloud. These concepts are 
discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. As an extension of this analysis we 
have included other forms in which cloud computing could help, such as Storage as 
a Service, Security as a Service, and Testing as a Service. This chapter also includes

Abstract  Cloud computing’s marquee feature is the availability of all required 
software on the web. The principal service that provides this feature is Software 
as a Service (SaaS) and this is the leading type of service on the cloud. Medium 
sized businesses that have the ability to have computing expertise amongst its work 
force have the option of selecting Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS gives the 
business the ability to choose applications that fit their needs most by selecting 
multiple platforms from the cloud provider. Large and niche businesses have the 
option of selecting only the infrastructure from the cloud provider, thus benefiting 
from the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) option. In this chapter we will high-
light the major benefits and certain drawbacks of these three important services in 
the cloud. Moreover, the cloud provides different modes in which an organization 
could benefit. The four basic modes are: public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud 
and community cloud. Public clouds are the most widely deployed and used by 
all small and medium sized businesses. Private clouds are predominantly used by 
large businesses that need to supplement their data centers in a reliable way. Hybrid 
clouds provide a way for a business to manage certain services in-house and use the 
cloud for some of their customer facing applications. The community cloud serves 
a vertical market such as health care or automotive where the users have some 
common features in their applications. This chapter will address the strengths and 
weaknesses of these four modes of cloud computing. We will conclude this chapter 
with a survey of Storage as a Service that is gaining ground as an important cloud 
service.

2.1  Introduction
Cloud computing is a global technology that is offering businesses of all types an 
alternative way to have an information system for their business. Businesses are 
good at what they do and it is a fact that in today’s competitive world they need 
a reliable computing system to achieve their goals. Traditionally businesses of all 
types developed their own in-house computing system, with or without help from 

2  Basic Cloud Computing Types

external partners. For small and medium sized businesses it is a distraction to have 
to concentrate on having their computing system functional. It costs both time and 
money to manage an information system. When cloud computing system became a 
viable option many businesses decided to use the service. In doing so the business 
has to give up control of the computing hardware that they will be using as well as 
their data. This resulted in natural concern both from security and privacy aspects 
for many businesses.
Cloud computing evolved from the traditional outsourcing model. In this model 
the necessary service is provided by an organization that specializes in that field. 
The contracting organization chooses a specific period for which the service is pro-
vided. Many small and medium-sized businesses, instead of outsourcing their Infor-
mation Systems, contracted with specialists to manage their Information Systems. 
In either case the Information System was under the control of a third party. Often 
the third party handled all associated data as well. Businesses did not have a prob-
lem with this arrangement because of the detailed stipulations spelled out in their 
customized contract with the third party.
The primary attraction with cloud computing for businesses is the ability to have 
a fully functional computing system within a few hours or a few days depending on 
the level of complexity in the chosen system. The cloud computing platform makes 
available all the options such as the type of hardware needed, the service type, ap-
plications needed, and amount of storage, etc. for the customers to select and launch 
their system (Hurwitz et al. 2012). The access to the system for the customer is 
through the internet. Cloud customers who need higher level of protection for their 
communication with the cloud may choose a Virtual Private Network (VPN) con-
nection which is offered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISP connection 
speed determines their communication speed with the cloud service. Speeds such as 
10 Mbps and higher are quite affordable for many individuals and businesses and 
so accessing the cloud computing service via their internet service will not be cost 
prohibitive. Some of the other benefits for a business in using the cloud service are 
the ability to increase or decrease the use of computing resources, access to a wide 
variety of applications without any licensing requirement, pay only for the service 
used, and the ability to have access to high-end computing resources. The most 
important attraction with the cloud service for a business is that the service is avail-
able without the need to maintain and manage the service, which takes significant 
resource and attention away from the business.
Customers can select from a variety of cloud service providers and so there is 
better pricing available and the cloud customer could be located anywhere in the 
world. Many niche services such as payroll processing, human resource manage-
ment and Customer Relations Management (CRM) that are usually outsourced can 
be subscribed to as a service through the cloud. Major cloud service providers have 
invested billions of dollars in their infrastructure with plenty of redundancy built-in 
for higher reliability. Moreover, the service provider is able to provide a 99.9 % ser-
vice uptime guarantee. Cloud computing service comes in a variety of service types 
and deployment models. The most common service types are Software as a Service 
(SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The 

2.2  SaaS
19
most common service deployment models are Public cloud, Private cloud, Hybrid 
cloud and Community cloud. The major cloud service providers are Amazon Web 
Services (AWS), Microsoft Office 365 and Windows Azure, Google Apps, Rack-
space and Salesforce. AWS is the largest cloud service provider globally and it 
offers services such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service 
(S3). Office 365 provides all the office productivity software that many people are 
accustomed to such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint and the Outlook email service. 
Azure provides high-end database and search engine services as well as the Sky-
drive storage service for the consumer and businesses. Google Apps includes all 
the popular software such as Gmail, Google Docs and Google Drive, plus several 
more niche services. Rackspace provides all the basic cloud services, including web 
hosting and the Fanatical Support service for all its cloud offerings. Salesforce is the 
global leader in offering Customer Relations Management (CRM) software over the 
cloud. In this chapter we will discuss the details of each service type and each de-
ployment model in detail. We will also introduce additional service types for cloud 
use that are sought after by businesses.
2.2  SaaS
Today’s cloud computing has three basic types: Software as a Service (SaaS), Plat-
form as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In the simplest of 
terms ‘cloud computing’ has come to embody SaaS. Similar to the IT time-share 
model mentioned in Chap. 1, SaaS provides both the server hardware and software 
to an organization without any of the complications of managing an IT system. The 
simplest example of SaaS service would be email for an organization. The first such 
service was Hotmail from Microsoft in 1996. Prior to Hotmail the email services 
from providers such as America Online and Compuserve were server based. The 
cloud provider benefits from the economies of scale in managing a large infra-
structure because of their strength in that area and is able to provide the necessary 
computing resources to the user, majority of who are small and medium sized enter-
prises (SMEs), at an affordable cost. SaaS leaves the full control of the computing 
system with the provider. SaaS is also known as the On-Demand software because 
organizations choose the software that they need from a whole host of software of-
fered by cloud service providers. The early leader in offering SaaS service was IBM 
in 2003. At that time this service was known as On-Demand software. The term 
SaaS evolved over a period of time and came into vogue in 2005 when Amazon 
launched the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Today, some of the major commercial 
SaaS providers are Amazon, Google, Microsoft and SalesForce.
Managing software such as an office productivity suite of applications requires 
keeping current on the software, the necessary licenses for all users, patch manage-
ment and upgrade on the software. Each of these aspects requires the management 
to devote time and energy. For small and medium sized businesses it is a neces-
sity to have a dependable IT resource but at the same time it detracts them from 

2  Basic Cloud Computing Types
20
their core strengths. For example, a small business focusing on manufacturing an 
automotive part will have to keep up their quality in manufacturing, move the prod-
ucts in the supply chain to the automotive manufacturer and maintain or grow their 
business. For them, to divert their attention from their core strengths to managing 
the necessary IT infrastructure would take a toll. This is where SaaS comes handy 
for small and medium sized businesses. In fact, a service oriented IT department in 
an organization would immensely benefit from changing their focus from deploying 
the various software and maintaining them to managing the results of the various 
applications that SaaS vendors provide.
SaaS evolved as a natural extension on the cloud of the traditional software de-
livery to businesses. In this early approach, SaaS was essentially a single-tenant 
service from the service provider. This shifted the maintenance of the software to 
the cloud provider but did not give the user the benefits of integration from run-
ning multiple applications on the cloud. With the growth of technology today SaaS 
enables the user to work in a multi-tenant environment where the user is able to 
integrate the results from multiple applications on the cloud.
Businesses see the potential of SaaS as a strategic decision that they have to 
take to embrace given the risks involved in losing direct control over their ap-
plications. In the traditional model vendors sold the software applications to users 
for a onetime fee and the users were responsible for the upkeep of the software 
patches provided by the vendor. However, under the SaaS model, the vendor or 
a third party known as the aggregator provides the software application over the 
cloud. In this model the user pays an ongoing fee for use of the software on a per 
user basis without the hassle of maintaining the software. SaaS benefit extends 
to large enterprises as well. However, in this case the enterprise should have a 
software management structure whereby all SaaS applications usage in the orga-
nization must be cleared by a single group so that the organization could plan for 
integrating data from all SaaS applications. In many businesses there is a greater 
need to use both on-premise software and some SaaS applications. Until recently 
businesses were concerned about the security issues associated with the cloud and 
there was some resistance to using SaaS applications. With the widespread use of 
SAS 70 audit features by the cloud service providers many businesses now seem 
to consider SaaS applications because they will have the necessary audit data to 
comply with any requirements.
Organizations find another benefit when it comes to using SaaS. Typically the 
budgeting process in companies requires extensive lead time in order to invest in 
capital expenditure and also requires significant time for IT to implement the new 
application. A reasonable estimate of this time frame is 18 months. On the other 
hand when using SaaS, businesses usually spend less than two months to implement 
the new application and the budgeting process moves into a different area other 
than capital expenditure and speeds up the approval process. This ease of imple-
mentation also has a potential downside. Many units within a business would find 
specialized applications that they need and find it in the cloud and deploy quickly. 
This could lead to mushrooming of applications that a business uses and may have 
difficulty integrating the outputs from these various applications. That is why busi-

2.2  SaaS
21
nesses should have a strategic vision when it comes to using SaaS as a fast solution 
to deploy their plan.
Following up on the theme of the previous paragraph, we look at the details of 
Microsoft Office 365 suite of products. This is a cloud service provided by Micro-
soft that makes available all their leading software products for office productivity. 
The main benefit to a business in using Office 365 is that it not only comes with 
the software that people are accustomed to using in their own computers but it also 
provides storage for the documents created using Office 365. This feature enables 
the user to access their documents from anywhere on multiple devices. Today, with 
the work force being so mobile, access to documents on multiple devices is a must. 
Moreover, some of these devices use different operating systems, such as iPhone. 
Instead of the business trying to manage the software on all devices that their em-
ployees use and from any location, a business stands to gain in cost and manage-
ment time from letting the service provided by a cloud provider such as Microsoft 
using Office 365. Google also provides a similar service using Google Apps. Since 
many users are already familiar with Microsoft products it helps a business to use 
Office 365 both from the availability of the necessary software but also providing 
its work force full access to the documents from anywhere on multiple devices. 
These are important considerations for a business in evaluating a cloud service.
Typically, in evaluating cloud service businesses consider the pros and cons 
with regard to the software applications and the hardware maintenance. As men-
tioned earlier, small and medium sized businesses benefit more from SaaS. The 
service SaaS consists of a variety of software products that a business uses, not just 
office productivity software. So, for this reason a business might have to consider 
other aspects of SaaS when it comes to a multitude of services such as inventory 
control and Customer Relations Management (CRM). The leader in CRM services 
on the cloud is Salesforce.com. This being an independent software, businesses 
will have to evaluate the ease of interoperability between the many software ap-
plications that they choose on the cloud. Thus, Office 365 may not suit all busi-
nesses. In this regard one software that is worth mentioning is Zoho. Compared to 
its major rivals Salesforce.com and Google Apps, Zoho provides a free version that 
could be used by small and medium sized businesses. The approach taken by Zoho 
is worth mentioning as it offers significant integration of multiple types of applica-
tions such as Office products such as email, spreadsheet, inventory management 
and growing the business using easy tools to follow customer leads. Major soft-
ware such as Salesforce.com and Google Apps also offer such integration but at a 
per user cost on a monthly basis which will add up quickly for a small or medium 
sized business.
Web based services such as SaaS should provide greater flexibility in integrat-
ing multiple applications. One such application for many businesses is web based 
forms through which businesses collect valuable information. Application software 
such as for CRM should support integration of information gathered through web 
based services. We emphasized the benefit of SaaS for SMEs in that the business 
can focus on its core strengths and rent IT services from a cloud provider. Given the 
need to support many mobile devices for its workforce, SMEs are faced with the 

2  Basic Cloud Computing Types
22
problem of supporting applications on the mobile devices. Companies like Zoho 
have realized this need and have developed products that will help them remotely 
troubleshoot mobile devices for specialized applications. Besides Salesforce.com 
and Zoho other related CRM products are BatchBook and SugarCRM. Each of 
these software try to provide a niche service such as seamlessly integrating with 
social media in order to follow customer leads that come through email.
When a business controls its IT the benefit is the knowledge the business gains 
in knowing the reliability of the system and its uptime. These are two aspects a 
business must evaluate before deciding on a cloud service provider. In this regard 
the metric to watch is the system uptime. It is measured as number of 9s, for ex-
ample, four 9s uptime means that the service provider guarantees that the service 
would be up 99.99 % of the time. It should be noted that the measure is reported as 
four nines and not four ninths. The four 9s uptime translates to a total down time of 
only 52 min a year. Managing a highly available computing infrastructure is very 
expensive. In order to add one more 9 to the uptime level nearly doubles the cost 
for the cloud provider. The following table summarizes the meaning of multiple 9s 
uptime in terms of the respective downtimes per day, per month and per year. It is 
clear from this table that four 9s uptime provides that a system could be down only 
8 s per day. In order to provide such a high level of reliability the cloud service pro-
vider must have plenty of redundant systems in place. Companies like Amazon Web 
Services and Google have the necessary resources to guarantee such a high level 
of reliability. If a cloud service provider lists in their promotional literature greater 
reliability then the potential (Table 2.1).
We have mentioned here how a customer could assess the service reliability of a 
cloud service provider by checking their uptime level. There are simple commands 
available for the end user to accomplish this. In the Unix/Linux environment the 
command is $uptime and in the Windows environment the command is systeminfo 
| find “Up Time”. Knowing that such simple tools exist based on the operating 
system used, the customer need not take the claims of the service provider at face 
value.
Another major advantage of cloud services is the ability to integrate vertical mar-
ket applications. For example, in health care or automotive businesses, cloud com-
puting can help eliminate redundancy in the deployment of application software for 
all businesses in the industry. Using economies of scale, a SaaS provider will be 
able to provide the necessary common application software to all businesses in the 
same field such as health care. Likewise, in horizontal market applications such as

payroll and customer relations management, cloud computing can help eliminate 
redundancy in the deployment of application software and their management. It 
might appear to be lost revenue for the software vendor because they would not 
be selling their software to many businesses. However, they would still reap the 
benefits of providing the same service to many more businesses through the cloud. 
In this case the software vendor would make up the difference in revenue through 
volume. Moreover, the cloud service would benefit the software vendor in dealing 
with one provider rather than numerous individual businesses.
One drawback in the use of cloud services either for a vertical or horizontal 
market is the potential for data leakage. In either type of market the common thread 
is the application software. When many businesses use the same software for their 
inventory management or customer relations management they all store data in sev-
eral virtual servers that share a single data storage device. When a virtual server 
malfunctions and accesses an area outside of their server then chances are that data 
would be pulled in a readable format. Another related issue is explained in the fol-
lowing scenario. When data is stored in clouds by multiple banks (all using SaaS 
from the cloud provider) then the potential exists to search all those data for a par-
ticular customer based on the Social Security Number as the key. Why is this impor-
tant? If in a major investigation the law enforcement wants to find out the financial 
reach of an individual then cloud facilitates it much easily.
The adoption of SaaS has been rather slow in spite of the many benefits it of-
fers. In the 2008 Forecast survey by Computerworld, many respondents identified 
several reasons for not considering adoption of SaaS in their operations. The main 
reasons given were:
1.	 Security concerns over lack of control
2.	 Need for enhanced bandwidth to access the application and data over the cloud
3.	 Lack of offline access to the application
4.	 Lack of interoperability among multiple applications by different vendors
5.	 Potential for their data getting comingled with others’ data
6.	 Costly Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
Some of these concerns still persist, especially the interoperability and security as-
pects.
We described above a general scenario in which cloud services benefit the soft-
ware applications vendor. We now look at a special case to amplify this command 
further. Oracle is a major database and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) soft-
ware vendor. They have developed Exadata servers with the specific goal of pro-
viding cloud service that combines the benefit of a single provider who is able 
to provide SaaS applications such as CRM and ERP using the cloud. The benefit 
Oracle provides in this case is their maturity in both the CRM and ERP markets and 
their ability to connect these applications using the Exadata servers. Since SaaS 
applications in the cloud require both fast processors and storage, Oracle’s Exadata 
Database machines are able to meet the demand in terabyte level storage and peta 
byte level scalability of applications.

2.3  PaaS
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud based service that gives the subscriber more 
freedom in the choice of computing platform that they want to use. The PaaS user 
must have adequate computer specialists to manage the platform that they sub-
scribe to as opposed to a SaaS user. PaaS brings the same level of flexibility that 
a cloud platform provides with regard to availability of resources and elasticity of 
demand. Just like SaaS, PaaS also fits the pay-as-you-go model. PaaS provides the 
customer a platform, such as the Windows operating system with the necessary 
server capacity to run the applications for the customer. The PaaS cloud service 
provider manages the system for its upkeep and provisioning of tools such as .NET 
and Java whereas the customer is responsible for the selection of applications that 
run on the platform of their choice using the available tools. Thus, the customer is 
responsible for the security challenges associated with the applications that they 
run. For example, a customer running a SQL Server database on the platform should 
be aware of the vulnerabilities of the database system. Hence, the customer should 
have the expertise to manage such applications on the platform used. The benefit to 
the customer is that if their hardware needs change or if they require a Linux/UNIX 
platform for some other applications, then provisioning them takes only a few days 
as opposed to few weeks to make the new system operational. Major PaaS cloud 
service providers are Google App Engine, Salesforce.com and Windows Azure.
In PaaS, the cloud service provider makes available several application “com-
ponents” that the user must put together as needed. This service is somewhat akin 
to building an object from Lego blocks. For example, Google Apps is a PaaS ser-
vice from Google where a user could have storage space, ability to work collab-
oratively with others on textual documents, spreadsheets, presentations and emails. 
Google Apps is free for those in the education domain whereas it is a paid service 
for businesses. With over 5 million business users Google Apps is a well known 
PaaS service. By its very nature PaaS is a complex service that could be managed by 
organizations that have an experienced IT staff. Because PaaS is available through 
the cloud it is highly scalable. Even though PaaS gives the user the freedom to 
choose the applications that run on their platform, the hardware aspect is managed 
by the cloud provider and so the user can expect to have continuous service with 
no scheduled downtime for maintenance on a weekly basis. Companies use PaaS to 
develop and test new applications without the constraints of acquiring the necessary 
hardware.
PaaS is well suited for large companies and entrepreneurs for developing, testing 
and launching new applications based on a variety of platforms. Since the infra-
structure cost uses the pay-as-you-go model many entrepreneurs are able to use a 
variety of platforms for their applications. Given the ease of use for the end user, ap-
plications can be tested in an interactive manner for multiple concurrent users. This 
kind of load testing is a great benefit to developers. Since resources are all available 
over the cloud, the developers could create different interfaces for different types of 
users. Since PaaS users develop their applications on a test platform, testing could 

2.3  PaaS
25
involve sharing applications by multiple users while planning for scalability and 
security. Another benefit of PaaS is that it allows the developer to form distributed 
teams that work concurrently on various aspects of their application and assign 
different users different levels of access and track their usage patterns during the 
testing phase. Thus, PaaS offers a flexible multi-tenant architecture.
One of the key benefits of PaaS is that it supports the complete life cycle of any 
application development. This process would involve providing features that the 
customer should be able to combine in the ways they want and create the necessary 
applications. Such users need not be traditional programmers, rather typical users 
in a practical environment. PaaS features support the ability to collect logs of user 
patterns and identify any problems that occur when a real user tries out a new ap-
plication. It is important for a developer to know that the platform supports Applica-
tion Lifecycle Management (ALM) since it is essential for the developer to know 
that future changes would be easy to implement. With this feature of PaaS in mind 
we recommend that a potential user should evaluate the following aspects before 
deciding on a particular provider:
• Does the platform support multi-tenancy in architecture and applications?
• What Application Lifecycle Management applications are supported?
• What Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are supported?
• Does the platform facilitate scalability?
• What types of log data would be available for the user?
• What programming languages are supported by the platforms?
We conclude this section with the following table that summarizes the availability 
of these features with respect to some of the major PaaS services. One new con-
cept referred to in the table below refers to REST (REpresentational State Trans-
fer) which uses HTTP methods explicitly and is stateless. REST was introduced by 
Roy Fielding in his doctoral thesis at the University of California-Irvine in 2000. 
REST is widely used today in web services. REST uses four HTTP methods: GET,

PUT, POST, and DELETE. REST is an alternative to SOAP (Simple Object Access 
Protocol) based web services. For example, when the browser makes a request for 
GET or PUT the response could be a PDF file, an image or an XML output. For this 
reason REST is preferred in web services because it preserves the state of what is 
being transferred to the recipient (Fielding 2000) (Table 2.2).
2.4  IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides the customer the same features as PaaS 
but the customer is fully responsible for the control of the leased infrastructure. IaaS 
may be viewed as the computing system of the customer that is not owned by them 
(Combs 2012). Unlike PaaS, IaaS requires the organization to have the necessary 
people with extensive computing expertise. IaaS is also known as “utility comput-
ing” since the organization needs the computing resources but does not invest in it 
directly but acquires the resources just like it would acquire a utility such as elec-
tricity and water. The IaaS customer would be responsible for all security aspects 
of the system that they use except physical security, which would be handled by 
the cloud provider. Amazon, Rackspace, Xerox and IBM are examples of IaaS pro-
viders. Typical use for IaaS is when a developer builds an application on a virtual 
machine of the cloud service provider and customizes the application to the needs 
of various customers by running them on multiple virtual servers. In this case the 
large organization is able to take advantage of the availability of virtual machines 
and manages the VMs for running their specialized applications. Of the three ser-
vices IaaS is the most expensive and it is used by large corporations. The use of IaaS 
could be a supplement to the in-house computing resources of the organization. As 
described above, IaaS could also be deployed for certain applications using a VM 
environment. We summarize in Table 2.3 the major providers of these three types 
of cloud services.
The major strength of IaaS cloud service is that it extends the capabilities of large 
organizations in enhancing their IT resources. Many organizations are able to mod-
ernize their IT infrastructure using IaaS without the capital outlay needed to expand 
their corporate IT. Since organizations pay only for the cloud resources they use, 
the IaaS architecture provides the traditional benefits of the cloud and yet gives the 
customer more control over the security aspects of the applications that run on their 
virtualized environment. The scope of IaaS is many-fold. Organizations could use 
IaaS for pure computing power, which would be hardware and software. IaaS is also 
used by organizations for a specific purpose such as storage, security, or networking 
(Gartner Magic Quadrant 2013).
The real benefit to large organizations using IaaS is in acquiring raw computing 
power without the capital outlay. Since the organization controls what the infra-
structure is used for it has the best of both worlds—access to computing resources 
as well as control over the infrastructure. The main reason for acquiring such addi-
tional computing power is to find ways to integrate multiple applications. For exam-

2.4  IaaS
27
ple, when the CRM application runs on SalesForce.com web site, the hardware the 
organization needs to integrate a part of the output from SalesForce.com to another 
application running in another cloud service provider may not be available to the or-
ganization. These applications need not be IaaS as well. They could be PaaS or SaaS 
applications. Thus, the organization will have plenty of need to test many scenarios 
of integration and it might need additional hardware unhindered by corporate secu-
rity policies that might prohibit moving data across platforms. The IaaS provides 
the necessary infrastructure under the control of the organization with respect to its 
operation. In a similar way, the organization might have temporary needs to store 
large volumes of data for retention purposes for a specific period. Once again, the 
control the organization has in managing the external storage is what makes it ac-
ceptable for the organization. In this case the organization has to look at the nature 
of storage—is it shared in a multi-tenant environment or is it dedicated to a single 
user. The latter type of storage is more expensive but yet it gives the organization 
the necessary data concerning compliance requirements. The one drawback in this 
scenario for storage as a service using IaaS is that the organization becomes respon-
sible for backup and recovery of any stored data. If the organization, on the other 
hand, opts for a third party storage as a service then the backup and recovery are 
taken care of by the cloud service provider.
We listed above that security and networking are also aspects under which an 
organization could use IaaS. The most challenging part in using IaaS would be 
with respect to security. Usually security aspects require full control over the infra-
structure. With the use of IaaS for security, the organization will have to cede the 
physical security of the infrastructure to the cloud service provider. This is not a 
major aspect and since the cloud service providers have a reputation to uphold they 
would be careful to provide the necessary physical security for the infrastructure. 
The organization should then be able to use their personnel to device the necessary

access security policies and their implementation. The cloud provides the ability 
to monitor many aspects of the service and thus have more data points to evaluate 
security. On the networking side, the true benefit from IaaS comes with the ability 
to deploy a variety of hardware from multiple locations to connect the various seg-
ments of the organization spread over a large geographical area. Since the service 
is a pay-as-you-go model, the ability to deploy the necessary infrastructure is facili-
tated by IaaS.
It is worth noting that many organizations find the IaaS service as instrumental in 
reducing the pressure on their infrastructure. In a survey conducted by Loudhouse 
Research in USA and UK of IT decision makers found a very high level of satisfac-
tion among the users for the cloud service that they were getting. One key finding 
of this survey was that 73 % of the users reduced their infrastructure costs because 
of the availability of cloud services using IaaS. This survey further reinforced other 
beliefs about the use of cloud services (Loudhouse Research 2010). The specific 
areas here are:
• Lowered the cost of IT use 57 %
• Better control of data 58 %
• Overall better organizational performance 61 %
• Increased end user experience 72 %
Some additional information gained from this survey of 502 IT decision makers 
reveals the following. The significance of the survey results is that it was conducted 
by Mimecast through personal interviews of the decision makers (Fig. 2.1).

2.5  Public Cloud
29
We conclude this section with a consolidated view of these three types of cloud 
services and their level of deployment in the market place along with their complex-
ity (Fig. 2.2).
2.5  Public Cloud
The three types of cloud services discussed in the previous sections aim to meet the 
customer requirements at different levels of engagement in managing the comput-
ing hardware and software. This has a direct correlation to the size of the organi-
zation in choosing the type of cloud service. Related to the service types are the 
service deployment models. These deployment models can be classified as Public 
Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud. In this section we will 
address the most popular of these models, the public cloud. In the following sec-
tions we will discuss the other three deployment models. Small and medium sized 
businesses typically use the public cloud as their primary computing source. Large 
corporations use the public cloud as an addendum to their in-house computing re-
sources. In a public cloud model the organization could choose any one of the three 
types of services discussed earlier.
One of the benefits of cloud computing is in its ability to provide both computing 
and storage services as the need arises. In a classic example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon 
highlighted the rapid growth of Animoto company in requiring computing power 
that grew from 50 servers to 3500 servers over a three day period (Bezos 2008). 
Many companies need the ability to have on demand storage as the amount of data 
gathered is increasing rapidly. According to an IDC study the projected data growth

by 2020 will be in the order of 40,000 Exabytes. Putting this number in the more 
commonly understood unit of gigabytes, it would be the equivalent of 40 trillion 
gigabytes (IDC 2012). Given this explosion of data and the need for large corpora-
tions to store large volumes of data, cloud computing is the natural solution. The 
same study by IDC points out that by 2020, the IT investment will drop from $ 2.00 
to 0.20 per gigabyte. Given this reduced investment scenario by companies in IT 
infrastructure and the need to store very large volumes of data, a public cloud would 
be a natural choice since the cost of public cloud is relatively cheaper than a private 
cloud.
All of the benefits of cloud computing discussed in Section 3 apply to the public 
cloud deployment model. Small and medium sized businesses are able to subscribe 
to basic computing hardware and software in the public cloud. The pay-as-you-go 
model of cloud helps these businesses to concentrate on their core strengths and use 
the necessary cloud resources as the need arises and pay only for what they need. 
For large organizations there is the inevitable demand fluctuation and so invest-
ing in computer hardware to meet the peak demand is not the optimal solution. In 
such situations the public cloud comes handy for large organizations to use. Large 
organizations are able to use the public cloud for their non-sensitive data. One of 
the important things being considered by large organizations with regard to storage 
needs is the explosive growth of data. Data centers are key to the success of large 
organizations and the storage needs of data centers are met by using public cloud. 
The IDC Study estimates that in the case of large organizations data growth would 
be by a factor of six by 2010. Since then the technology has significantly improved 
in facilitating information sharing and rapid dissemination of geo location data 
through the use of social networks. To keep pace with this type of storage need will 
put a dent in corporate budgets. Associated with data storage is the need for ensur-
ing security, privacy and availability of the stored data. Since the storage solutions 
offered by Amazon Web Services through their S3 (Simple Storage Service) cloud 
service addresses the security, privacy, backup and availability aspects, many large 
corporations use the S3 cloud service. The pricing model used by Amazon makes 
it attractive for all types of businesses to consider cloud storage as it costs less than 
10 cents per gigabyte of storage. The 2011 Forrester Research Report points out that 
using cloud storage is 74 % cheaper than storing data in-house. (Reichman 2011) 
We will address the potential drawbacks of public clouds later in this section.
Public cloud offers several benefits. Foremost among these is the simplicity of 
use. Organizations that need computing services from a public cloud service pro-
vider such as Amazon Web Services is able to sign up for the service online easily. 
The provider offers both hardware and software resources that the customer needs 
on a pay-as-you-go model. The customer is able to benefit from the automated man-
ner in which resources are allocated and deallocated. The service is available in a 
reliable manner on a 24 × 7 basis (Li 2011). The only requirement for the customer 
is the availability of a high speed internet connection. Many public cloud service 
providers carry compliance certifications such as HIPAA, SAS 70 and PCI. These 
certifications would help the customer provide the necessary documentation for 
their own compliance requirements.

2.6  Private Cloud
31
One of the major concerns for many businesses is the public cloud security 
(KPMG 2013). It is a fact that public clouds host multiple tenants in one server us-
ing the virtualization concept. Customers feel that lack of control over the hardware, 
combined with the possibility of someone else accessing their data is a cause for 
concern. Since access to the public cloud is via an internet connection, customers 
are limited to the speed that they get through their ISP. Traditionally businesses will 
have the ability to depreciate their assets, including computer assets. However, use 
of cloud computing prevents the customer from depreciating any computer assets as 
they do not own the infrastructure. Sometimes customers feel that they are locked in 
to a cloud service because the cost of moving to a different provider is high due to 
lack of standards. At this time cloud service is still maturing and so many providers 
use proprietary technology to store data. Consequently, any customer migrating out 
of one provider to another provider will have difficulty in the usability of their data 
due to storage formats. This is a bigger problem for small businesses which tend to 
use SaaS more than PaaS and IaaS. Medium and large businesses that use PaaS and 
IaaS have a higher level of control over the storage aspects and so moving to a dif-
ferent cloud provider would not be that difficult. Overall, the benefits that the cloud 
offers far outweigh some of the disadvantages mentioned above.
2.6  Private Cloud
The concept of private cloud implies some form of ownership. It is true that the 
customer has higher level of control when using a private cloud. This is an ex-
pensive service compared to the public cloud. It would be affordable only to large 
businesses both from the infrastructure perspective and the system management 
perspective. There are four types of private clouds. In a typical private cloud the or-
ganization hosts the cloud in one of their data centers behind the corporate firewall. 
The architecture is akin to the use of intranet whereby the organization leverages 
the techniques of internet but limits the access to the content to internal employees 
only. In this sense the business uses the cloud technology but limits the users to its 
internal employees. The second type of private cloud is one that is managed by a 
third party provider. In this case the organization still owns the infrastructure in one 
of their data centers but management of the facility is with a third party. In this case 
the private cloud is called ‘managed private cloud’ signifying that the infrastructure 
belongs to the organization but managed by someone else. In the third model, the 
‘hosted private cloud,’ a cloud service provider provides the infrastructure needed 
and manages that infrastructure. The benefit to the customer in this case is that scal-
ability, demand elasticity and availability are guaranteed by the cloud service pro-
vider and because the servers are not shared with other organizations there is greater 
security. The fourth model is the ‘Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).’ The VPC service 
is offered by a traditional cloud service provider in a multi-tenant environment (Mi-
crosoft 2012). In this section we will look at all these types of private clouds.

2  Basic Cloud Computing Types
32
One of the major benefits of cloud computing is the economies of scale whereby 
the cloud service provider is able to leverage the servers through the use of vir-
tualization. The benefit to the organization is the availability of large computing 
resources that they can use and pay for as needed. The organization stands to gain 
in the form of no investment in the infrastructure cost. Using the private cloud 
described above some of these benefits is lost because the organization has to in-
vest in the infrastructure. Moreover, the infrastructure availability does not scale up 
quickly as in a true cloud. The use of the term ‘cloud’ in ‘private cloud’ is justified 
by the use of cloud concepts such as virtualization. Thus, the organization using the 
private cloud first overprovisions the infrastructure with the anticipated demand in 
mind and sets it behind the corporate firewall. Access is limited to the employees 
of the organization and much automation is provided in the form of enabling virtual 
servers on their physical servers. Since the organization controls both the infrastruc-
ture and access to the systems it is able to better meet the compliance requirements 
and have a higher level of security than in a public cloud. In this scenario the orga-
nization is able to manage the private cloud because it has a large IT workforce that 
could be dedicated to managing the private cloud. All the expenses of managing an 
information system would be applicable along with the cost of the infrastructure 
that requires overprovisioning. Examples of such private cloud users would be large 
organizations such as IBM, Cisco and Verizon.
In the second model, the ‘managed private cloud,’ a third party provides the 
management of the cloud service on internally owned infrastructure. The managed 
cloud service provider uses virtualization technology, thus eliminating the risk of 
multi-tenancy. There is a general myth that private cloud would be more costly 
compared to the public cloud. However, multiple studies have shown that it is not 
the case. For example, in a 2011 study, James Colgan points out that the cost of 
public and private cloud are almost the same, with the private cloud coming slightly 
below that of public cloud in cost. Here the comparison involves a fully private 
cloud and a leased private cloud with a public cloud (Colgan 2011). Colgan’s analy-
sis shows that assuming a 50 % server utilization rate the cost for a private cloud 
is comparable to a public cloud. Likewise, in an EMC study in 2013, Chuck Hollis 
reports that in a typical usage, private cloud cost would be approximately $ 28,000 
per month while for the public cloud with a single availability zone the cost would 
be approximately $ 33,400 per month (Hollis 2013). The same study also points out 
that if the usage pattern is more storage intensive then private cloud is cheaper than 
public cloud. On the other hand, if the usage pattern is more compute intensive then 
public cloud is cheaper than private cloud. Two of the prominent third party provid-
ers in managed private cloud are Hostway and Peer1 Hosting. Both these companies 
offer VMware based solutions for management.
In the third model, the ‘hosted private cloud,’ the cloud service provider provides 
dedicated servers to the organization, thus eliminating the concerns of multi-tenan-
cy. This type of service offers all the benefits of cloud computing such as scalability, 
demand elasticity, availability and security. Hosted private cloud is also referred to 
as Leased private cloud. In this model the organization pays a slightly higher cost 
for the use of dedicated servers. Since the cloud service provider could not expect 

2.7  Hybrid Cloud
33
to allocate these dedicated servers for other purposes during idle times, the cus-
tomer’s utilization rate would be considered 100 % of the server time, irrespective 
of any lower percentage use. In this context we compare the cost details provided 
by Colgan and find out that the public cloud would be significantly cheaper than 
the private cloud because the infrastructure for the public cloud would be available 
for other uses whereas the private cloud infrastructure would not be usable for other 
purposes during any idle times. Some of the hosted private cloud providers are 
Amazon EC2 Dedicated, IBM SmartCloud Enterprise, and Rackspace Cloud.
In the fourth model, the ‘Virtual Private Cloud,’ the cloud service provider pro-
vides virtual servers on multi-tenant hardware with VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
access to their customers. Thus, the customer has certain added level of security in 
their access to their virtual servers. This service is much less expensive compared 
to the other three types of private clouds but more expensive than the public cloud. 
Subscribers choosing VPC should use the IaaS type of cloud service since in that 
case they would control all settings in their virtual servers. Since access to their 
virtual servers is via VPN they get higher level of security than in the public cloud. 
In this case the third party would be a bonafide cloud service provider with all the 
advantages of the cloud service such as scalability, demand elasticity, availability, 
and storage. The organization accesses the cloud using a VPN connection thereby 
assuring security. Some of the Virtual Private Cloud service providers are Amazon 
VPC, VMware, Microsoft Private Cloud, IBM SmartCloud Enterprise Plus, and 
Rackspace RackConnect.
In the private cloud, a large organization which has a data center to manage, is 
able to use large amounts of storage and computing power dedicated to just their 
organization only. The private cloud facilitates the large organization to handle de-
mand elasticity for computing similar to the public cloud provider using server 
virtualization. However, in the case of storage the private cloud provider needs to 
invest just for that purpose. This is not a major hurdle since organizations always 
have their data storage needs grow and any capital investment in storage would be 
worth the expense for the growing needs of the organization.
It is worth noting that the EMC Corporation, a multinational company special-
izing in data storage, predicts that by 2016 nearly 96 % of all Enterprise applica-
tions would either run on a private cloud or a Virtual Private Cloud. Likewise, of all 
general applications nearly 61 % of them would run on a private cloud versus 39 % 
that would run on a public cloud. Thus, the above cost observations concerning the 
private cloud are important considerations for a business to consider in selecting a 
cloud service provider.
2.7  Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid cloud is a natural evolution from the two service models discussed in the 
preceding two sections. The hybrid model uses both proprietary computing re-
sources that the organization manages directly and the public cloud for some of the 

2  Basic Cloud Computing Types
34
computing requirements, especially the ones with varying demands on resources 
(Bhattacharjee 2009). The typical hybrid cloud uses the Infrastructure as a Service 
type to build the public cloud part of the hybrid cloud. Since the organization con-
trols the use of the infrastructure on the cloud they have total freedom to move ap-
plications between on premise and off premise. By having the public cloud compo-
nent in the architecture the hybrid cloud offers the cloud advantages of scalability, 
availability, demand elasticity and pay-as-you-go model. Hybrid cloud is suitable 
for large businesses or niche businesses with a compute intensive system that would 
experience demand fluctuation (Piff 2012). Major cloud providers such as Amazon, 
VMware and HP all provide hybrid cloud service.
Most organizations today need the benefits of a hybrid cloud as new applications 
emerge and they need a way to test their viability before incorporating them with 
their systems and processes. For this reason the hybrid cloud management should be 
an extension of the private cloud management so that the organization could move 
applications seamlessly between the two parts of the hybrid cloud. Typically orga-
nizations are wedded to controlling their resources. With hybrid cloud technology 
using the Infrastructure as a Service model is able to offer the control the organiza-
tions desire. As discussed in the previous section many organizations prefer the use 
of private cloud for security and control considerations. The cost analysis discussed 
earlier shows that the private clouds are actually cheaper than the public cloud. 
Since the private cloud users are mostly large businesses the cost benefit advantage 
would not translate to small businesses.
One of the key benefits of hybrid cloud is the ability of the organization to keep 
on premise the sensitive applications and move to the public cloud the other ap-
plications. Using this blended approach the organization is willing to give up some 
control on its IT resources. It is worth noting that IT organizations tend to develop 
all the resources that they need. However, in the case of cloud technology the IT 
departments are bypassed by business units in acquiring the third party resources 
that they need in order to meet their goals. This reality has introduced the ability 
to test third party applications thereby opening up the opportunity to embrace new 
methods. In this way one could say that hybrid cloud helps future-proof the organi-
zational IT by providing an avenue to introduce new techniques. This blend of pri-
vate and public clouds clearly opens up the possibilities for application developers 
to come up with new methods that could be tested on a public cloud and eventually 
get adopted by private clouds.
Finding acceptance of hybrid clouds requires having the tools for the different 
development groups, IT personnel, and Quality Assurance team members to com-
municate well. One such tool is Eucalyptus, the open source software. The appeal 
of Eucalyptus is its compatibility with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is a 
significant plus since much of the public cloud offering is dominated by AWS and a 
hybrid cloud needs the ability to interact well with AWS standards. The other open 
source software available for hybrid cloud is HyperTable. The HyperTable concept 
was developed by Google. The primary goal of HyperTable is to implement a scal-
able and distributed storage system that would deliver high performance. The main 

2.8  Community Cloud
35
application envisioned for HyperTable is database processing. Already the database 
approach is migrating from standard SQL to NoSQL. Traditional database lookups 
involve keeping a hash table without the data itself being ordered on a key. In the 
HyperTable approach the data is stored in order based on a particular field such as 
URL. HyperTable uses a multi-dimensional table of information for rapid lookup. 
The HyperTable is implemented using a compiled code thereby providing greater 
performance speed. In a way this concept is similar to the MapReduce concept de-
veloped by Google whereby parallel processing is enabled using multiple servers 
simultaneously. With the cloud technology providing servers on demand organiza-
tions that adopt the hybrid cloud approach will be able to leverage the cloud to use 
the HyperTable. Being an open source software the organizations need not outlay 
significant funding for HyperTable (HyperTable 2013).
In a hybrid cloud environment of internal IT and use of public cloud computing 
causes some management control problems. The cloud itself consists of integrators, 
aggregators, third-parties, and vendors. Often businesses face a vendor lock-in for 
services because there are no universal standards governing the cloud technology. 
This concern is significantly alleviated by the use of IaaS service model. New ser-
vices and niche players constantly emerge in cloud computing but lack of portabil-
ity from one cloud provider or vendor to another makes it difficult to take advantage 
of future opportunities. The pace of change in cloud computing is difficult to pre-
dict. It is becoming increasingly evident that hybrid cloud is businesses could rely 
on because it offers the necessary control for part of their systems held internally 
and benefit from the cloud technology for non-sensitive applications. Another ma-
jor concern of hybrid technology deals with jurisdictional constraints. Conflicting 
controls and legal requirements are a constant challenge since the cloud provider in 
one jurisdiction may not be aware of the legal requirements in another country or 
region. Also, the security controls of the vendor may not be in sync with the internal 
requirements of the business.
2.8  Community Cloud
The community cloud concept evolved when businesses in a particular sector such 
as automotive, energy, financial and health care realized that they need specialized 
applications that are not applicable to other sectors. The community cloud offers the 
benefits of public cloud computing but restricted to a particular industry segment 
and the security features of a hosted private cloud. Since the members of the com-
munity cloud are leading companies in that industry there is the mutual respect and 
protection for the services offered through the cloud. For example, a community 
cloud for the health care sector could focus on HIPAA compliance and the associ-
ated need for patient data protection and privacy. A traditional email service such 
a Gmail or Yahoo Mail will not be able to provide the differential security needed 
by certain types of email. For example, a communication between two doctors on 

2  Basic Cloud Computing Types
36
a community cloud would not be part of the general email community and as such 
will be able to provide greater protection for the content. People might be already 
aware that some financial companies make their confidential communications 
available only through their network to which the customer must login. However, 
the financial company will be able to alert the customer of the available communi-
cation through the public email system such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail. There are two 
basic types of Community Cloud models—Federated and Brokered. The underly-
ing assumption is that businesses in the same sector only participate in this type of 
cloud. In the Federated model companies belonging to the same sector participate 
in the community cloud whereby any unused computing resource in one organiza-
tion is used by another member organization on demand. Figure 2.3 illustrates a 
Federated Community Cloud. In the Brokered model a trusted third party serves as 
the broker and interfaces with the various community cloud members. The broker 
is responsible for procuring the various services needed by the industry sector and 
makes them available to all the members. Figure 2.4 illustrates a Brokered Com-
munity Cloud.
The community cloud is a closed system, available only to member organiza-
tions. The specific sectors identified earlier are large enough to manage a com-
munity cloud. An in depth analysis of the community cloud concept shows that it 
evolved from the techniques developed by vertical market segments, especially the 
automotive sector. The major benefit to the organizations belonging to the commu-

nity cloud is that they will have greater cost savings in using the applications needed 
in that sector. The Brokered model supports this feature better than the Federated 
model.
The Federated community cloud model has the benefit of sharing the comput-
ing resources of member organizations when they are idle. However, the liability 
issues with regard to such processing are not settled, especially when there is a 
service outage in the middle of a processing. Another issue that is also open is to 
the responsibility of the member organization about keeping up the system and how 
the time share will be paid for. An example of a Federated Community Cloud is the 
joint project between Mt. Sinai Hospital of Toronto and the Canadian Government 
to make available a fetal ultrasound application to 14 area hospitals. This example 
highlights the benefits of a community cloud because hospitals generate 15 TB of 
data annually and this data growth is projected to grow at 31 times by 2020. When 
hospitals have such large volumes of data it becomes cost prohibitive to store all 
that data internally. Instead, using a community cloud the hospitals are able to not 
only save on storage costs but also share data with other hospitals.
The Brokered model is much better in handling the liability issues in the com-
munity cloud. The Broker is responsible for contract settlements with the pro-
viders, provide the necessary trust for the members for use of the system, and 
resolve disputes. Broker will also be able to provide the necessary data for the 
members for meeting their compliance obligations. In the case of cloud services 
one concern is how the cloud service provider will be able to mitigate the risks. 
The members need not be concerned about this aspect in a community cloud with 
a Broker present because the Broker will be able to take care of the risk mitiga-
tion. Moreover, the Broker will be able to provide several additional value added 
services. For example, the financial services industry requires low latency com-
munication because they deal with buy and sell orders for stocks traded in a stock 
exchange. There are several Brokers who serve the community cloud segment of 
cloud computing. Some of them are Optum Health Cloud by United Health Care 
for the health care sector, IGT Cloud by International Gaming Technology for the 
gaming industry, and Global Financial Services Cloud by CFN Services for the 
financial sector.
Cloud computing as a whole is maturing rapidly and there are many service 
providers available globally. It gives vendors an opportunity to distinguish them-
selves by focusing their services in the community cloud for a specific sector. 
This availability of a large number of vendors in the community cloud segments 
by industry provides an opportunity for the industry members to take advantage 
of the community cloud offerings with the added security features not present in a 
general cloud offering. In this connection it is worth noting a report by the major 
international consulting firm McKinsey in which they identify opportunities and 
constraints based on the number of service providers in that vertical segment. The 
report’s main theses are captured in Fig. 2.5 below (Stuckey and White 1993).

2.9  Storage Services
Earlier in this chapter we considered the three basic types of cloud services—SaaS, 
PaaS and IaaS. Analyzing the cloud computing usage landscape it is easy to note 
that cloud is heavily used for storage by many companies. The cloud storage serves 
two purposes for many companies. First, companies need to backup data and it is 
economical to use cloud for this purpose as the data is stored in encrypted form 
thereby providing the company the necessary security protection. Since the data 
backup is needed for a specific period of time companies could sign up for certain 
amount of storage such as 1 TB and reuse the space as needed. In this case there 
is no need to access the stored data on a regular basis and so the expectations for 
this data are purely for retention for a specific period of time. This is the most 
used type of storage service on the cloud, especially for disaster recovery, off site 
data protection and archiving. Second, companies could use the cloud for real time 
storage, also known as standard storage, as well. In this case companies have to 
look at the read/write speed of the cloud provider. If the company requires low 
latency in accessing the data then it would be more costly than medium and stan-
dard latency. The standard latency would be 10 ms for a gigabyte of data access. 
Since cloud storage offers the same type of benefit with regard to the pay-as-you-go 
model, companies may choose to follow the pay-as-you-go model. However, since 
the amount of storage needed is predictable, companies may opt to sign up for a 
certain amount of storage for a specific period of time such as one year at a lower 
cost than the pay-as-you-go model cost. Typically, Amazon and Google charge less

than 10 ¢ per gigabyte of storage per month for standard storage. If the storage is 
used for backup only with no frequent access needed, then the cost comes down to 
about 7 ¢ per gigabyte.
Amazon Web Services has a specialized storage service called Simple Storage 
Service (S3) that is very popular. Typical latency rate for onsite data is 5 ms. So, 
companies use onsite storage for data that is needed often and with low latency. 
Other types of data that could tolerate medium to high latency such as 25 to 100 ms 
are moved to the cloud. The reason for higher latency rates in the cloud is two-
fold. First, data is accessed over the internet and so there are intermediate routers 
and switches that have certain inherent delays built-in. Second, companies have 
a standard bandwidth access such as 100 MB over their corporate network to the 
cloud. For these reasons the 100 ms latency rate is not considered high. To improve 
performance cloud service providers use the deduplication concept. Deduplication 
means that only one copy of a data is stored and all other applications that require 
the same data point to the storage area for this data. Deduplication is extremely use-
ful in email applications when an attached file is distributed to multiple users via 
email. Instead of storing the attachment in every Inbox, the deduplication allows 
one copy of the file to be stored in a common storage area and all the Inboxes that 
need this file simply point to this common storage area. Thus, storage service in the 
cloud not only provides basic storage but also provides efficient storage. Besides 
Amazon’s S3 storage service, two other important storage services are Microsoft 
Windows Azure Blog and ATT Synaptic Compute as a Service.
Multiple studies have shown that corporate data storage in the cloud exceeds 
60 %. Hybrid approach to data storage is becoming popular whereby large compa-
nies store most frequently accessed data onsite and the other data in the cloud. The 
data growth in companies is significant and with branch offices of a large company 
storing data onsite makes it more expensive and inefficient. For this reason many 
companies are switching to hybrid storage in the cloud. Gartner Research projects 
that by 2018, 80 % of all corporate data will be on the cloud, with the rest being used 
for mission critical applications onsite. Gartner Research further emphasizes that it 
is not easy to compare the cloud storage costs with onsite storage because there are 
several other factors that go into the calculation of Total Cost of Ownership for the 
onsite storage (Gartner Research 2013).
2.10  Summary
In this chapter we have looked in detail the three cloud computing types—SaaS, 
PaaS, IaaS. In this analysis we pointed out the benefits and drawbacks of these 
services and their popularity and how they support security in the cloud. Also, we 
considered the four cloud deployment models—Public, Private, Hybrid and Com-
munity. Through this analysis we were able to identify the strengths of each service 
model and give examples to illustrate that all these models are popular. The cost

discussion on public cloud versus private cloud clearly showed that contrary to peo-
ple’s perceptions, the private cloud is more affordable and cost effective. However, 
one should note that the private cloud option is available only to large companies 
because of the cost outlay needed in order to consider private cloud. We concluded 
the chapter with a look at the cloud storage. It is clear from this discussion on stor-
age that many companies use cloud for data backup, archiving or disaster recovery. 
It is estimated that a large percentage of corporate storage would move to the cloud 
by 2018 based on the access needs, data availability and cost considerations.

Abstract  Cloud computing has become very popular because it offers a wide range 
of computing services to a large group of businesses and individuals. Businesses 
have many choices to select a cloud service provider. The process of selecting and 
deploying the cloud service requires careful thinking on the part of the business to 
weigh the benefits against the possible drawbacks such as lack of control over the 
computing resources, applications and data storage. In this chapter we discuss in 
detail the many benefits and drawbacks of this service. Small and medium sized 
businesses tend to benefit from cloud computing because they are able to use sophis-
ticated computing services without a large cash outlay. Individuals benefit from the 
ability to store and share information using the cloud. It is important for businesses 
to evaluate the various cloud service providers against their offerings and their fit 
with the business. The analysis in this chapter highlights the things that a business 
should look for in contracting with a cloud service provider. Even though cloud ser-
vices are known for their high reliability and availability, over the past 5 years there 
have been several well-publicized outages. Because of the outages several other 
niche service providers who depended on other major cloud service providers were 
unable to deliver their service. We conclude this chapter with a detailed analysis 
of several cloud outages over the past 5 years that have eroded the confidence of 
businesses on the availability aspects of cloud computing as a 24 × 7 service. This 
discussion highlights the importance of service availability to build trust.

3.1  Introduction
Cloud computing as a technology is growing rapidly worldwide. Numerous small 
and medium sized businesses that could not afford to have an attractive web pres-
ence are now able to offer sophisticated services to the customers over the internet 
thanks to cloud computing. As discussed in Chapter 1, cloud computing technology 
came into being only in 2006. In less than a decade this technology has attracted 
the attention of the common consumer. This technology is benefiting individuals 
in sharing their photos and videos with family and friends. Companies like Apple, 
Dropbox, Flickr, Google, Microsoft and others offer free cloud storage for indi-

viduals to share content with their friends and family. A recent report by Strategy 
Analytics shows that music and video dominate the usage by individuals in posting 
the content on the cloud for sharing with others (Strategy Analytics 2013). Apple 
is leading the way in music content with an overall share of 27 % of the users. 
Other leading providers of cloud storage are Dropbox (17 %), Amazon (15 %) and 
Google (10 %). From an individual user’s perspective, Google’s YouTube service is 
the leader in video content sharing on the web. This type of service alone is used by 
millions of individuals worldwide, making cloud computing an easy to use global 
technology.
The primary benefit of cloud computing for small and medium sized businesses 
is financial in nature. Investments necessary to have a reliable IT service has kept 
many prospective entrepreneurs from creating online ventures. On the web, busi-
nesses large and small look alike. Cloud computing is providing entrepreneurs the 
opportunity to try their ideas out, with IT services no longer holding them back as a 
barrier to entry. The major beneficiaries of cloud computing are small and medium 
sized businesses as this new concept provides them an opportunity to try out high-
end services with no up-front cost, allowing them to use the pay-as-you-go model. 
Large businesses also use cloud services a lot, but because they have the necessary 
financial and people resources their use of cloud service is at a high end, which we 
will discuss in detail later in this chapter.
Looking at the growth of cloud computing over the past decade, it is easy to 
notice that this service is popular because the users need not acquire any new infra-
structure. The basic requirement is the availability of access to the internet, which 
many people around the globe have today. It is worth noting that people tend to 
use a technology if it is simple to use. For example, the popularity of browsers 
is attributed to their availability on all computers stored today. Likewise, on the 
security side, many internet users support eCommerce because the SSL encryption 
is native to the browsers and the customer need not do anything special to acquire 
this software application. Moreover, in many developed countries the availability 
of mobile devices has skyrocketed and the telecommunications providers are able 
to use technologies such as LTE (Long Term Evolution) to offer high speed data 
service over mobile devices. This feature has made the cloud service even more 
useful to the customers. These are some of the driving forces behind the popularity 
of cloud computing.
The leaders among cloud service providers are Amazon, Google, Rackspace, 
and Microsoft. Even though all these providers are US based, cloud computing is 
a global technology and there are numerous niche cloud service providers in every 
region of the world. We discussed in detail the three major types of cloud services 
in Chap. 2. These are Software as a Service, Platform as a Service and Infrastructure 
as a Service. Software as a Service is used largely by small and medium sized com-
panies. This accounts for nearly 60 % of all cloud services. For many SaaS is syn-
onymous with cloud computing. With BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) becoming 
popular among businesses, many small and medium sized businesses are trying to 
take advantage of the cloud using BYOD. Platform as a Service and Infrastructure 
as a Service each have a market share of around 18 % each. The rest of the cloud 
market place is shared by other niche providers focusing on a specific aspect of

cloud such as security. Major cloud service providers target consumers more than 
enterprises. Cloud service providers such as Microsoft, Google and Dropbox offer 
free services for storage up to a certain level. Invariably the customers will need 
more storage and so they are highly likely to sign up for paid storage. In some cases 
higher level of availability is guaranteed for premium services that people sign up 
for. Small and Medium sized businesses need specialized services related to data 
backup and recovery as well as integration of several of the services that they use 
over the cloud. Customers pay for these services on a recurring basis, providing a 
revenue stream for cloud service providers. This is one way free services bleed into 
paid services for cloud service providers.
Large enterprises stand to benefit more from cloud computing, although of a 
different nature. Large enterprises manage data centers and the IT paradigm shift 
referred to earlier mean more in the context of accessing data from the data centers. 
In this context private clouds have been introduced where the benefits of storage 
management and elasticity in demand for computing services are the key drivers. 
Moreover, the cloud technology also offers high level of reliability and availability 
of systems without significant capital layout. Often, the benefits of cloud comput-
ing are realized by taking a hybrid approach. The hybrid approach gives the large 
organizations the ability to manage their IT centers and at the same time expand 
their computing capacity without large capital investment by utilizing the cloud 
resources. This is especially useful to meet seasonal peak demands with hybrid 
clouds. Organizations with seasonal high demands that could benefit from hybrid 
clouds are in the entertainment industry around holidays, sports networks with on-
demand service and tax service providers.
3.2  Advantages of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing has many benefits to offer. In this chapter we will look at the de-
tails of these benefits and how they benefit businesses of all types. Businesses plan 
to use cloud computing primarily because they could transfer all the management 
issues associated with managing an information system. From the perspective of 
small and medium sized businesses this boosts the ability of the business to focus on 
their core strengths and enjoy all the benefits of having an information system avail-
able on demand. Closely related to this is the matter of having the computer system 
available for business use all the time. This is known as service availability. This is 
measured in system uptime, which in today’s terms means 24 × 7 availability. Cloud 
service providers tout their system uptime using a simple metric called ‘number of 
9s.’ This means that customers expect the cloud computing system to be available 
almost non-stop. The three 9s availability means that the service provider guarantees 
that the computer system would be up 99.9 % of the time. This is a significantly large 
uptime. When a company owns its own Information System it will have to make 
available significant resources in order to have the three 9s uptime. This is a costly 
phenomenon. It is important to realize that when a company owns its own Informa-
tion System it has to bring the system down every week for routine maintenance. But 

46
3  Understanding Cloud Computing
when the service is moved to the cloud, as a user the expectation for system uptime 
increases. From the details presented in Chapter 2, the 99.9 % uptime translates to 
a total downtime of nearly 1½ min per day. Cloud companies strive for at least four 
9s, i.e., 99.99 % system up time for their cloud service. The four 9s uptime translates 
to a maximum downtime of at most 8 seconds per day. In order to guarantee such 
a high uptime the cloud service providers have to invest heavily in redundancies 
and automation in service allocation. When an individual organization’s computing 
system is down it only affects that one organization and its customers, which usually 
is a smaller number. However, when a cloud service provider system is down, since 
they serve numerous customers, it has a much larger impact. As we will discuss later 
in this chapter on outages, the unknown for the customer is the total downtime, as the 
cloud service provider is unable to provide this estimate during an outage.
Another major benefit of cloud computing is its ability to provide limitless server 
capacity. This is also known as service elasticity or demand elasticity. Cloud com-
panies architect their system using the concept of virtualization to make limitless 
servers available. Virtualization means a single physical device is partitioned into 
multiple virtual machines (VMs) and made available to the customer. The main 
physical device is called the ‘host’ and each VM is called a ‘guest.’ Each guest 
requires minimum 2 GB storage. Each VM can be a virtual server. If the host has at 
least a Quad core processor with at least 1 TB hard disk space, then ten virtual serv-
ers can be created on the single host, each with 100 GB storage allocated. For to-
day’s workloads the 100 GB storage allocation is small. In reality the number of vir-
tual servers per host depends on the type of workload planned per server. Typically 
the hosts come with at least 32 TB hard disk capacity and four multicore processors. 
The goal of this illustration is to point out that a single host could provide multiple 
servers since the typical server utilization is only around 20 % of its capacity. Even 
with all servers functioning at 50 % of their utilization capacity the load demand will 
not be taxing the host’s processors. This illustration is intended to show that using 
the server virtualization scenario any cloud customer is given the appearance that 
the number of servers that they have access to is limitless. This point is well illus-
trated by the experience of Animoto company that experienced tremendous service 
growth that it required to go up from 50 servers to 3500 servers over a 3-day period 
(Bezos 2008). This was made possible by Amazon Web Services for Animoto. Busi-
nesses consider having limitless computing power availability an important aspect 
in opting to use cloud computing versus managing their own computing system. 
We mentioned earlier that this benefit is called demand elasticity. This means that a 
business could use a certain amount of computing resource at one time and release 
part of that at other times when the demand for such a resource is less. This ability 
to ramp up or down in the need for computing resources is what makes cloud com-
puting attractive to many businesses (European Union Report 2009). This is known 
as scalability and businesses benefit significantly from this feature. An associated 
benefit here is the sustainability of the computing resource being used.
Cost is an important metric for all businesses. Cloud computing supports the 
pay-for-what-you-use model. This is also known as pay-as-you-go model. Given 
the need for demand elasticity discussed above, the pay-as-you-go model enables 
the customer to not invest in expensive computing hardware that they use rarely. 

3.2  Advantages of Cloud Computing
47
From the cloud service provider perspective they are able to pass on the cost bene-
fits to the customer because of economies of scale. This benefit of cloud computing 
makes it a utility for the customers. The cloud service provider has the advantage of 
choosing to locate their servers in an area of the country where the cost of electric-
ity is lot less. For example, the per kilo watt hour rate in northwest USA is about 
8 cents whereas the rate in northeast USA is about 18 cents (Energy Information 
Administration 2013). Because of the advancements in communications technology 
location of cloud servers does not pose any service constraints since all customers 
access their cloud infrastructure via the internet.
Cloud service architecture is distributed for availability and reliability. Because 
of this feature cloud services are able to provide 24 × 7 customer support. From the 
customer perspective the services offered are location agnostic. Further, the cus-
tomer is able to use any device to access the cloud service. For example, businesses 
that manage their own information system know that they have to manage a differ-
ent set of APIs in order to make the information available on mobile devices and 
PDAs. Since cloud service providers cater to the needs of a large and varied set of 
customers they make the necessary infrastructure investments to make their ser-
vices accessible through all types of devices. From the business perspective this is a 
major plus because of the prevalence of BYOD sentiment among many employees. 
Thus cloud computing supports the increased mobility of the workforce. As seen 
from the Animoto example above, cloud services significantly reduce infrastructure 
deployment time.
Businesses that use the cloud service know that they have the ability to change 
their service mix rapidly. For example, a customer needing to test one of their ap-
plications on a different platform such as Mac or Linux will be able to get their 
resource quickly and test their application. This type of agility is supported by cloud 
service providers and valued very much by the customers. We discussed in the last 
chapter three types of cloud services – SaaS, PaaS, IaaS. The PaaS service enables 
the customer to choose any platform that they need to either offer or test their ser-
vices. Thus, cloud service supports multi-platform availability. The availability of 
all types of resources on the cloud enables the customer to reduce their capital 
expenditure significantly and shift it to operating expenditure. Since all aspects of 
management of the information system for the business is shifted to the cloud it 
frees up internal resources in the organization.
Cloud services are used extensively by businesses for storage. Some of the as-
sociated actions needed with storing data is backup and security. Businesses should 
protect the stored data by using encryption. The encryption key should be kept 
internally by the business. One common problem with cloud storage is the pro-
prietary format used by the cloud service provider in the absence of global stan-
dards. Because of this many businesses are locked-in with the provider. Instead, 
businesses could contract with a third party specializing in storage whereby the 
customer preferred application data will be preserved in that application format. 
This helps during retrieval of such data in the form of speed. Cloud services also 
help with third party integration of some of their services. For example, a company 
using a third party for payroll service would find it easy to integrate their internal 
data for payroll with the payroll service since they will be providing similar service 

48
3  Understanding Cloud Computing
to several other businesses as well over the cloud. This cloud aspect would be a cost 
saver for businesses.
Businesses tend to look at the various components of their business from the 
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) perspective. For example, if they were to host their 
own computing system then it requires not only infrastructure but also experienced 
people to manage the system. Thus, the cost of managing a computing system ex-
tends beyond the infrastructure costs and so using cloud service significantly low-
ers the TCO. Moreover, businesses are able to have access to more advanced web 
services such as online chat, online credit card processing and integrated web site 
for the business. When the demand for more cloud based services arise it becomes 
easy to acquire the new resources and implement them quickly. Since much of this 
is done under user control, implementation is quick and easy. For example, a busi-
ness requiring additional computing power and storage space during the tax season 
is able to acquire these services over the web and release them when the demand 
wanes. The best feature of cloud in this regard is the high degree of automation 
used where by the service requests are fulfilled immediately by the cloud service 
provider. Businesses pay for the services that they use. However, if the demand 
for a particular type of service such as storage is needed for a specific period of 
time such as a year, then the cloud service offers subscription based pricing for the 
extended duration. The use of cloud also helps the cloud service provider to offer 
additional specialized services required by several small businesses through their 
Software as a Service. Cloud becomes a focal point for several small and medium 
sized businesses to find additional opportunities for collaboration with other service 
providers. For example, a business focused on providing custom furniture needs a 
way to get their product to the customers and in this case they can collaborate with 
a transportation company using the cloud service to be a partner.
Overall, it is important to realize that the use of cloud service has numerous 
benefits to offer the businesses, the foremost being service availability on a 24 × 7 
basis, unlimited resources, meeting demand elasticity, pay for what is used, access 
to high-end services and sustainability. Because of server virtualization, businesses 
are able to request on demand many servers and have them deployed immediately. 
Besides the infrastructure provided, the cloud service also provides several appli-
cations such as Microsoft Office 365, Google Apps and the Customer Relations 
Management software by Salesforce.
3.3  Drawbacks of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is widely accepted as a new approach to using information tech-
nology in a cost effective way. In the previous section we have highlighted the many 
benefits of cloud computing. In this section we will discuss in detail the drawbacks 
of cloud computing. The purpose of mentioning these drawbacks is for the customer 
to be aware of the issues associated with cloud computing. These will help the 
customer choosing to use cloud computing to incorporate the factors that might be 
problematic for them in the contract.

3.3  Drawbacks of Cloud Computing
49
Multiple surveys of cloud users have consistently shown that cloud security is 
the top concern for all cloud customers (Intel 2012). This concern stems from mul-
tiple layers. We will look at the security concern from these various aspects that the 
customer focuses. The primary concern for many users is the loss of control over 
the hardware and data (Hashizume et al. 2013, Onwublio 2010, Zissis and Lekkas 
2012). By design the cloud infrastructure is to be accessed using the internet. Cus-
tomers who are accustomed to having the computing infrastructure in-house feel 
that since they are not aware of where the hardware is they have a feeling that it may 
be insecure (Mather et al. 2009). This is a false assumption because the cloud ser-
vice providers, given their size and technology deployed, have adequate resources 
to provide physical security for their hardware and provide additional electrical 
power protection (Cloud Security Alliance 2011).
The second concern is about the location of data storage in the cloud. Cloud 
service provider is responsible for storage and backup of data. The service provid-
ers deploy enough redundancy to guarantee a high degree of service availability. 
In order to achieve this, the service provider has to choose locations that are geo-
graphically apart. This inherent design feature makes it difficult for customers to 
know where their data is stored, not just they are available when they need it. Some 
countries require that businesses must store customer data within the country. This 
is because of differing legal requirements in countries with respect to privacy pro-
tection. European countries and Canada have explicit laws that require data to be 
stored within the country. The primary reason cited for this is the concern that any 
data stored in US could be within the reach of US government because of PATRIOT 
Act (Ars Technica 2011).
The cloud security concern extends to state governments as well. When data is 
stored in a central location there is greater risk of the data being stolen. When such 
a data loss occurs it is massive in scale. Because of this some states such as Mas-
sachusetts and Nevada have passed laws that require protection of data pertaining 
to their residents when stored in the cloud. Other states enacting similar laws are 
California, Virginia, Iowa and South Carolina. These laws require that the cloud 
service providers take adequate precautions to protect the data. Even though there 
is no federal law requiring data protection for data stored in the cloud, the state laws 
described above pertain to residents of those states. These laws would apply to all 
businesses that provide service to residents of these states. Even if the business is 
not based in one of these states they must still comply with the data protection and 
as such the reach of these laws essentially make them applicable to the entire nation. 
One precaution such a business could use involves encryption for stored data. Cus-
tomers would also benefit by choosing an encryption of their own before their data 
is stored in the cloud. In this scenario the customer should be able to safeguard the 
encryption key in their internal system. Since SaaS applications on the cloud handle 
data in the clear, any business using an encryption scheme to store data must present 
the data in clear for use by the application. Srinivasan (2014a) discusses these and 
other details in his paper on security for cloud computing.
One of the reasons for customer concern about cloud security is multi-tenancy 
of customers on cloud servers. Cloud service providers offer virtual servers to cus-
tomers by providing computing power using servers that host multiple clients. The 

50
3  Understanding Cloud Computing
concern is that because data belonging to different customers reside on the same 
physical server there is a possibility that such data could be accessed intentionally 
or accidentally by other customers. Data that persists on systems after their use 
is known as data remanence. Potential hackers could subscribe to a large amount 
of storage space on a virtual server with the idea of accessing data that remains 
in the storage area after use by another customer. This violates the confidentiality 
aspect of an information system for clients. This is exacerbated by the popularity 
of Software as a Service (SaaS) on the cloud. With SaaS, multiple clients using the 
same third party software could discern more information from accidental access to 
other clients’ data on the same physical server. Furthermore, cloud service providers 
handle data in clear in their SaaS offerings. Earlier we considered encryption as a 
possibility but small and medium sized businesses that use SaaS cloud service will 
not have the financial resources to handle encryption.
Customers who choose cloud service opt for this service because of the need to 
have service available at all times. To a very great extent cloud service providers 
are able to provide 24 × 7 service availability but at times the service experiences 
outage that extends beyond the acceptable limit for the service uptime guarantee 
promised. We review some of the major outages in cloud service later in this chap-
ter. Another drawback is the cost savings to customers by using cloud service. Most 
of the customers, especially small and medium sized businesses, use SaaS cloud 
service. Without the capital investment expenses for IT systems, cloud customers 
benefit initially. Studies have shown that this benefit extends for the first 2 years 
of a service contract for SaaS. Beyond that period customers pay more for cloud 
service than what it would cost them to host the service internally (Ward n.d.). 
The primary reason for this is that the business cannot depreciate the cost of IT 
infrastructure since it does not own them. Gartner Research reports that SaaS ser-
vices are not purely for use when needed and rapid deployment alone. Most SaaS 
applications require a predetermined level of commitment from the customer and 
certain specialized applications would take a significant time to become available 
for use on the cloud. These realities should be taken into account when selecting 
cloud service.
Cloud service’s popularity is based on its availability over the internet. Cloud 
customers need not acquire any specialized hardware or software in order to use the 
cloud service. This simplicity of access over the internet adds to the security con-
cerns because the internet is not designed with security in mind. Cloud customers 
can overcome this drawback by using the Virtual Private Network (VPN) service 
offered by the telecommunications provider. However, this adds to the cost of cloud 
service and so small and medium sized businesses will not be able to afford the 
VPN service.
Two other aspects that are also considered as drawbacks in the use of cloud com-
puting relate to trust and compliance. Trust requires the provider to have well de-
fined policies that follow known standards. For example, the cloud service provider 
should be able to provide the customer with third party certifications as to their 
service controls in the form of SAS 70 Type II Audit statement. Additional certifica-
tions to the ability of the service provider to protect the hardware and software for 
HIPAA and SOX compliance would help build trust. The service provider should

51
be able to provide the log data for the customer in an automated manner so that the 
customer can meet their obligation for compliance requirements.
We conclude this section with Table 3.1 in which we summarize the major con-
cerns about the cloud service discussed above. The level of the concern varies with 
the size of the business. Large businesses which have additional resources to man-
age their won computing centers are much more concerned about using a cloud ser-
vice than small and medium sized businesses. Small and medium sized businesses 
are more concerned with the cost of service than sharing the service on the same 
server with other businesses.
3.4  Essential Components for a Cloud Contract
Cloud services are here to stay. More and more businesses, especially small and me-
dium-sized businesses, depend on cloud computing heavily. In this section we will 
highlight the important factors that a cloud customer should consider before decid-
ing on a cloud service provider. Over the past 8 years numerous cloud service pro-

3  Understanding Cloud Computing
viders have emerged, with the goal of providing several niche services. The industry 
is handicapped by the absence of global standards for cloud computing even though 
the service is truly global in nature. It is important to recognize that a provider who 
claims to be a cloud service provider is indeed one such. This is important because 
there are many service providers who focus on storage or file sharing only and do 
not own any infrastructure of their own. They lease their infrastructure from major 
service providers such as Amazon Web Services and offer a niche service. Thus, a 
customer must first verify whether a service provider has their own infrastructure 
in offering the cloud service or depend on another service provider. It is perfectly 
legitimate to use such a service if it would meet the business needs. There are prec-
edents for this type of service in the energy and telecommunications sectors.
It is important to note who the major cloud service providers are and what they 
have to offer. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google App Engine, Microsoft, Rack-
space, Apple, SalesForce, Dropbox, and IBM are important cloud service providers. 
Of these major service providers, AWS has the largest market share by providing 
cloud service under SaaS, PaaS and IaaS types as well as the deployment models of 
public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud. The two major services of AWS are 
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service (S3). Google App En-
gine provides PaaS and IaaS services besides the popular Gmail service. GoogleD-
ocs is an application service that provides standard office products such as word-
processing, spreadsheet and presentation software. GoogleDrive provides a popular 
file sharing service. It is also integrated with GoogleDocs so that documents could 
be edited in GoogleDocs format. Microsoft through its Windows Azure platform 
provides PaaS service. Its Office 365 web service integrates basic office products 
like Word, Excel and PowerPoint as a SaaS service. Microsoft’s SkyDrive provides 
cloud storage and integrates with its basic Office Suite for editing documents. Rack-
space is a global cloud service provider that focuses on superior customer service 
for all its cloud offerings. The other major cloud providers focus in one or more 
of these areas. For example, Apple’s focus is on music using iCloud. SalesForce 
focuses on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application only, with an 
associated social networking called Chatter. Dropbox has been a pioneer in cloud 
storage for file sharing. Over the last year it has grown exponentially with an addi-
tional 100 million users. Given the vast infrastructure that AWS has, Dropbox uses 
AWS S3 service to store the actual files of its 200 million users. Dropbox’s nearly 
10,000 servers are used to store the metadata of its users for the billions of files be-
ing stored. IBM focuses on providing managed cloud service.
By its very design cloud service works over the internet and so any customer 
with access to the internet will be able to sign up for cloud service. The speed of the 
internet connection often decides the response time with the cloud service because 
the cloud service providers have the ability to match the communication speeds of 
most Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In Table 3.2 we summarize the main fea-
tures to look for in such a service.
A potential customer considering cloud computing as an option either to supple-
ment their internal computer information system or to use as their primary informa-
tion system should consider the essential features described above. Whether the 

3.4  Essential Components for a Cloud Contract
53
business is small, medium or large, once using cloud computing, its availability 
all the time is very critical. For this reason the contract should spell out clearly 
the financial remedy in the event of a failure to uphold the system availability. As 
mentioned in Chapter 1, a guarantee of system availability at four 9s only allows 
for a total downtime of 52 min per year, including any routine maintenance times. 
On the security side, the service provider should be able to identify all their internal 
controls for system management, all privileged users with access to customer data 
and the level of multi-tenancy planned for the servers. In order to build trust with 
customers the cloud service provider should obtain SAS 70 Type II Audit certifica-
tion and the like to show that their internal controls work and they are compliant 
with system management policies. The customer should be able to try out the sys-
tem prior to signing the contract to test the ease of use of the system. Among the ser-
vices that a customer might need would be SaaS applications. If this is the primary 
goal of the customer then they should find out what predetermined levels of service 
guarantee are expected from the customer. As mentioned earlier, the cloud comput-
ing service is a pay-as-you-go model but yet the cloud service provider expects the 
customer to use a minimum level of access and service. This is important for the 
customer to know because it involves cost commitment. If SaaS service is planned 
the customer must be aware that the SaaS service is cost effective for them only for 
2 years. So they should plan accordingly in the contract as to the continuing service 
cost beyond the 2 year period.
Customer needs vary widely when it comes to applications. The potential cus-
tomer must carefully evaluate the available applications to see if they would meet 
their needs. If additional applications are needed then the customer must be able to 
get an estimated time duration by which the application would be available on the 
cloud. As discussed earlier it might take a significant amount of time for the cloud 
Table 3.2   Features to look for in cloud service
Feature
Requirements
Availability
Service availability on a 24 × 7 basis is important. This is measured by a unit 
such as three 9s (for 99.9 % availability) or four 9s (99.99 % availability). 
In order to provide such high availability the provider has to maintain 
extensive infrastructure with redundancies.
Security
Internal controls in place to support security best practices. Data pertaining to 
third party audit of system for protecting hardware and software.
Ease of use
Well tested interfaces that are connected to service provisioning in an 
automated manner. Customer should be able to handle demand elasticity 
through allocation and deallocation.
Feature Set
Customer should be aware of all the different types of services such as on 
demand computing, support for basic cloud types and different deployment 
models, storage and device independence for access.
Mobile Access
All services offered through the cloud should be accessible through the differ-
ent types of mobile devices
Support
Technical support through multiple channels such as web, phone, chat, email
Compliance
Support for customer’s need to acquire necessary system data such as login 
data for all users, system uptime information, system patch updates, any 
security vulnerabilities

3  Understanding Cloud Computing
service provider to make available any specialized software. For many businesses 
application availability on mobile devices is important. Even if the business may 
not need it for their employees, businesses should make their information accessible 
on mobile devices. This requires the cloud service provider to make the necessary 
changes to the content in order to make them available on mobile devices. Cloud 
computing introduces many new types of risks and so the cloud customer will be 
faced with the need for technical support. For this reason the contract should in-
clude appropriate response time in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Finally, 
customers may have the need to comply with certain laws such as the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX). 
In order to meet the compliance requirements the customer might need log data per-
taining to system access and the system management information. Such data should 
be easily available for customers in an automated manner. Before deciding to use a 
particular cloud service the customer should consider all these aspects and decide if 
the cloud service will be able to meet their needs.
3.5  Major Outages
Cloud service provider’s computing system is a very large system with multiple 
redundancies. Over the past five years several of the large cloud service providers 
have experienced service disruption or in layman’s terms service outage. In this sec-
tion we will explore the details on these service outages and the important lessons 
learned both for the service providers and the customers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud service provider in the world 
with popular offerings such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage 
Service (S3). On April 21, 2011, AWS experienced significant service latency in its 
Virginia data center. AWS has eight data centers around the world for storage re-
dundancy. With three data centers each in US and Asia Pacific region and one each 
in Europe and Latin America, AWS provides EC2 and S3 service worldwide. Each 
region consists of multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone consists of 
multiple Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes. The Virginia data center, during a rou-
tine system maintenance and upgrade, encountered a system management error due 
to erroneous routing. This human error caused the system to not respond for service 
requests from major businesses. The outage lasted nearly 4 days. Amazon provided 
10-day service credit to all affected businesses (Amazon 2011). This outage showed 
the vulnerability of many businesses that depend on a single cloud service provider. 
In 2012, the Virginia data center was affected again in June and October by utility 
power failures due to thunderstorms and failure of backup generators. The Amazon 
outages affected large businesses such as Netflix, Instagram, Pinterest, Foursquare, 
Quora and Reddit.
Gmail is Google’s popular email service that is used by over 425 million users 
globally. Gmail is a free service but is also part of Google’s premier GoogleApps 
service. When an outage occurs in Gmail, even if it is for a very short time, it has 

3.5  Major Outages
55
significant impact on users because of the number of users involved. Gmail experi-
enced several outages in 2008 that lasted as much as 30 h. Microsoft suffered a ma-
jor outage in its Sidekick application in Fall 2009. This outage, which lasted nearly 
1 week, Microsoft lost all data as well from the Sidekick application that helped 
users access email, calendar information and personal data through a cell phone. 
This service was provided by T-Mobile and it issued credits of up to 3 month data 
charges. The Microsoft email service, Hotmail, also suffered an outage at the end of 
2010 that lasted up to 3 days. In this case the outage was caused by programming 
error. These email outages show that the errors are caused by humans.
Another global cloud service provider is SalesForce.com. This company pro-
vides internet-based CRM service to thousands of companies worldwide. The 
company’s service experienced an outage in January 2009 that lasted less than an 
hour but impacted over 177 million transactions worldwide. Likewise Terremark, 
a global colocation and cloud hosting provider with its 13 datacenters worldwide, 
experienced an outage in its vCloud Express service in March 2010 for 7 h and a 
more recent outage in October 2013 in its data center that affected the Healthcare.
gov web site for several hours. Another significant cloud outage was with the Go-
Daddy.com web hosting service. GoDaddy hosts 5 million web sites and manages 
50 million domain names. On Sept. 10, 2012 it had an outage that lasted 6 h and was 
caused by corrupted data in router tables in its internal systems.
Rackspace is a global cloud service provider with a special focus on customer 
service called Fanatical Support. Rackspace had multiple outages in 2009, some 
resulting due to power problems. The outages in its largest data center in Dallas oc-
curred in June, July and November 2009. In December 2009 the problem was due 
to a routing loop problem between its Dallas and Chicago data centers. In January 
2013 Rackspace had a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that affected 
its email servers for a brief period of time, causing communication outage with its 
customers.
Dropbox revolutionized file sharing using cloud storage in 2007 when it was 
founded. Since then the company has grown to more than 200 million users world-
wide and numerous businesses globally that subscribe to its Dropbox Business ser-
vice. Dropbox users store one billion files daily and access their files using 500 mil-
lion mobile devices. Dropbox uses nearly 10,000 servers to store file metadata and 
store the actual files on AWS S3 servers. In 2013 Dropbox suffered multiple out-
ages, some due to problems with AWS S3. In some instances the outages lasted over 
15 h. One disturbing fact is that Dropbox is not willing to share the cause for the 
outages so that customers could take alternative steps to protect their content avail-
ability (Dropbox 2013).
Cloud customers, in spite of much frustration over outages, continue to depend on 
cloud computing. They believe that with good communication from the cloud ser-
vice providers they will be able to plan for actions during outages. The major cloud 
service providers decided to improve communication with the customers through 
the use of dashboards that provided real time updates on their cloud services. We de-
scribe next some of these dashboards and the information that they convey. Amazon 
Web Services has created a dedicated web page called Service Health Dashboard 

56
3  Understanding Cloud Computing
with system update on all its cloud services. The data for this page comes from au-
tomated data feeds from the various cloud services within Amazon. This Dashboard 
features data by Service Centers in order for customers to know about the status of 
the storage location that they had selected. This is a direct result of Amazon to build 
trust with their customers by providing with automated system status information 
following several outages (Amazon 2013). Google, which also had multiple outages 
over the past 5 years, has created an Apps Status Dashboard web page with real time 
information about the status of all its Apps products, including Gmail. Its visual is 
not as useful as other Dashboards from Amazon and Rackspace because it is all 
blank when there are no problems reported (Google 2013).
Microsoft has taken a slightly different approach in providing the status infor-
mation for its cloud services. In a brief Dashboard called Service Status, Microsoft 
provides the status information on all its cloud services without providing any ad-
ditional detail (Microsoft 2013). Then it has more detailed system information on 
each of its major products such as Windows Azure, Office 365, etc. that are accessi-
ble by the user account and specific to a data center. From the general user perspec-
tive this information should be publicly available to all without having a Microsoft 
cloud service account (Microsoft 2013). Rackspace maintains a real time System 
Status web page with automated data feed from their servers. This information is 
not as detailed as Amazon’s but certainly provides trust building information to the 
customer. This is in response to several outages over the past 5 years that resulted 
in loss of some customer trust due to lack of real time system information during an 
outage (Rackspace 2013).
We summarize the major cloud outages over the past 5 years and their known 
causes. This information is presented in Table 3.3.
3.6  Trust Enhancers for Cloud Service
Trust is a critical aspect of cloud service. Software applications running on the 
cloud expect the users to trust their applications for proper handling of customer 
data. The problem arises here when an application, due to lack of strong authenti-
cation requirements, introduces additional risks while handling sensitive data. The 
most popular type of cloud service is SaaS. The way SaaS applications handle data 
is in the clear. Consequently the cloud service providers have to develop methods 
to protect their infrastructure from external attacks. Conveying this information to 
the customers in a transparent way helps build trust in their service. Building trust is 
a time consuming process. In this section we will review several recommendations 
that would enhance customer trust of cloud services.
An effective way to build trust is to develop transparent policies that help the 
customers manage their core areas of strength. In this regard the cloud customer 
needs data pertaining to customer access of any information that they have on the 
web. By making this information available in a proactive way the cloud service 
earns the trust of cloud customer. Another important area of concern for customers 

3.6  Trust Enhancers for Cloud Service
57
is security. The cloud service provider not only should protect customer data but 
should also communicate the controls that they have in place to protect the customer 
data and processes. The use of encryption for stored data helps alleviate some of the 
security concerns for customers.
Cloud service providers should strive to have in place mature processes and in-
ternal controls that meet the industry standards in health care and finance. Validat-
ing the processes and controls should be done through a third party that can provide 
SAS 70 Type II Audit certification. Additional certifications that the cloud service 
provider could seek are in HIPAA, SOX and GLBA. If the service provider is able 
to have these certifications then it becomes easy for the cloud customer to trust the 
cloud service more. Also, it would help in the customer meeting their compliance 
requirements.
One core aspect of cloud computing is the control of infrastructure by the cloud 
service provider. In order to enhance customer trust the cloud service provider 
should be able to document the uninterrupted chain of service provider control over 
the application interfaces to the infrastructure. Cloud service providers use the vir-

tualization technology extensively resulting in multi-tenancy both for computing 
power and storage. Tools such as Hy Trust that combine virtualization technology 
with protection of cloud infrastructure facilitate customer trust. Thus the goal of 
cloud service provider should be to incorporate trust building tools in their cloud 
service. Another important area for building trust is the availability of system as per 
the service agreement. Even though the cloud service providers take extraordinary 
precautions to provide uninterrupted service, the fact of the matter is that all major 
cloud service providers have encountered service outages for extended periods of 
time that violate the service agreement. Providing cost credit to the customer helps 
with trust but the focus should still be in having uninterrupted service.
We conclude this section with a set of recommendations for best practices that 
enhance customer trust (Srinivasan 2014b). These are:
1.	 Building customer trust requires making relevant log data available to customers 
on demand and in an automated manner
2.	 Identify the list of employees at the cloud service provider with privileged access 
to networks
3.	 The cloud service provider obtains industry recognized compliance certifica-
tions from regulators and government
4.	 Cloud service provider should make available audit data of their systems
5.	 When an incident such as cloud outage or a denial of service attack happens the 
provider should have well established disaster recovery procedures
6.	 Cloud service provider’s uptime claim should be independently verifiable
7.	 Cloud customer should have the ability to choose their data storage locations 
from among the service provider data centers
8.	 Access to newer encryption technologies provide a higher level of security for 
customer data before they leave their control
3.7  Summary
The primary focus of this chapter has been in bringing forth the basic building 
blocks of cloud computing. After a review of these building blocks we discussed 
the benefits cloud computing has to offer. This discussion included well known 
examples of cloud services such as email that are benefiting a large number of cus-
tomers worldwide. In order to present a balanced view of cloud computing we dis-
cussed extensively the many concerns with regard to cloud computing. Considering 
together the benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing it is clear that the benefits 
far outweigh the drawbacks. In this context it is worth noting that when health 
care services are offered in a rural setting, the beneficiaries are more interested in 
receiving the health care for a better quality of life than getting concerned about the 
possible privacy violations of having the health care information on the cloud. We 
followed up with some of the major outages that occurred over the past 5 years in 
cloud services. A closer look at these outages clearly showed that cloud services

are as vulnerable as other services because there is a human element to it and errors 
are bound to creep. In some of these outages the service providers were affected by 
natural disasters that interrupted the power supply for a large part of a region. We 
pointed out how many of the service providers have learned the importance of com-
munication with their customers during an outage. This has resulted in dashboard 
data being made available over the web concerning the availability or otherwise of 
the various cloud services offered by the provider. Finally, we discussed the impor-
tance of sharing information with the customers in order to build trust. Trust build-
ing takes time and the service providers must keep their customers informed of the 
best practices that they are implementing.

Abstract  Cloud computing is popular today because of the reliable services pro-
vided by major companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Rackspace and 
Terremark. In order to provide reliable cloud computing service the provider must 
invest large sums in infrastructure. Their architecture includes several redundan-
cies. Each of these global service providers have several data centers spread all 
over the world. These data centers help cloud consumers meet their governmental 
requirements that cloud data must reside within the country or in the region. More-
over, these distributed data centers facilitate storage redundancy and help with low 
latency response. Also, these providers offer some or all of the three types of cloud 
services—SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. Besides these cloud service providers (CSPs), there 
are also several niche cloud service providers such as Salesforce, Apple, VMware, 
Dropbox and SoftLayer. These companies focus on specific services such as Cus-
tomer Relations Management (CRM), music distribution, virtualization, storage 
and bare metal servers. Another set of businesses focus on providing third party 
coordination of service for businesses needing cloud service. In this chapter we 
describe the services offered by the major cloud service providers, niche cloud ser-
vice providers and highlight the important role that these third party facilitators 
provide and how small and medium sized businesses could benefit.

4.1  Introduction
Cloud computing is a global phenomenon today. Most of the major cloud service 
providers are U.S. based while some of the niche cloud service providers are located 
in Europe, Australia and Asia. These cloud service providers have distributed data 
centers all over the world. The primary reasons for placing these data centers in 
various parts of the world are to meet some governmental requirements about their 
citizen’s data not leaving their region or providing low latency service globally. In 
order to provide low latency, i.e., faster response time, the cloud data should be 
closer to where the cloud customers are located. The distributed data centers also 
serve the purpose of geographic separation for storage backup. Moreover, some 

62

of the U.S. laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the disclosures about the NSA 
surveillance programs have resulted in many governments requiring that their citi-
zen’s data be located outside of U.S. Such requirements apply to Canada and coun-
tries in the European Union. Europe has Safe Harbor Agreement with U.S. which 
gives confidentiality protection for data stored in U.S. Besides the U.S.-Europe Safe 
Harbor Agreement, Switzerland has enacted additional privacy requirements, espe-
cially given their banking regulations (U.S.-EU Safe Harbor 2000; U.S.-Swiss Safe 
Harbor 2008). Thus, a major concern for many cloud customers is where their data 
is stored and how it is protected from governmental intrusion.
Cloud service providers have the ability to provide computing service at an af-
fordable cost. For customers the cost savings alone is not enough. The service pro-
viders have to earn the trust of the customers. That is why knowing where the data 
will be stored and how the data will be handled are important for cloud customers. 
At this time there are no accepted global standards for storage or security aspects of 
cloud service. Because of that some customers are hesitant to use the cloud for fear 
of provider lock-in. Cloud service providers are trying to address these concerns by 
joining industry consortia like the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), Cloud Industry 
Forum (CIF), and the Open Data Center Alliance (ODCA) (Cloud Security Alliance 
2014, Cloud Industry Forum 2014, Open Data Center Alliance 2014). Both CSA 
and ODCA are U.S.-based non-profit organizations. CIF is based in Europe. These 
organizations are trying to develop standards that could be followed by all cloud 
service providers. Another effort in this regard is the Open Stack for cloud and 
Open Nebula. Open Stack is an open source software developer consortium that has 
developed a cloud operating system for massively scalable systems that support pri-
vate and public clouds, two of the most popular cloud deployment models. At pres-
ent only Rackspace and HP have adopted Open Stack and even in those adoptions 
there are variations and so there is not much interoperability option among various 
cloud services. OpenNebula is also an open source software for cloud management 
platforms that are scalable. As the cloud computing industry matures these efforts 
will pay off, enabling the cloud users to move freely between cloud service provid-
ers, just as there is number portability in telecommunications services.
Cloud computing is having a significant impact on ecommerce. Projections are 
that this trend will continue for some time to come (Gartner Research 2013). In 
order for the growth to continue in cloud computing adoption the customers should 
have the facility to switch service providers easily. Even though theoretically cloud 
computing promotes itself as a service that could be used on demand and customer 
pays for what they use, in reality customers will incur cost and time delay in port-
ing their data between service providers. The reasons for this aspect to be looked 
at carefully prior to service initiation are many-fold. First, there is an added cost 
that the service provider charges to transfer data out of their storage. Second, the 
bandwidth available for transfer may not be adequate for a quick data transfer. Busi-
nesses depend on their data very much and the data storage grows rapidly for busi-
nesses. So, to reach a data storage size in terabytes is not uncommon. Third, many 
niche providers enter the cloud service provider market through the use of services 
such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service from major cloud 
service providers. Given the low barrier to entry for being a cloud service provider 

4.2  Major Cloud Service Providers
63
there is a high likelihood of some cloud service providers going out of business is 
high. These factors should make the cloud customer to explore the time and cost 
aspects of switching service provider.
Given the rapid growth of cloud computing industry many small and medium 
sized businesses do not have the ability to assess the quality and reliability of pro-
vider assurances for service. To facilitate these businesses choosing the right type 
of cloud service for their needs and to provide additional value added services to 
customers, many Cloud Service Brokerages (CSBs) have emerged. These Broker-
ages are able to evaluate the many cloud service providers available and to negotiate 
contracts for common services such as email and data storage with service provid-
ers and pass on the savings to the smaller cloud customers. The value added service 
they provide is in the form of service integration among a variety of related services 
such as email and voice mail. The CSB service has grown into a multi-billion dollar 
service industry in itself. Many small and medium sized businesses value the advice 
and guidance of CSBs in selecting the right type of cloud service for their needs. In 
this chapter we will discuss in detail the various cloud service providers and their 
services. Also, we will look at several niche cloud service providers from U.S., Eu-
rope, Australia and Asia who have either a service, regional or language focus. We 
address the important role of third party cloud service facilitators, also known as 
Cloud Service Brokerages. We conclude the chapter with an analysis of the current 
state in the development of global cloud service standards.
4.2  Major Cloud Service Providers
Cloud computing’s attractiveness to businesses involves the service availability 
and reliability. In order to provide both availability and reliability the cloud service 
provider has to make significant investments in infrastructure. Also, the service 
needs to have several redundancies in order to meet customer expectations. The 
unit to measure service availability is the number of 9s in its uptime guarantee. 
For example, major cloud service providers will be expected to have an uptime 
of three 9s meaning that their system should be available 99.9 % of the time. This 
translates to a total downtime of nearly 9 h per year, including time for any routine 
maintenance. We use the three 9s criteria to classify cloud service providers as ma-
jor cloud service providers. These major cloud service providers who are unable 
to meet the three 9s service availability provide service credit to the customers. In 
spite of the best efforts, cloud service providers have experienced several service 
outages during the past 5 years and so it would be unreasonable to expect a higher 
level of service uptime guarantee. If the service provider were to guarantee a four 
9s service availability guarantee then that means that they will have to maintain 
their service all the time, except for 52 min in a year. The economic impact of cloud 
services both in commerce as well as in the cost of cloud services is significant. 
Gartner Research’s projection is that between 2013 and 2016 businesses will spend 
$ 677 billion in cloud services. An IDC study projects that the revenue from public 
cloud services will account for $ 73 billion by 2015 (IDC 2013).

4  Cloud Computing Providers
Based on the criteria set in the previous paragraph for major cloud services, the 
following companies would qualify to be classified as major cloud service provid-
ers based on either size or popularity of their offering with businesses:
• Amazon Web Services
• Google Apps
• Microsoft Windows Azure and Office 365
• HP Cloud
• Rackspace
• CSC Corp
• Verizon Terremark
• Dropbox
• Box
We discuss in detail the varieties of cloud services offered by these companies, the 
type of Service Level Agreement (SLA) these companies offer and their recent sta-
tistics on service availability over the past 2 years. The purpose of this analysis is to 
let the potential customer know the aspects of service that they should be aware of 
in choosing a cloud service provider.
Cloud service has been meeting the needs of organizations of all sizes for devel-
opment and testing using multiple platforms. Given the growth of cloud computing 
over the past decade the businesses now have to come to depend on cloud services 
for routine work as well as in production systems. Managing a cloud service re-
quires the provider to offer some or all of the following types of services: SaaS, 
PaaS and IaaS. These major service providers not only offer these types of services 
as well as support the four deployment models—public cloud, private cloud, hybrid 
cloud and community cloud—discussed in detail in Chapter 3. The focus of the 
major cloud service providers are in the public and private clouds primarily. The 
hybrid and community clouds are often the focus of niche service providers. In the 
following subsections we will discuss in detail the offerings of these major cloud 
service providers.
4.2.1  Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest of the cloud service providers. Its mar-
ket capitalization is such the computing resources utilized by various businesses 
through Amazon are five times larger than all the other cloud services combined. 
These cloud service providers are all featured in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant (Gart-
ner Research 2013). AWS offers a free usage tier similar to the email services from 
Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. Businesses could use the free usage tier and test their 
needs and grow into other premium services offered by AWS such as Elastic Com-
pute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service (S3). AWS provides a single point of 
contact for customers for all their cloud services. This is especially helpful when the 
customer is adjusting to the cloud environment.

4.2  Major Cloud Service Providers
65
Amazon launched AWS in 2006. It has steadily grown this infrastructure over 
the years. Amazon’s overall investment in cloud infrastructure is approximately 
$ 12 billion, which is less than some of the other major cloud service providers. In 
spite of the lower investment AWS is able to offer their cloud services globally. It 
has several thousand customers spread over 190 countries. AWS specializes in hav-
ing various regions strategically located around the world for data storage that the 
customer could choose. The existing regions are distributed as follows:
North America	 3
Europe	
1
Asia	
3
Australia	
1
Latin America	
1
Moreover, AWS has a separate cloud service region for the US government. It is an 
isolated cloud both physically and logically. This cloud service is FIPS compliant 
and as such customers using this cloud for their service to the US government will 
be able to provide FIPS compliance data. To further facilitate customer choice in 
selecting the region for both storage and computing resources to meet their compli-
ance requirements in certain cases AWS has created several Edge Locations within 
each region. For example, in the US East Region based in Northern Virginia there 
are 12 Edge locations in places like New York, Miami, Dallas and Atlanta that the 
customer could select.
AWS offers SaaS, PaaS and IaaS services as well as uses the public cloud and 
private cloud deployment models. AWS services are used by companies of all sizes. 
For example, Dropbox, which pioneered file storage and sharing in the cloud uses 
AWS’s S3 service to store all the customer files, which run into several billion files. 
The demand elasticity that S3 service provides enables Dropbox to use as much 
space as needed to store all customer files, which come at the rate of 1 billion files 
per days. Dropbox uses its own servers as well but they are not used to store cus-
tomer files. Besides Dropbox other notable large companies that use AWS cloud 
service are Netflix, Flickr and Pinterest.
Given the wide popularity of AWS, numerous customers worldwide depend on 
the availability of AWS across all time zones. So, even a small service outage at 
AWS has great impact on people’s need for service globally. This became quite 
evident from several major outages at AWS over the past 5 years. Some of these 
outages were caused by power supply disruption to AWS while others were caused 
by human error. In every one of these instances AWS has credited the customers 
for loss of service because of the pay-as-you-go model it supports. AWS comes up 
with detailed post-outage analysis and makes its findings available for the customer.
AWS offers SLA with three 9s availability and a host of applications in its SaaS 
service. Its public cloud is very heavily used and it offers the US federal govern-
ment exclusive and isolated cloud service. By locating their service regions around 
the world and providing customer the option to select a particular storage region it 
is facilitating customer compliance with respect to knowledge of where the data is 
stored. To facilitate customer’s ability to meet their compliance requirements AWS 

66
4  Cloud Computing Providers
carries multiple compliance certifications such as SAS 70 Type II Audit, FISMA, 
HIPAA and SOX compliance. AWS being the largest cloud service provider many 
software vendors have licensed their product to run on AWS’s EC2 platform. Incor-
porating AWS’ API has become critical for many third party providers who offer 
cloud management services.
4.2.2  Google Apps
Google Apps evolved over the past 5 years. The initial App was Google Docs which 
was launched in 2006. Traditionally people around the world use Microsoft Office 
products such as Word and Excel. Clearly many versions of these Office products 
are in circulation and at times people run into the difficulty of having version in-
compatibility in opening certain Office documents. Google Docs was designed to 
overcome this problem by providing document and spreadsheet creation and shar-
ing capability on the web. The benefit of Google Apps was to provide the customer 
with an application that allows:
• Sharing files in various formats
• Uploading or downloading files in various formats
• Publishing files directly as HTML files
• Keeping the files in read-only format on demand
One of Google’s original cloud service was its Gmail service. The Gmail service 
is used today globally by over 450 million users. Since then Google has expand-
ed its Google Apps to include Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Talk, 
Google Calendar, Google Video, Google Labs and Google Play. All these services 
are very popular with the public because they are free for the public. For example, 
the Google Drive comes with a generous 30 GB free storage capacity and Google 
Talk lets customers communicate over the web for free in spoken format. The latest 
App, Google Play, is an all-encompassing service that incorporates music, movies, 
video, books and news magazines. It is bound to have a significant following in the 
years to come.
Google’s cloud infrastructure grew rapidly over the last 3 years. Today, Google’s 
investment in cloud infrastructure is approximately $ 21 billion, far more than Ama-
zon. Unlike Amazon, Google is into specific services such as Gmail and Google 
Talk. Moreover, much of Google’s services are free and are supported by advertise-
ments. Given this model Google has many competitors for specific services. For 
example, in music the largest competitor for Google Play is Apple’s iTune, which is 
a pioneer in that field. In the case of online file storage, the competition for Google 
Drive comes from Microsoft’s Sky Drive and Dropbox, both of which offer free 
service as well for the public.
Google had its share of cloud outages over the past 5 years. In some instances 
the outage has lasted as long as 30 h. Since millions of customers depend on Google 
Apps all over the world, even a small service disruption for 15 min in its email ser-
vice will have significant impact on customers.

4.2  Major Cloud Service Providers
67
Google offers SLAs with three 9s availability. Google offers all three basic types 
of cloud services—SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. Its popularity as a cloud service provider 
is backed by its major services such as YouTube and Gmail.
4.2.3  Microsoft Windows Azure and Office 365
Microsoft offers cloud service across multiple types—SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. Win-
dows Azure, launched in 2010, specializes in PaaS and IaaS services. Microsoft 
Office 365 specializes in SaaS services from the Microsoft Suite of products. Of-
fice 365, in combination with Microsoft’s SkyDrive, enables business customers 
to easily share word documents, spreadsheets and PowerPoint slides among users 
in dispersed geographic locations. As a true cloud service with a global reach, Mi-
crosoft’s cloud offerings provide the cloud benefits of scalability, demand elasticity 
and pay-as-you-go model for pricing. The SLA provided by Microsoft offers three 
9s availability. Like other cloud service providers, Microsoft also experienced sev-
eral outages over the past 3 years. Given the size of the organization some of the 
causes for outages show that their internal management controls are not adequate. 
For example, their systems did not plan adequately for leap year handling in 2012 
and another failure was caused by simple failure to renew their security certificate. 
Since Azure supports database services using SQL as well as NoSQL, customers 
have the ability to run a variety of database systems over the cloud.
Windows Azure offers the customers a free usage tier which they could try first 
and then subscribe to other premium services offered by Azure. Because of the tight 
integration of the Azure platform with other Microsoft products such as Office 365, 
customers could use a PaaS or SaaS service using one of the Microsoft products. 
Windows Azure provides a single point of contact for their cloud services in order 
to enhance the product usefulness to the customer.
Microsoft entered the cloud market much later relative to other major service 
providers such as Amazon and Google. Yet, Microsoft’s investment in cloud in-
frastructure is approximately $ 18 billion, which is more than AWS’ in this regard. 
Since Microsoft is able to provide a host of commonly expected office productivity 
services such as email, Office Suite of products, it cuts down on adoption issues 
because most users are familiar with the products.
Microsoft provides dedicated Government cloud for various government agen-
cies in US at the federal and state levels. Microsoft’s government cloud service is 
FISMA, HIPAA, SOX, SAS 70, EU Safe Harbor Framework and ISO 27001 certi-
fied. Microsoft offers the federal government agencies dedicated public, private and 
hybrid cloud environments. Its data storage policy lets the agencies know where 
their data is stored. One of the benefits of the government cloud is that the govern-
ment agencies are able to provide citizen services at a reduced cost. For example, 
NASA makes available large volumes of data it gathers from its space explorations 
for citizens to access through the government cloud. The state of Ohio provides 
real time traffic information to the motorists through the Buckeye traffic web site 
(Microsoft 2010).

68
4  Cloud Computing Providers
Microsoft’s service uptime guarantee is at three 9s like all the other service pro-
viders. Learning from the problems faced by Amazon Web Services in managing 
stored data, Microsoft has invested over $ 2 billion in new data centers around the 
world that are capable of running when electrical service is disrupted.
4.2.4  HP Cloud
HP offers cloud computing as a PaaS and IaaS service. The HP Cloud Compute 
is a public cloud. HP is one of two cloud companies that support OpenStack, an 
open source cloud operating system. The main purpose of supporting Open Stack 
standards is to support service portability. The HP’s implementation of Open 
Stack is still evolving and there are incompatible components in the implementa-
tion of cloud service that makes interoperability with other cloud services diffi-
cult. The primary goal of Open Stack standards is to enable interoperability using 
third party providers. HP’s Cloud Compute supports both Windows and Linux 
environments. Two of HPs notable cloud offerings are Converged Infrastructure 
and Cloud Maps. The HP Converged Infrastructure provides greater automation 
in service provisioning and supports multiple operating systems. The HP Cloud 
Maps integrates services from multiple vendors such as Oracle, SAP, VMware 
and SAS.
HP CloudSystems forms the basis for HP’s cloud strategy. This is planned for 
launch in 2014, giving the users greater flexibility. The HP CloudSystems will en-
able the customers to burst into other public clouds offered by AWS, Windows 
Azure and niche service providers in France, Germany and Spain. The partnership 
with providers in European countries is to meet the customer expectations in those 
regions concerning data storage in those regions to meet their compliance require-
ments.
HP’s SLA offers three 9s availability, similar to all the other major cloud service 
providers. As a new entrant into the cloud service market HP is trying to differenti-
ate itself from others both in service requirements and pricing. AWS offers the same 
SLA as HP and in order to meet this SLA, AWS requires users to subscribe to two 
different Availability Zones so that the customer will not experience downtime. 
Moreover, AWS offers a 10 % service credit when their systems are not available. 
HP, on the other hand, requires only one Availability Zone subscription and service 
credits of up to 30 % when an SLA is not met. Some industry observers question 
HP’s claim on SLA.
4.2.5  Rackspace
Rackspace is one of the largest cloud service providers in the world. Besides HP, 
Rackspace is the other company that supports OpenStack. It supports the Open-
Stack operating system for the cloud but it is not fully interoperable with other 

4.2  Major Cloud Service Providers
69
cloud services. The goal of OpenStack is to provide full interoperability with all 
cloud service providers but it will take some more years for this technology to ma-
ture before all cloud service providers adopt the OpenStack operating system for the 
cloud. The Rackspace version of the OpenStack cloud is not compatible with other 
cloud services. The OpenStack service is gradually evolving. Rackspace is giving 
the customer the option of using the new Solid State Drive (SSD) technology which 
provides faster access to stored data. The SSD technology is significantly more ex-
pensive than the traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) technology. For cost compari-
son, it costs $ 0.075/GB in HDD whereas the cost is $ 1.00/GB in SSD. This makes 
the Rackspace cloud service cost higher than that of other cloud service providers 
for those that seek the faster speed for their mission critical services.
Rackspace is known for its customer support, known as Fanatical Support. 
Rackspace provides SaaS, PaaS and IaaS services. Rackspace provides an unusu-
al guarantee of 100 % service uptime, except for routine maintenance. To provide 
such high reliability Rackspace partners with major vendors like Cisco and CA 
Technologies. It has a total of 10 data centers in 6 regions around the world. 
The redundancies built into the architecture include the services of 9 different 
network service providers with high bandwidth. Rackspace’s investment in cloud 
infrastructure is approximately $ 2 billion, far less than other major cloud service 
providers such as AWS and Google. Through the use of network service provid-
ers such as CA Technologies Rackspace Support team is able to get full visibility 
of the customer network and could fix customer access issues quickly by inter-
acting directly with the customer infrastructure rather than through service advi-
sors.
Its database service uses container-based virtualization instead of the traditional 
server-based virtualization. This feature combined with high-capacity network and 
high speed SAN storage service provides customers with scalable high performance 
database systems. Using the open source MySQL software the customers get the 
cost benefit. One of the benefits of cloud service is the ability to eliminate redun-
dancy in storage. This feature in the cloud is called de-duplication, which means 
that only one copy of a file is stored and all additional applications that need this 
stored file content simply have a pointer to the file storage. The de-duplication can 
be at the file level or block level. Typically when an email attachment is sent to sev-
eral users the same file is stored by different users and de-duplication avoids this ex-
tra storage requirement. Rackspace uses both de-duplication and block level com-
pression during data backup. It uses incremental backup beyond the initial backup 
which means that only changes to the files that occurred since the initial backup are 
stored. These features save significant costs for customers for data backup as the 
savings are 10–20 times when compared with the traditional storage technology.
Rackspace had service outages over the past 5 years due to power disruption. Its 
largest data center in Dallas, Texas, was affected multiple times over the past few 
years due to external events that caused the traditional electric utility service to be 
disrupted for a longer period of time and its backup system was not able to keep up 
with the power requirements. In case of service disruption due to outages, Rack-
space offers 5 % service credit for every 30 min of downtime.

4  Cloud Computing Providers
4.2.6  CSC Corp.
CSC Corporation is a large global cloud service provider with data centers in US, 
Europe, Latin America, Australia and Asia. Often customers need support services 
in order to manage their cloud deployments. CSC provides customer support in 
multiple languages such as French, German, Italian, Spanish and Mandarin. CSC’s 
main cloud offerings are vCloud, BizCloud and CloudCompute. The use of vCloud 
from VMware shows CSC’s close partnership with VMware. The BizCloud is an 
enterprise level private cloud meant for large businesses. BizCloud deployment for 
an enterprise through CSC requires 10 weeks to architect. This cloud based service 
is a physically segregated service offering high security and reliability. It saves 
the enterprise from committing funds for capital expenditure and instead uses the 
benefit of the cloud with pay-as-you-go model. Moreover, the enterprise could use 
the managed service option that CSC provides as a cloud service provider. CSC has 
standardized its offerings both in the public cloud and private cloud. Moreover, it 
uses the same pricing model in both of these deployment models. CSC offers SaaS, 
PaaS and IaaS services.
CSC’s CloudCompute service is also an enterprise level service. It is offered as 
an Infrastructure as a Service giving the organization higher levels of control as to 
the types of applications that it wants to run on the cloud. This service could be run 
using any one of the 15 data centers distributed worldwide. Since CSC uses VM-
ware’s vCloud, all applications used in any of these data centers are fully portable. 
The CloudCompute service includes the basic cloud services for computing power, 
storage capacity and high speed networking capability. CSC’s offerings are geared 
towards large enterprises and so small and medium sized enterprises will not benefit 
much from CSC’s expensive services.
CSC offers Storage as a Service, similar to AWS’ S3 service. CSC offers Gov-
ernment Cloud Service for US Federal government agencies in a secure, isolated 
environment. By offering both public cloud and private cloud services, CSC is able 
to meet customer needs for higher levels of security or lower costs (CSC 2014).
4.2.7  Verizon Terremark
Verizon as a company is a telco that has a large presence in the mobile communica-
tion market both for voice and data. Its Terremark division is focused on enterprise 
level cloud Infrastructure as a Service (Verizon 2013). These services are provided 
in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Terremark partners with VM-
ware in offering vCloud Express service which makes its service portable. Verizon 
Terremark’s advantage compared to the other cloud service providers is in having 
the worldwide network connectivity provided by Verizon. Terremark capitalizes on 
this and offers colocation services to enterprises. Colocation enables the enterprises 
to host their mission critical applications on Terremark infrastructure that are locat-
ed in data centers worldwide. The data centers are connected to multiple communi-

4.2  Major Cloud Service Providers

cation service providers. Terremark’s public cloud service connects to AWS, Open-
Stack and Rackspace’s CloudStack. It also supports OpenStack’s Swift standard. 
Terremark’s cloud service supports over 450 different operating systems, including 
the major versions of Windows and various flavors of Linux.
Terremark provides government cloud service as well. This service is isolated 
from the rest of the public cloud offerings from Terremark and supports both NIST 
and FISMA standards. Terremark cloud service complies with multiple standards 
such as SAS 70 Type II Audit, PCI DSS and the European Union Safe Harbor re-
quirements. Terremark also has the new SSAE 16 Type II Audit certification. SSAE 
(Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements) came into force in 2011 and 
effectively replaces SAS 70 Standards and certified by the same organization. Ter-
remark uses the SAN architecture for supporting high volume storage with rapid 
access needs. Its SLA includes three 9s availability (99.9 %) for communication 
services through Verizon infrastructure and dedicated cloud services. For the En-
terprise Cloud Service, Terremark provides SLA only at 99.5 % whereas all the 
major providers such as AWS, Microsoft, Google and Rackspace provide 99.95 % 
availability.
Terremark stands to gain from the availability of Verizon’s communications in-
frastructure to provide reliable VPN tunnels for higher level security for cloud ap-
plications. Through its Infrastructure as a Service and high reliability, Terremark 
provides other businesses the necessary infrastructure to support their Platform as 
a Service. Even though Terremark focuses on large enterprises for its IaaS service, 
through the provisioning of infrastructure for other companies such as Engine Yard, 
Terremark provides access to medium sized businesses access to cloud services.
Security is a major concern for many businesses planning to use cloud service. 
Terremark’s infrastructure physical security is well tested because of Verizon. 
Through the use of an enveloping technology called Cloud Switch, Terremark pro-
vides virtualized instances that are encompassed by the isolation technology. Thus, 
the entire cloud deployment of the customer is within a secure envelope that is 
encrypted end-to-end as the data moves through the Enterprise cloud. Thus the se-
curity feature in Terremark’s service is easy to measure. It also supports integration 
of Big Data Analytics using the open source Apache Hadoop framework through 
its partnership with Cloudera. Since Big Data Analytics is becoming critical for 
many large enterprises, having this feature enhances the value of Terremark’s cloud 
service.
4.2.8  Dropbox
Dropbox is a pioneering cloud storage provider with over 200 million customers 
and 4 million businesses worldwide. The only cloud service that Dropbox offers 
is storage. It manages over 10,000 servers to keep customer file metadata and uses 
AWS S3 service to store the actual customer files. Data indicates that customers up-
load 1 billion files daily. The large customer base is due to the availability of 2 GB 
free storage space, which can be upgraded to 100 GB for an annual cost of $ 99. 

72
4  Cloud Computing Providers
Dropbox provides 256-bit encryption for data in transit or rest. Since the actual files 
are stored with AWS, Dropbox benefits from AWS’ high availability and reliability 
for customer file access.
Dropbox experienced several outages during the past 5 years for brief periods of 
time. It inconvenienced the customers a lot. Dropbox did not identify the causes for 
the outages, making it difficult for customers to place trust in the service. Dropbox 
has serious competition in the storage service from both Google via its Google 
Drive application and Microsoft via its SkyDrive application. Google offers 15 GB 
of free storage and Microsoft offers 7 GB of free storage compared to Dropbox’s 
2 GB free storage. Dropbox has simplified the storage and access process by devel-
oping an API that customers can download and install on their desktops. Beyond 
that the desktop folder serves as the link to Dropbox which makes it easy for the 
users to simply drag and drop their files in the desktop folder for cloud storage. 
Dropbox automatically syncs in the background the customer storage folders with 
their cloud storage. This ease of use has made this service more popular. Moreover, 
this service is available on all three major platforms—Windows, Mac and Linux.
Dropbox gives the customers the ability to access the stored files in any device, 
including mobile devices. For greater security the customer can store files with a 
password so that during file access the password will be required. This is a simple 
file protection that can be easily overcome by a hacker as there are tools available to 
unlock files easily. This is important for small and medium sized businesses to real-
ize without having a false sense of security. Since Dropbox uses AWS’ S3 service 
for file storage, it is not easy for a hacker to access the stored file.
On the SLA front many businesses are concerned with the lack of any service 
level guarantee from Dropbox. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, Dropbox does not 
own its file storage infrastructure as it is handled by AWS S3. The only security fea-
ture that Dropbox claims is that all data in transit are encrypted. This is one major 
reason why several businesses prefer other storage service vendors like AWS. Drop-
box file access controls are much simpler compared to the traditional FTP approach. 
With the link provided by the file owner one can directly access the file without any 
additional authentication.
4.2.9  Box
One competitor to Dropbox that offers comparable service with a business focus is 
Box. This company was launched in 2007. Its service differentiation comes from 
dynamic, flexible, sharable content in any format on any device. Its approach to 
integration with best-of-breed applications such as Google Apps and Salesforce 
makes it more useful for businesses. The content collaboration feature appeals to 
business customers who range from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies. At 
the end of 2013, Box had over 8 million users.
Box guarantees a three 9s (99.9 %) uptime for service availability and provides 
greater security for content both in storage and transit. It uses strong SSL encryption 
for data in transit and data at rest are encrypted according to the AES 256-bit en-

4.3  Niche Cloud Service Providers
73
cryption standard. Box service has the SSAE 16 Type II Audit certification to assure 
businesses of the high level of compliance and controls. Box provides role-based 
access control for file access. Box’s file sharing service is an efficient alternative 
to the traditional FTP method to share files. Businesses needing file sharing feature 
with their customers simply send the link to the file without the need for any ad-
ditional authentication using login and password. Table 4.1 gives a cost comparison 
for file storage among the major services available now.
Even though Box does not have the user base of other cloud storage services 
such as AWS S3 and Windows Azure Storage, it has the ease of use and collabo-
ration features that businesses are looking for in the cloud service. Box supports 
REST (Representational State Transfer) protocol for networked applications as well 
as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) which is more complex than REST. In 
Table 4.2 we provide a snapshot of how Box compares with AWS S3 and Windows 
Azure Storage.
4.3  Niche Cloud Service Providers
In the previous section we considered several major cloud service providers. In the 
marketplace we have several other cloud service providers who are meeting the 
business needs for cloud service using the same benefits of cloud service as the 
main reason. In this section we will discuss in detail several niche cloud service 
providers who focus their attention based on a language, geographic region or spe-
cific industry. In order to put into context the services of niche cloud service provid-
ers we consider Michael Porter’s famous Competitive Advantage generic strategies 
of 1980s. It consists of cost leadership, differentiation, and focus (Porter 1998). 
These three strategies have stood the test of time. Companies succeed when they 
focus on one or more of these three strategies. Some of the cloud service providers

have realized the importance of these three strategies. The niche cloud service pro-
viders mainly focus on service differentiation while others concentrate on a focus 
area such as health care, automotive or finance. Our analysis of the niche providers 
shows that none of them are concentrating on cost leadership as a strategy.
The leader among niche cloud service providers is Salesforce.com. This com-
pany was launched in 1999 to provide Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
service over the web. During the past 15 years this service has grown to be worth 
several billion dollars. Today, Salesforce.com provides the traditional CRM service 
and a business social network service called Chatter. The Chatter service is used by 
many professionals, similar to LinkedIn. The CRM service is offered as a SaaS ser-
vice through Salesforce.com. The service is aimed at all types of businesses—small, 
medium and large. It offers four tiers of service—group, professional, enterprise 
and performance. All services are priced per user per month. The cost for these four 
tiers is $ 25, $ 65, $ 125 and $ 300. As part of the CRM service Salesforce provides 
the customers with leads the business can contact and maintain the contact once it 
is established. It supports the customer’s applications to contact the potential lead 
through any of the preferred methods—email, mobile, social or the web. The target 
marketing is at the 1–1 level which makes the prospect to pay attention to the sales 
pitch. The application is entirely run on the Salesforce site and as such there is no 
client software installation or maintenance. Salesforce does not offer any uptime 
guarantees and no SLA. Instead, it offers End User License Agreement (EULA) 
which specifies how the application would run. As a SaaS and PaaS vendor, Sales-
force focuses on having the applications run efficiently for the customer. It is to be 
noted that Salesforce experienced service outages over the past 5 years which made 
their services unavailable to customers at times. Their goal is to cut down on such 
outages and increase the ability to recover from any application failures quickly.
IBM’s Smart Cloud Enterprise (SCE) is a niche cloud service focused on Infra-
structure as a Service. It is geared towards testing and development environment. 
Since the acquisition of SoftLayer, IBM’s Smart Cloud Enterprise service is being 
phased out in early 2014 because the SoftLayer environment provides highly au-

tomated self-service infrastructure on demand. SoftLayer is focused on bare metal 
servers. Bare metal servers provide a higher level of freedom for the businesses in 
choosing their virtual servers. Typical virtual servers operate within a host operat-
ing system environment and the virtual server resides within that host environment, 
leaving the management of resources within the hardware to the host operating 
system. With bare metal servers the customer has the ability to select their host 
operating system environment for their virtual servers. SoftLayer has over 200,000 
servers in 7 data centers located in U.S., Europe and Asia. Its largest data center is 
located in Dallas, Texas. It’s most recent data center addition was in Asia via coloca-
tion at the Digital Realty Trust, one of the largest data center providers. The main 
reason for this expansion was to reduce the latency time for gaming applications in 
the Asia region.
SoftLayer’s strength is in provisioning bare metal servers in an automated man-
ner. A bare metal server has all the computer hardware in it but lacks a preloaded 
operating system. The customer is able to build up the bare metal server to their 
specification. The main advantage of the bare metal server is that it still supports 
server virtualization but through the hardware rather than through a hypervisor 
layer on the host operating system. The latter and more traditional approach causes 
additional latency, hence the popularity of bare metal servers for applications that 
need higher performance speed. Niche service providers like SoftLayer precon-
figure some of their bare metal servers with the types of virtual servers customers 
would need which make it possible for the customer to rapidly deploy their initial 
configuration of bare metal servers and add additional specialized bare metal serv-
ers shortly thereafter. This significantly reduces the launch time which in the tradi-
tional cloud service model would take several days or weeks to deploy. One other 
large provider of bare metal servers similar to SoftLayer is Internap. These niche 
providers offer innovative services by leveraging technology (Frost 2013).
The five areas of concentration for succeeding as a niche cloud service provider 
are localization of service, geographic location of service, specific industry focus, 
language focus, and ease of use with applications. We will address the specific 
industry focus in health care, automotive and financial sectors where cloud service 
providers have developed a niche. In the health care area one of the niche cloud ser-
vice is Optum Cloud. It enables users to launch new health care applications quickly 
and inexpensively. It also enables users to communicate health data in a secure, 
HIPAA complaint manner. The Optum Cloud facilitates communication between 
health care professionals, hospitals, patients, insurance companies and public health 
officials. With the availability of health related data in one location for a specific 
geographic region or city the Optum Cloud facilitates cohort analysis and bench-
mark development for service standards. It also enables health service providers to 
share patient data in a secure manner. There are several other niche cloud service 
providers who focus on health care industry such as CareCloud and Dell Secure 
Healthcare Cloud.
In the case of the automotive sector two niche service providers are IBM and 
HCL Technologies. The automotive industry is preparing for meeting customer ex-
pectations in automobiles. The automobiles are viewed not only as transporting 
people but also keeping people connected and entertained as they use the automo-

bile. IBM’s Smarter Planet initiative is geared towards this goal (IBM 2012). HCL 
Technologies is based in Asia and through its Agora service it is aiming to meet the 
needs of the automotive companies in building cars that will meet the user expecta-
tions which include high level of connectivity and location based services. Agora 
is a service management platform for cloud service. HCL’s investment in providing 
cloud based service for the automotive sector is worth $ 6.5 billion (HCL 2014).
Another industry vertical that has a significant need for cloud based service is 
the financial industry. Two major companies providing niche cloud service in this 
sector are Sapient and Computer Services Corporation (CSC). Financial service 
industry is extremely data intensive and currency of data is very critical for deci-
sion making. The cloud service should be capable of addressing risk calculation, 
performance attribution and trade reconciliation quickly for financial services. The 
industry needs the ability to introduce new services rapidly. When employees are 
distributed globally it is imperative for the service to have assured security. This can 
be achieved using Virtual Desktop. Cloud service enables making Virtual Desktops 
available globally within a few hours. Services offered by CSC and Sapient support 
the needs of the financial services industry.
Most of the cloud service providers are U.S. based. However, there are several 
niche cloud service providers around the world who focus on a particular geograph-
ic region or provide service in a local language. We describe some such services 
from Europe, Australia and Asia. It is worth noting that 88 % of all cloud service 
providers are U.S.-based and only 6 % of the cloud service providers are Europe-
based. Some of the European cloud service providers are Dimension Data and Colt 
Enterprise Cloud. Both these companies provide cloud IaaS service. Cloud Central 
and BitCloud are two of the cloud service providers from Australia. Cloud Central 
offers enterprise level cloud service as well as a Government Cloud service for 
government agencies. BitCloud offers managed cloud services and enterprise level 
cloud computing services. In Asia, CloudStar Asia provides cloud services for the 
enterprise as well as small and medium sized businesses. Trend Micro is based in 
Japan and offers cloud security services. HCL Technologies is based in India and 
offers cloud service for the automotive sector. Acens Technologies is a cloud service 
provider from Spain offering cloud service in Spanish language.
4.4  Third Party Facilitators
Cloud computing providers are numerous and the consumer seeking a cloud service 
may be at a disadvantage to look into all aspects of the cloud service provider’s 
claims in selecting a suitable cloud service provider. Third party facilitators help the 
customers choose the appropriate cloud service and also help the customer migrate 
to a different service when the service provider is not able to meet the customer ex-
pectations either from the SLA perspective or from the resources availability. Such 
third party services are labeled Cloud Service Brokerages (CSBs). The CSBs help 
the customer deploy and integrate apps on multiple clouds as well as help with cost 
saving options in service selection because the cloud uses the pay-as-you-go model. 

4.4  Third Party Facilitators
77
Some CSBs provide migration, VM portability and API management. According to 
Gartner (Gartner Research 2009) the CSB role could involve:
1.	 Aggregation
2.	 Cloud Service Intermediation
3.	 Cloud Arbitrage
We will briefly expand on these concepts and identify the benefits to the customers 
in using the CSB service.
Aggregation involves combining multiple services to provide an output that is 
value added to the customer. These specialized services focus in aggregation and as 
such provide a much needed service by small and medium sized businesses that do 
not have such capability. The aggregators take two related services and aggregate 
them to add value to the customer. For example, a real estate search could yield 
some properties but combining that search result with a mapping product places 
the search result in a location map. The resulting output adds value to the customer. 
Two cloud service aggregators are Boomi and Cast Iron. Cloud Service Intermedia-
tion means the intermediary is able to provide value added service to the customer 
such as identity and access management. This is the common form of brokerage 
service. Intermediation brokers also help the customer by verifying the pricing and 
billing for cloud services. Alexa Web Information service is one such intermedia-
tion broker. The intermediaries contract for services such as identity management 
with major vendors such as AT&T or Verizon. Cloud Arbitrage is similar to aggre-
gation except that the services aggregated are not fixed always. For example, the 
CSB could select a specific email service for the customer from among the multiple 
email services provided by the cloud service provider (Plummer 2009). Another 
example of arbitrage is when the CSB provides the backup service for a customer 
or performance guarantee. This is an evolving service. The need for such a service 
exists based on the existing brokerage services outside of cloud service. There are 
independent insurers who compare the insurance rates for a customer from among 
several major insurers and find the best rate. This example takes into account how 
different providers assess risk and offer their rates. Such comparative service is 
common in the insurance industry for various types of insurance products. One 
example of a CSB in general is Akamai. It provides validation service by checking 
all incoming web connections to whitehouse.gov web site from being attacked as 
part of a Denial of Service attack. Another example of a CSB is Appirio from San 
Francisco that provides brokerage service to customers.
Cloud Service Brokerage service is a major service industry. According to Gart-
ner Research 20 % of all cloud services used will be through a cloud broker by 2015, 
which is a significant increase from the current 5 % use of cloud services through 
brokers. The brokerage service is sought after by many potential cloud customers as 
they need help in navigating the many details in selecting and benefiting from the 
various services being offered by a cloud service provider. It is projected that the 
annual IT spending on CSB services will reach $ 100 billion in 2014. This type of 
intermediary service is not unique when the type of interaction involves complex 
matter. To leverage the coordination service needed by cloud customers for their 
multiple cloud services the Australian company Cloud Manager has created a new 

78
4  Cloud Computing Providers
cloud brokerage service called CloudMgr that provides an integrated cloud man-
agement solution. It not only integrates the various services used through AWS but 
also the other cloud services the business may use as well as with leading business 
productivity services such as Autotask. Surveys have shown that even though cloud 
computing is growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25 %, the 
overall cloud computing is small relative to the IT outsourcing market. According 
to a 2013 Interxion survey in Europe, the traditional hosting (managed hosting and 
dedicated hosting) account for nearly 82 % and cloud computing accounts for 18 % 
share of the IT services market (Interxion 2013). We conclude this section with two 
typical examples from other industries where such intermediaries play an important 
role: real estate dealings and financial advising.
4.5  Emerging Cloud Standards
Cloud computing, even though it is growing rapidly, is lacking a global standard 
that would let customers evaluate the services better. In this section we will discuss 
three main efforts underway to develop standards. These are: OpenStack, Open-
Nebula and Eucalyptus.
OpenStack is an open source software for building public and private clouds. It 
is a massively scalable cloud operating system (OpenStack 2013). It was developed 
by Rackspace and NASA. The developer and user base for OpenStack spans over 
130 countries. Once many cloud service providers adopt the OpenStack operating 
system then customers will have interoperable service giving greater comparison of 
services. Moreover, customers will be able to change service providers easily when 
their needs change. Among the major cloud service providers, Rackspace and HP 
use this technology. However, their implementations of the OpenStack differ and 
their offerings are not fully interoperable. CERN in Switzerland has adopted Open-
Stack for building a private cloud for the nearly 11,000 physicists around the world. 
This private cloud is expected to grow to 150,000 virtual machines by 2015. Some 
of the major users of OpenStack are AT&T, HP, Rackspace, IBM, RedHat, Ubuntu, 
Suse, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Ericsson, Hitachi, Yahoo, EMC2, Comcast, PayPal, NEC, 
Alcatel-Lucent and Fujitsu.
OpenNebula is an open source enterprise cloud service model. It is meant for 
many of the Linux distributions. It is an industry standard for data center virtual-
ization. It can be customized to fit into any data center (OpenNebula 2013). Since 
VMware dominates the virtualization field its vCloud service competes with Open-
Nebula. This standard has interfaces for the popular AWS Elastic Cloud Computer 
(EC2) and Elastic Block Storage (EBS) instances. Since cloud service uses the pay-
as-you-go model this standard has a fine grained accounting system that integrates 
with all billing systems for the chargeback feature of cloud service. OpenNebula 
standard is platform independent. It supports public, private and hybrid clouds. As 
an open source software it is released under the Apache license. It supports security 
very well through the use of fine grained Access Control Lists to limit access to 
content. Some of the major users of OpenNebula are IBM, Dell, NASA, Unisys, 

4.7  Review Questions
79
China Mobile, Akamai, Blackberry, Harvard University, Academia Sinica, KPMG 
and CentOS.
Eucalyptus is an open source software platform for IaaS service in private or 
hybrid cloud environments. Eucalyptus is an acronym for Elastic Utility Computing 
Architecture for Linking Your Programs to Useful Systems. It was formed from a re-
search project at the University of California—Santa Barbara. Eucalyptus Systems 
was formed as a for-profit organization in 2009 in spite of the open source software 
goal. It supports virtual machines using Windows or Linux operating systems. It in-
tegrates well with AWS’s EC2 and S3. It has a cooperate-compete relationship with 
AWS in which it touts easy move back and forth between AWS’ public cloud and 
Eucalyptus’ private cloud (Nurmi 2009). Eucalyptus effort in contributing a cloud 
standard is minimal except through the open source software it has developed. Its 
status as a for-profit organization does not bode well with its stated goal of being 
an open-source software. It has joined Dell as a technology partner in providing a 
cloud-in-a-box software for developing a private IaaS cloud.
4.6  Summary
In this chapter we have reviewed the cloud services offered by a number of major 
service providers. From this analysis it became clear that each cloud service provider 
has certain strengths in the type of service that they provide. All these cloud services 
enable organizational IT to support business growth and innovation. Moreover, they 
facilitate efficiency in IT service delivery and are agile enough to meet the business 
needs. Besides the major cloud service providers there are also several niche service 
providers who focus their service for specific geographic regions or an industry such 
as health care or a language. Most of the major cloud service providers are located 
in U.S. and some of the niche service providers are located in various countries. The 
niche service providers are also able to meet certain legal requirements of data loca-
tion and protection within their country borders. Moreover, we considered the role of 
Cloud Service Brokers and their important contribution to customers in selecting and 
using a particular cloud service. The Cloud Service Brokers offer a variety of services 
that are value added and so the cloud customers are able to benefit. We noted that 
is a large industry within cloud services. Our discussion included the importance of 
global standards for cloud services and how OpenStack, OpenNebula and Eucalyptus 
are contributing to the maturity of cloud service in a standardized way.

Abstract  Security aspects of cloud computing draw much attention. Many cloud 
customers feel that their lack of control over hardware and software makes their 
information vulnerable for compromise on the cloud. The security issues surround-
ing the cloud vary among the different types of cloud services such as SaaS, PaaS 
and IaaS. Among the cloud deployment models only the public cloud has several 
vulnerabilities. Businesses feel that since they do not control the cloud infrastruc-
ture any data stored in the cloud is insecure. It is more a perception issue than some-
thing that is inherently insecure. The cloud service providers are trying to reassure 
the public of their security practices and provide third party audits to back up their 
claims. Moreover, all the major service providers seek the enhanced SSAE 16 Type 
II Audit and the ISAE 3402 international reporting standards compliance certifica-
tion. In this chapter we will analyze the security implications for businesses from 
the perspective of compliance with laws and industry standards as well as certifi-
cations carried by the service provider. Moreover, the service providers facilitate 
implementing both access control mechanisms and organizational control policies 
to limit the number of privileged users with access to customer data. Also, we dis-
cuss the proactive steps an organization could take to protect their data in transit 
and storage.

5.1  Introduction
Ever since cloud computing was launched nearly 8 years ago businesses have em-
braced this new technology tool with some reservations. The benefits offered by 
cloud computing are too numerous to ignore, especially when it helps small and 
medium sized businesses to obtain computing services at an affordable cost. From 
a business perspective, moving the cost for technology management from capital 
expenditure to operational expenditure is preferred by organizations. Furthermore, 
these types of organizations lack the necessary computing expertise to manage an 
information system. Large organizations have the resources to manage an informa-
tion system on their own but given the rapid advancements in technology and the

constant need to make available the information on mobile devices they find the 
cost factor daunting. Thus, cloud computing offers an effective alternative to all 
types of businesses to have a reliable and affordable computing system since the 
users pay only for the services that they use.
Businesses are accustomed to controlling their computing infrastructure and that 
gave them the sense of security that they needed. With cloud computing they had 
to cede control of the physical infrastructure to cloud service providers located in 
remote locations, with their data and computing resources distributed across a wide 
geographical area. From the user perspective this lack of control over the infrastruc-
ture is unsettling to several businesses. From a practical perspective the small and 
medium sized businesses would not be able to provide the level of physical security 
for computing infrastructure that a large cloud provider could offer. On this aspect 
most businesses agree that a cloud service provider’s assurances are adequate. In 
spite of that the concern for businesses is that they are concerned with the need to 
share the same physical infrastructure with other businesses due to virtualization. 
The cloud service provider is able to offer “unlimited” computing resources on 
demand using the virtualization concept. This way they can have a higher server 
utilization rate and pass on the cost savings to the customers. When companies own 
their servers the server utilization rate is usually less than 20 % according to multiple 
studies (McKinsey 2008; Gartner 2009). Moreover, companies are paying attention 
to energy savings and are supporting green energy initiatives. According to CDW’s 
Energy Efficient IT Report developed from a survey of 760 people representing 
public, private and government sectors shows that cloud computing saves energy in 
two ways. First, the use of virtualized servers and storage accounts for 28 % energy 
savings. Second, there is a significant amount of savings that is not quantified but 
verifiable in that personnel can access cloud computing from remote locations, sav-
ing the commuting and office space cost. In this regard some companies look for 
service providers with energy saving technology in place (CDW 2012).
Cloud security involves the type of cloud service and deployment model cho-
sen. In order to understand these differences let us briefly consider these service 
types and deployment models. The three service types are Software as a Service 
(SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Collec-
tively, these are referred to as the SPI (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) model. SaaS is the most 
heavily used service type and cloud computing is usually associated with this type 
of service. It is popular with small and medium sized businesses. It accounts for 
65 % of the cloud services. In this service the cloud service provider controls all 
aspects of the service provisioning. Customer concern is due to possible data leak-
age because of the multi-tenancy of different businesses using the same physical 
server due to the virtualization capabilities (Sengupta et al. 2011). In PaaS service 
the customer chooses the computing platform they need. This service is typically 
used by developers for testing their application under several platform scenarios 
such as Windows, Mac or Linux. It accounts for 15 % of the cloud services. The 
security concern is similar to SaaS regarding multi-tenancy and data leakage. IaaS 
gives the customer maximum freedom as to the choice of operating system or ap-
plications that they run. Typically IaaS is used by large businesses as an extension 

5.1  Introduction
83
of their internal information system. This service accounts for 20 % of all cloud 
services. In this case the customer has higher levels of control and so they are re-
sponsible for application security aspects. In all these three types of services the 
physical security is still the responsibility of the service provider. Major service 
providers offering these types of services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Mi-
crosoft, Google, Verizon Terremark, Rackspace, Salesforce and Dropbox. AWS’ 
major offerings are Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service 
(S3). Google’s cloud service consists of Google Apps which includes Gmail, 
Google Docs and Google Drive. Microsoft cloud services include the Windows 
Azure platform and the Office 365. Verizon Terremark’s cloud offering is vCloud. 
Rackspace’s cloud service consists of both PaaS and IaaS. Salesforce’s primary 
cloud offerings are its most popular Customer Relations Management (CRM) ap-
plication and the associated Chatter social network service. Chatter is similar to 
LinkedIn in scope. Dropbox’s cloud offering consists of cloud storage.
Cloud storage is one of the important services that cloud service providers offer. 
This type of service evolved in two different strands. In one strand, AWS offered 
storage service as an appendage to their cloud computing service and it usually in-
volves large storage volume. In the other strand, Dropbox pioneered small amounts 
of file storage for individual users for sharing content over the web. This latter ser-
vice caught on with users worldwide and Dropbox now has over 200 million users 
globally, with a daily storage of over 1 billion files. Because of this amount of stor-
age space needed in an elastic manner, Dropbox uses AWS’ S3 service for storage 
of all user files. This has become a fiercely competitive cloud service with Google 
and Microsoft actively competing for storage service. We summarize in Table 5.1 
these cloud storage services, giving additional details on the volume of storage, 
cost, devices supported and the type of content planned.
The three common deployment models are public cloud, private cloud and hy-
brid cloud. The largest of these three deployment models is the public cloud and it 
mostly symbolizes cloud computing in general. Public cloud implies that all cus-
tomers share physical servers with other customers because of virtualization capa-
bility. Most of the public cloud users are small and medium sized businesses, but 
large businesses also use some aspects of the public cloud such as storage. The 
public cloud accounts for 70 % of the cloud service deployment models. It also has 
the most security concerns for the customers. Amazon Web Services is the largest 
public cloud service provider. By definition the private cloud signifies dedicated 
servers and so security is not a concern. At the same time private clouds are relative-
ly more expensive than public clouds. The user should be able to all the resources 
available through a private cloud, which invariably means that it is suited for large 
businesses. Private clouds account for 24 % of all cloud deployment models. Hybrid 
cloud implies a combination of both public and private clouds. Hybrid clouds are 
used by large businesses. Often a large enterprise that needs temporary resources to 
test some applications uses the public cloud taking advantage of the service elastic-
ity and cost savings features of the public cloud. For all their mission critical appli-
cations they have their own internal computing resources or private clouds. Hybrid 
clouds account for 6 % of all cloud deployment models.

5  Cloud Computing Security
Cloud service providers manage their operations using several data centers 
distributed globally. These data centers serve dual purposes. First, it enables the 
service provider to have distributed service provisioning which helps with service 
redundancy. Second, by locating data centers globally the chances of having a data 
center close to a service customer is high. This is important for customers in many 
countries because they may have a compliance requirement that the data may not 
leave the region. Facilitating a global standard for the operation of data centers 
is the Telecommunications Industry Association Data Center Standard TIA-942 
which is used widely. The TIA-942 standard promotes energy efficiency as well 
(TIA 2012). One measure for adoption of a particular cloud service provider is the 
location of a data center closer to the customer. In light of recent revelations of NSA 
surveillance and the force of the USA PATRIOT Act, many European governments 
and businesses are concerned about storing data in US servers. However, such data 
is protected for privacy under the US-European Safe Harbor Agreements. Com-
panies like Salesforce have counted on the Safe Harbor Agreements for European 
customers. However, to overcome any hesitancy on the part of some businesses and 
governments many cloud service providers are opening up new data centers in Eu-
rope. In Table 5.2 we summarize the number of data centers that each cloud service 
provider has globally.
Security is critical for most organizations and consumers. We noted already that 
cloud computing has many benefits to offer the consumers. In certain settings the 
benefits far outweigh the security concerns. We point this out to show that security 
has to be balanced with the overall objective of the user. In a rural healthcare setting 
where cloud computing is used to access the health data of ordinary citizens be-
cause of lack of established infrastructure everywhere, the citizens who are patients 
are more interested in getting the healthcare they need rather than worry about the 
possible security violations in handling their health data. For these patients living 
with less suffering takes higher precedence over the privacy protection needed for 
their health data. In this chapter we will consider several security best practices,

requirements from governments and industry for compliance with regulations and 
standards, and the controls in place.
The Big Four cloud service providers are Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Sales-
force. Their combined market share exceeds 80 % of all cloud services. It is impor-
tant to note that the Big Four are focused more on low-risk services that cater to 
small and medium sized businesses more than large enterprises. For example, when 
a large enterprise wanted to extend their company email to several thousand em-
ployees on their own devices, Microsoft could only commit for 99.9 % availability. 
Because of the success of their offerings to a very large group of global users the 
Big Four are not contributing to growing the security practices. The National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology (NIST) working on guidelines for security best 
practices was unable to get the needed details from Salesforce, which does not dis-

close its security practices (NIST 2011). Of the Big Four, only Amazon has a packet 
filtering firewall that the customer can control on the public cloud. At the same 
time large telcos such as AT&T, Verizon and British Telecom are entering the cloud 
service market geared towards the enterprise level businesses. In order to provide 
the necessary security assurances, a new business called Appirio has emerged that 
offers document management security features for Amazon, Google and Salesforce 
clouds. These trends show that cloud services are expected to attract more providers 
with specialized focus. Like all other security controls in the marketplace for orga-
nizational infrastructure, cloud service also has security controls (Hashizume et al. 
2013). Unlike the infrastructure of a single organization, the cloud attracts attackers 
because they realize that they will have greater impact since the user base is large. 
The complexities in security policies increase as well because of the large number 
of users. Cloud industry has to balance the protection mechanisms used versus the 
security constraints.
5.2  Security Best Practices
Security is a double edged sword. From one perspective people and businesses look 
at the security features as a savior. It helps protect the confidential information of 
the users. From another perspective it is a hindrance to rapid business growth. In 
the case of cloud computing since customers already feel the pressure of lack of 
control they tend to focus more on the security aspects of information storage and 
retrieval. In this section we will focus on several best practices that are available 
for the cloud service providers to adopt and also how some vulnerabilities escape 
service provider attention.
One of the important considerations for a cloud customer is the reliability of the 
cloud service. This is measured in terms of the service uptime of the provider. This 
means that the service provider is able to guarantee its service availability a through 
Service Level Agreement (SLA) at a certain rate. The unit of measure for this is the 
number of 9s in the service level. Major cloud service providers such as Amazon 
Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft, Rackspace and Salesforce all provide 
service guarantee at three 9s level, i.e., 99.9 % availability. For normal computing 
resource availability this is a high level of uptime. However, when the service offer-
ings are concentrated with a few providers then a large number of people depend on 
those services and so the customer expectation is 100 % availability. For example, 
Google’s Gmail service is used by over 450 million users globally. Gmail is a cloud 
application available for free for individual users. When the Gmail service is inter-
rupted even for a few minutes it has major ramifications globally. So, one of the best 
practices is to make the cloud service reliable. Even a three 9s uptime guarantee 
allows only a total downtime of 9 h per year. An uptime guarantee of four 9s allows 
for only a 53 min total downtime per year (Srinivasan 2014a). A recommended best 
practice would be to make the cloud offering reliable with at least a three 9s up-
time. Customers should be vary of any uptime guarantee at any higher level as they 
would be very difficult to keep. In reality all major cloud service providers have 

5.2  Security Best Practices
87
experienced significant outages over the past 5 years that would violate the uptime 
guarantee. In these situations the service providers have offered cost credits for us-
ers. It is important for the service providers to explain to the customers the reason 
for the outage and how they would prevent a recurrence. This is expected of service 
providers to maintain customer trust.
Cloud service providers would not know the sensitivity nature of the data stored 
by customers. For this reason the service providers feel that they are not responsible 
for protection of customer data (Ponemon Institute 2011). Customers on the other 
hand expect the service provider to protect their data since they are responsible for 
managing the computing infrastructure. In order to satisfy customer expectations 
the cloud service provider should make their service management aspects transpar-
ent. This includes making available the list of management personnel with elevated 
privileges to access the server data. Moreover, there should be a log of all data 
access by management personnel that the customer can access on demand. This 
will provide the customer the necessary confidence about the data management 
practices (Rittinghouse and Ransome 2009).
Confidence engendered by service provider security practices is often a mat-
ter of perception by the customer. To enhance such perception the service provid-
er should make available their security policies and relevant data to third party 
registries. One such registry is maintained by Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), an 
industry consortium that develops security standards and best practices (Cloud 
Security Alliance 2013). CSA’s members include all the major cloud service pro-
viders—Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, Rackspace, Salesforce, IBM 
and Cisco. CSA registry is called STAR. It stands for Security, Trust and Assur-
ance Registry (CSA STAR 2011). STAR collects a variety of security practices 
data such as physical security controls, number of privileged users at the manage-
ment, service provider audit data and compliance certifications. CSA makes avail-
able a security questionnaire titled Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire 
(CAIQ). Responses found in this questionnaire enable the potential customer to 
assess the cloud service provider attributes such as compliance with standards like 
HIPAA, security and governance policies. The third tool available is the Cloud 
Control Matrix (CCM) from CSA. The Cloud Control Matrix has an extensive set 
of questions for which the service provider’s data helps the customer assess the 
security. For example, the CCM contains data about the business’ compliance with 
industry-accepted security standards, control frameworks, audits and regulations. 
Moreover, the service provider reports in CCM all data concerning risk manage-
ment, business continuity, data leakage prevention, automated equipment identi-
fication for connection authentication and data access security for mobile devices. 
The fourth tool available for the service provider is the Cloud Commons’ Service 
Measurement Index (SMI). The SMI provides a set of business-relevant Key Per-
formance Indicators (KPIs) (Cloud Commons 2011). All these help enhance the 
reputation of the service provider through the use of commonly accepted security 
practices  The National Institute of Standards and Technology maintains a vulner-
ability database that could also be consulted by customers to assess the security 
aspects of the service provider (NIST 2013).

88
5  Cloud Computing Security
Use of sound security practices enables the cloud service provider to gain cus-
tomer trust, especially when services are provided using remote infrastructure. 
Cloud service providers understand that customer trust is earned and cannot be 
taken for granted. One way to earn customer trust initially is to have an association 
with other trusted entities. For example, major multinational corporations such as 
Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Salesforce have earned cus-
tomer trust over many years of reliable service. Even these providers partner with 
other best-of-breed companies such as Cisco and RSA for specific services like 
firewall control and encryption. Customers place trust in organizations that have a 
good reputation. Thus, reputation of the organization is one aspect of trust.
Cloud services should use new methods to authenticate users. In this context we 
will address two potential vulnerabilities in authentication using existing userid-
password combinations. This technology was developed over 50 years ago when 
computing resources were not advanced as they are today. Service providers may 
not use encryption technology to store passwords in the first place and where en-
cryption is use it may not be strong. Systems that do not use encryption run the 
highest risk. To identify service providers who do not use encryption to store pass-
words, simply use the ‘Forgot Password’ feature to recover the password. If the 
password comes back in clear then that provider’s system has a vulnerability. Ser-
vice providers who do not require strong passwords containing special characters 
are likely using databases to store the passwords where the special characters have 
special meanings. Without the use of strong encryption, user authentication in cloud 
services is not adequate. Today’s personal computers have many times the process-
ing power of large computers of 30 years ago. Consequently, cracking an encryption 
using brute force is possible with simple encryptions. Because of such vulnerabili-
ties breaches occurred at LinkedIn and eHarmony, two widely used cloud services. 
To overcome the encryption problem a simple method exists which adds an ad-
ditional value to the string, called salt, that varies from password to password. The 
use of salt with passwords negates the ability of the use of rainbow tables for fast 
lookup to find password matches. Another method to enhance user authentication 
in the cloud is to use a two-factor authentication. The two-factor authentication is a 
requirement in US for financial transactions over the web. In this approach the user 
id-password combination is supplemented with unique security questions associat-
ed with the user. Financial institutions use an added level of security with two-factor 
authentication with a security image chosen by the user for their login. These types 
of authentications are application-based and so the customer should verify that the 
cloud service is capable of running such applications for authentication.
Cloud service security should extend beyond cloud processing to cloud stor-
age as well. The basic requirement of any cloud storage is the protection of data 
confidentiality, integrity and availability. It is typical for businesses to store data on 
the cloud when it is not heavily used. Healthcare industry generates large volumes 
of data and they get stored on the cloud using the HIPAA mandate of data anony-
mization. Theoretically such data should protect individual identity. However, using 
publicly available data about individuals a test was run against the Massachusetts 
Group Insurance Commission data stored in the cloud. A search of this database 

5.2  Security Best Practices
89
using some common data such as zip code, gender and date of birth revealed the 
medical history of the State Governor (Chow et al. 2009). This is an application 
vulnerability and it clearly shows that not all cloud service providers may have the 
tools to check the application vulnerabilities when they offer such services as part 
of Software as a Service.
Cloud service benefits from virtualization, which means that on a physical hard-
ware one could emulate multiple hardware running different operating systems. 
VMware is the leader in offering virtualization software. When a physical server 
consists of multiple virtual machines (VMs), each VM runs in a Virtual Machine 
Environment (VME). VMEs are popular with researchers dealing with malicious 
software detection. Carpenter, Liston and Skoudis show in detail how malicious 
hackers detect the presence of VMEs and avoid hardware running VMware because 
they could not attack such machines easily (Carpenter et al. 2007). They point out 
further how they could hide the VMEs from attackers. This shows the importance of 
virtualization and at the same time how malicious hackers could detect VMEs and 
try to take advantage of known vulnerabilities in operating systems and escape to 
the host operating system from the guest operating system and cause serious dam-
age. Along the same lines Zhang, Juels, Reiter and Ristenpart show that when VMs 
are used a malicious hacker could launch a side channel attack that lands the attack-
er in someone else’s computing space from which the attacker could cause serious 
damage (Zhang et al. 2012). Even though VMs are inevitable in cloud environments 
these two security problems should make the customer aware of protection mecha-
nisms needed against such attacks. A recent trend in cloud services is the use of 
“bare metal” servers instead of Virtual Machines. Bare metal servers function simi-
lar to Virtual Machines except that the customer who launches the bare metal server 
decides on the operating system to run on these machines (Softlayer 2013). One 
large company providing bare metal servers is Softlayer, an IBM-owned company.
Security services are difficult even in organization owned infrastructure. In 
cloud environment it is all the more difficult because the customer does not own 
the infrastructure. In this case the customer would benefit from the services of a 
third party cloud broker who would look for secure applications that could be run 
in the customer cloud area as well as monitor the security practices of the cloud ser-
vice provider. Third party Cloud Services Brokerage (CSB) is a large business with 
many major companies providing this service. Some of these large companies are 
IBM, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Google, Salesforce and Rackspace. According to Mar-
ketsandMarkets forecast the CSB market is expected to grow from $ 1.57 billion in 
2013 to $ 10.8 billion in 2018.
One aspect of dealing with cloud security involves risk management. As we men-
tioned earlier, cloud system reliability is one of the risk characteristics. All major 
cloud service providers have experienced service outages that have resulted in these 
companies providing service credit to the customers because of SLA requirements. 
Based on the reality of the situation rather than the SLA the cloud customer can 
better manage risk by using the services of more than one cloud service provider. 
For example, the customer could use one cloud service provider for all primary 
functions but use another service provider for cloud backup. This way, when the 

90
5  Cloud Computing Security
main service provider’s system is not up then the customer could access their data 
from the other service provider where the backup data is stored. In order to do a 
total backup on a consistent basis one could adopt disk mirroring. Even though this 
is slightly expensive for the customer, at least it provides a risk mitigation when one 
service fails.
Risk management has four basic aspects. These are: Avoidance, Mitigation, 
Sharing, and Acceptance. Depending on the type of cloud service used the avoid-
ance category has some strategies. With SaaS service used on a public cloud, which 
is the most used combination of cloud service, the customer has to use encryption 
technology to protect the data in transit and rest. This way, even if the data is lost 
by the service provider it would not cause harm to the customer. Risk mitigation in-
volves knowing the risk and taking alternative steps. For example, when health data 
needs to be shared with a third party, it could be made available with a password 
and the password itself is transmitted using a different communication channel. 
Given the public nature of cloud services, sharing risk is one of the best options for 
many customers. This can be achieved via an explicit section in the Service Level 
Agreement. Another method is to use a third party cloud broker who could handle 
the same. For example, the customer is able to share their risk in storing data with 
the service provider. The service provider assures the customer that their data will 
not be released to a third party or government agencies without customer consent 
or notification, depending on the nature of the need for data disclosure. The final 
risk management strategy involves accepting that certain risks are inherent in do-
ing business. For example, when a small or medium sized business contracts with a 
third party payroll service provider such as ADP, they accept the inherent risk that 
ADP could lose control of the customer data (Srinivasan 2014b).
Having identified some risk management strategies above we can recommend 
some solutions. First, much of the customer risk is centered around the use of pub-
lic cloud, especially for placing any sensitive data on the cloud. The recommenda-
tion here would be to use a private cloud or institute a Virtual Private Network 
access to the data, which is kept in encrypted form (COSO 2012). The drawback 
to this solution is that if the data were to be accessed by mobile devices then they 
may not have the necessary computing power to decrypt the content retrieved. 
So, some restrictions to that effect may have to be instituted. Second, when us-
ing a cloud service provider data is in a central location and so some governments 
may try to access it without the knowledge of the data owner. The service provider 
should have policies against such access and make available data access logs to 
the customer on demand. Third, the cloud service provider should make available 
data in a central repository like the Cloud Alliance Security, Threat and Assurance 
Registry (CSA STAR 2011) that makes it easy to assess the risk of cloud comput-
ing. Fourth, the service providers should be required to notify customers in the 
event of a security breach. Fifth, service providers should report on incident han-
dling and monitoring activity to build customer trust. Sixth, the service provider 
should provide assurances that data deletion is propagated through all backup cop-
ies. The European Union Report titled “Cloud Computing: Benefits, risks and rec-
ommendations for information security” has many such features identified (Euro-
pean Union Report 2009).

5.3  Compliance and Certifications
91
In concluding this section we note that cloud security has remained a major con-
cern for many global businesses for many years according to several global surveys. 
Alcatel-Lucent’s 2011 study of 3886 IT decision makers around the globe showed 
their second most concern with cloud services was data security. Gartner Research 
survey in 2009 and 2012 shows that cloud security is the top concern for enterprises 
planning to move their data into cloud (Blum 2009). The American Institute of 
CPAs’ study in 2013 shows that security is the top concern for CPA firms moving 
to the cloud. Global Survey of internet infrastructure decision makers in 2013 by 
Internap Network Services clearly shows that security is the top concern of many 
companies that are not currently using cloud computing services. Associated with 
the security concerns is the frequent occurrence of data breaches at the central re-
positories such as the cloud service provider storage. These are a sampling of many 
surveys which show that security remains a top concern for existing cloud custom-
ers as well as potential customers.
5.3  Compliance and Certifications
In several industries such as health care and finance the businesses have to certify 
that they meet strict security guidelines that are mandated by laws. In this section 
we will review all the important compliance requirements and the possible certi-
fications that a cloud service provider will be able to acquire. These compliance 
requirements and certifications assure the potential customer of the sound secu-
rity practices of the cloud service provider. Any healthcare related business moving 
their computing operations to the cloud will have to certify that their computing 
service meets the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) re-
quirements. Patient health data protection is paramount under HIPAA. Cloud ser-
vice provider will be able to get HIPAA certification upon meeting the strict security 
requirements concerning the infrastructure and management policies of the service 
provider.
Businesses associated with finance industry have to meet Sarbanes–Oxley Act 
(SOX) and Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) requirements concerning sound in-
ternal controls and privacy policies. Two of the important internal control require-
ments of SOX are separation of responsibility and the principle of least privileges. 
The cloud service provider having internal control policies that restrict the same 
user from authorizing an action and performing the action would meet the SOX 
requirement for separation of responsibility. Likewise, if management personnel are 
granted only those privileges that are required to perform their duties then it would 
meet the principle of least privileges. The GLBA requires the business to protect 
the privacy of the individual or business that they are dealing with and also make 
known their privacy policies. Meeting SOX and GLBA requirements enables the 
cloud service provider to be certified that they are compliant with these laws. This 
helps the potential cloud customer to meet their compliance requirements for SOX 
and GLBA while using the cloud service.

5  Cloud Computing Security
Cloud services are extensively used by governments at the federal, state and lo-
cal levels. Since the US federal government use of cloud services is so extensive, 
all major cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft, Google, Rackspace 
and Salesforce have a separate government cloud that is isolated from their public 
cloud offerings. All government business requires meeting the Federal Information 
Security Management Act (FISMA) standards. In order for government agencies 
as well as others providing service to the government sector to meet the FISMA 
requirements the government cloud service provider should get FISMA certifi-
cation. FISMA requires organizations to continuously monitor their assets, con-
figurations and vulnerabilities almost round the clock. It also requires strict iden-
tity management for all personnel having access to the systems. Since the cloud 
service provider controls the infrastructure such requirements could be met only 
if the cloud service provider is FISMA certified. Consequently, it is essential for 
the government cloud service provider to have FISMA certification. Major cloud 
service providers are committed to having their service comply with the required 
government laws and industry standards so that their customers will be able to 
meet their reporting requirements for compliance. We summarize in Table 5.3 all 
the important certifications that major cloud service providers are complying with 
now.
Cloud computing growth has been exponential over the past 5 years. The major 
service providers all use proprietary technologies and this new technology tool does 
not have a common global standard. This makes it difficult for cloud customers 
to switch from one service provider to another for whatever reason. We saw in 
the last section some effort to provide comparable data in a single source such as 
the STAR registry, the Cloud Control Matrix or the Service Measurement Index. 
Still, some form of third party audit of the cloud service provides the necessary 
confidence building information for the cloud customers. In this regard most cloud 
service providers seek the SAS 70 Type II Audit. This audit verifies the cloud ser-
vice provider claims about internal controls, service uptime and security policies. 
This type of service has been around for a long time. In order to meet the interna-
tional reporting requirements this service has been revised and renamed as SSAE 
16 (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements). It was launched in 2011 
and cloud service providers who previously met the SAS 70 Type II Audit require-
ments are now embracing the SSAE 16 standard. This standard is only applicable

for the audit component of third party validation of service quality (SSAE16 2011). 
Associated with SSAE 16 is the international standard ISAE 3402, which gives the 
details on the global assurance standards for reporting on the controls at the service 
organization level (ISAE3402 2011). Most organizations that have the SAS 70 Type 
II Audit compliance are now updating their certification to the revised SSAE 16 and 
ISAE 3402 standards. Besides these standards, many service providers are comply-
ing with the ISO 27001, ISO 9001 and European Safe Harbor Agreements for data 
protection and privacy standards. These international standards enhance the secu-
rity compliance aspects by focusing on associates set of standards. In Table 5.4 we 
summarize the status of global compliance certifications acquired by major service 
providers.
In addition to several government laws requiring security compliance, there are 
also other industry standards that have to be met in certain cases. The case in point 
is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). This deals mostly 
with Point of Sale (POS) terminals having the adequate security safeguards. For 
those businesses such as car rental agencies and restaurants that use portable card 
swipe devices, additional mobile unit-to-base device communication encryption ca-
pability is required. If the cloud service provider meets the PCI-DSS requirements 
as part of their business processes then their customers will be able to meet their 
compliance requirements. For this reason the cloud service provider would need to 
acquire the PCI-DSS certification. Since payment cards are used globally and since 
the cloud computing service is used globally, it is essential for the cloud service 
provider to meet the PCI-DSS standards.
With the advancements in communication technology, many mobile devices are 
able to handle credit card data without a card swipe device. Customer is able to reg-
ister their mobile devices ahead of time and run the special App that facilitates their 
use of credit card with mobile devices. The security associated with these Apps is 
now transferred to the mobile communications provider. The apps themselves must 
still comply with PCI-DSS. The POS merchants who have to bear the POS security 
cost and the associated audit, like the mobile apps payment mechanism because it 
saves them the cost associated with credit card processing. Since the payments are 
now handled through mobile devices without a card swipe, the future of mobile 
commerce (mcommerce) depends on the cloud’s ability to handle secure transac-
tions. There should be mechanisms to authenticate the user prior to the use of a

The volume of mobile commerce is expected to grow from $ 42 billion in 2013 to 
$ 113 billion in 2017  (eMarketer 2013). This is a compelling reason for enhancing 
cloud security to support mcommerce applications.
5.4  Access Control
Cloud customers are fully cognizant of the fact that they do not have control over 
the cloud infrastructure. Consequently, they expect the cloud service provider to 
have suitable authentication tools to control access to the stored data. Moreover, 
the privileged users at the service provider management level should not be able to 
view or modify the customer data. Automatic logs of data access should be avail-
able to the customer in order to ease their concern that a rogue privileged user might 
have access to their data. The service provider should be transparent with the access 
control policies. By design the service provider manages the cloud infrastructure 
but does not own the customer data which resides in their servers.
The access control issue for cloud customers is applicable for the SPI model 
(SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and the two major cloud deployment models—public cloud and 
private cloud. This means this problem is applicable to small, medium and large 
businesses that use cloud service. Multiple surveys have shown that over 75 % of 
the businesses worldwide use cloud services. Businesses that have a mature ac-
cess control process in their internal systems have to rethink the way cloud access 
control is handled. Typically when a hybrid cloud approach is used by enterprises 
they use a private cloud for sensitive material and the public cloud for less sensitive 
applications. On the private cloud side the enterprise controls access and so it can 
use the existing internal control models. On the public cloud side the access control 
issues relate to how the applications are deployed. Because multi-tenancy and vir-
tualization are quite prevalent in the public cloud the cloud customer is dependent 
on the cloud service provider controls for controlling access to their processes and 
data (Shackleford et al. 2013).
One common problem with access control is the type of authentication used to 
allow a user to have access to a device or service. Typical authentication mecha-
nism used is user id and password combination. This is an older model that has 
been in use for over 50 years. With cloud technology there is greater granularity of 
access control needed. Typically when passwords are needed for several applica-
tions users tend to use the same password for all applications or write them down 
for later remembrance. Both approaches could introduce significant risks. One way 
to overcome this problem is by using Single Sign On (SSO). The SSO concept has 
given rise to an open standard called OpenID which enables the cloud user to have 
a single identity for multiple services. Before making all the cloud applications such 
as email, CRM, Calendar and Dropbox available to the user, using the corporate au-
thentication procedure a one time password (OTP) is generated. McAfee provides 
such an application that could be run in the user’s desktop that is integrated with the 

5.4  Access Control
95
internal authentication process usually associated with Windows Active Directory. 
The OTP is the access control mechanism for all cloud applications. Once the user 
provides the OTP the cloud interface makes available all the applications that the 
user can access. Another way to control access to applications is using two-factor 
authentication. The validation data for two-factor authentication must be stored in 
internal systems.
Another situation where access control is needed involves users unknowingly 
releasing sensitive authentication data by using untrusted channels. This could lead 
to data loss through security breaches. Service providers should support data loss 
prevention (DLP) tools when customers attempt to store certain type of sensitive 
data in the cloud. For example, when an authorized user attempts to store a file with 
credit card numbers of customers from the internal secure system to an external 
file storage system such as Dropbox, the DLP tool would be able to prevent the 
file transfer. Typically encryption is used to store sensitive data in the cloud. This 
is not a good practice in light of the fact that using side-channel attacks hackers 
could retrieve the decryption key stored in the cloud (Ristenpart et al. 2009). In 
this case, using access control, sensitive information could be kept off of the cloud 
with suitable security policies. The enforcement of the security policies will pre-
vent the storage of sensitive data in the cloud in the first place. Another important 
reason for having a cloud application providing access control to social media is to 
prevent the transfer of malicious malware onto the internal company network from 
the cloud. Businesses can mitigate such threat using threat intelligence and access 
control. Businesses should not use cloud service provider reputation as one metric 
in bypassing access control.
Closely associated with access control is Identity Management for access. OAuth 
is an open standard developed in 2007 for providing access control using open 
standards (OAuth 2007). Major cloud service providers such as Google and AWS 
have proprietary APIs that have similar functionality. Use of OAuth by the service 
provider will support customer mobility between cloud services. Identity and Ac-
cess Management (IAM) allows the organization to control access to resources and 
the level of access to resources. For example, in large enterprises the organizational 
IT manages access control using a central repository such as the Active Directory. 
However, entities within the organization over a period of time start using SaaS ser-
vices for tactical reasons. Such use bypasses the central access control repository. 
When privileged users from this group of SaaS users leave the organization, the 
central repository will not be aware of the elevated privileges the user had for spe-
cialized services. Using IAM on the other hand, organizations will be able to con-
trol access as needed. Federated Identity Management involves the use of existing 
identity verification systems and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 
helps with the management of the access control. SAML is an open standard used 
by many identity providers like McAfee.
Identity management in cloud computing is essential in order to provide secure 
and robust service using the cloud. He, Tran and Xie (2014) describe an architecture 
for identity management in Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). A brief summary of 
this document is presented here to show the importance of IAM in MCC. The archi-

96
5  Cloud Computing Security
tecture consists of mobile network services (MNS) and mobile users (MUs). MUs 
connect to the cloud either through service provider APIs or embedded browser 
applications. The wireless link for MUs is either Wi-Fi or cellular. When a request 
emanates from an MU, the request and MU’s location information are sent to MNS 
where Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) are performed. Since 
this takes place at the server end it has the necessary computing power and does 
not drain the battery life of the MU. Once the request is validated it is relayed to 
the service provider. During this process of AAA the system uses one of Location 
Based Access Control (LBAC), Role Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute 
Based Access Control (ABAC) relative to the user’s request. This MCC architecture 
has the advantage of having access to large storage volumes of cloud storage once 
the access control is validated. Since the MU access is via the cloud, there is greater 
reliability in data access and the service provider has the ability to run anti-malware 
scanning on the data. The potential limitations of MCC are that the security and 
privacy concerns associated with the cloud service provider are inherited. Since 
the MU is resource-limited, a lightweight security framework has to be developed 
for running on the MU. Thus, IAM is feasible with mobile devices which dominate 
the access request origination points. Since businesses of all types allow end-user 
devices such as cell phones, mini Notebooks and Tablet PCs, a robust IAM process 
for mobile devices is essential in connection with the cloud (Takabi et al. 2010).
5.5  Organizational Control
In this section we will consider how organizations transition to cloud service and 
how their control systems change accordingly. As noted earlier cloud services are 
extremely popular with most of the small and medium sized businesses. Typically 
these are businesses with less than 250 employees. Most of the touted benefits of 
cloud computing are realistic for these businesses. However, large businesses such 
as major enterprises have the resources to manage their own computer system. Sev-
eral of these large businesses are using cloud services for some applications but 
are still hesitant to trust cloud services because of loss of control and several well 
publicized outages and data breaches. For businesses of all types control of their op-
erating environment is essential. We will analyze how businesses could retain some 
of the organizational control as they move their services to the cloud.
Cloud service uses the SPI model—SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. The controls vary 
depending on the type of cloud service used. SaaS customers fully depend on the 
cloud service provider for all their computing needs. In order to realize the cost 
benefits an organization must choose the type of third party SaaS application. For 
example, small and medium sized businesses choose email, office productivity and 
database applications on the cloud. Microsoft and Google provide these types of 
services over the cloud. Small and medium sized businesses do not maintain an 
internal and external system. They transition their entire control mechanism to the 
cloud. For medium sized businesses the control system could be federated. For large 

5.5  Organizational Control
97
businesses the organizational control could involve a two-factor authentication. The 
cloud API for an application should be able to recognize the access credentials of a 
user. In order to protect the authentication data from getting transmitted through the 
cloud specialized APIs have been developed that support Single Sign On whereby a 
one-time password is generated based on the user credentials and the one-time pass-
word is what gets transmitted for organizational control to applications and data.
The question arises as to how the cloud services could enhance the trust of large 
businesses to move their internal computing operations to the cloud. The cloud ser-
vice approach towards this end could be classified as follows:
1.	 Will the organization gain the most by moving services to the cloud?
2.	 Will the organization lose the least by moving services to the cloud?
In answer to item 1 the cloud service could point out the significant cost savings to 
the organization by moving capex to opex. Furthermore, the organization will be 
able to retain greater control over their services by using the Infrastructure as a Ser-
vice feature of the cloud. When large organizations use the cloud for storage, they 
could use a hosted private cloud coupled with encryption of data at rest. Moreover, 
organizational control over security aspects is enhanced by using a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) to access the cloud storage. The encryption and VPN aspects in-
crease the cost of cloud service but in order to maintain the organizational control 
they are necessary. In answer to item 2 the cloud service could target small and 
medium sized businesses because they do not have the necessary internal resources 
to do what can be done cost effectively over the cloud. Since large businesses can-
not entertain loss of control by moving to the cloud for cost savings, cloud services 
will have to target only the small and medium sized businesses. Since the number 
of small and medium sized businesses is large it would be economical for cloud 
services to work with them. We summarize the control aspects discussed so far in 
Table 5.5
The importance of organizational control arises when certain applications are 
moved from the organization to the cloud. In such instances if there is any database 
associated with the application, then it will be efficient to move the database also 
to the cloud and take steps to protect the database. One typical application that is 
often moved to the cloud is email. The authentication information for email server is 
located in IT directories that are synchronized with HR databases. When the email 
application is moved to the cloud, for faster response times the authentication infor-
mation should also be moved to the cloud. For security purposes this database could

be kept in read only format, thus providing faster lookup times. The cloud service 
provider should take precautions to protect this authentication database and prevent 
transfer of this file to any other application. Access control and data leak prevention 
will become top priorities for businesses when they move the services to the cloud. 
One solution available today is through the use of SAML and OAuth along with role 
based access control.
Finally, in the absence of global standards for cloud computing, a customer us-
ing a cloud service for certain applications should be able to revert the service from 
cloud to the organization. This happens when a cloud service provider goes out of 
business. Reverting to the business the application may not be a choice for many 
enterprises as they may not have the expertise in-house to run the application. In 
such cases a new set of organizational controls may have to be introduced when the 
reverted service is moved to a different cloud service provider because of propri-
etary APIs in the cloud.
5.6  Summary
Provisioning cloud computing security is the responsibility of the service provider. 
The service provider will be able to offer the necessary security to the applications 
and data in the cloud. The security aspects vary from service to service. SaaS ap-
plications are the most used service among the many public cloud offerings. Also, 
from a security perspective the customer lacks most control when using a SaaS 
application. On the other hand, customers have greater control when using the IaaS 
service. The customer should move only the low-risk applications to the cloud. Use 
of APIs facilitates accessing applications moved to the cloud. Using Single Sign 
On helps control access to the applications with suitable authentication. Using Data 
Loss Prevention techniques the service provider may have policies to evaluate all 
customer requests. Access control is essential to protect the applications as well 
as the stored data. Several new techniques such as OpenID and OAuth have been 
developed. Organizational control is essential when enterprise consider moving cer-
tain applications to the cloud gradually.

Abstract  Cloud computing is widely accepted by businesses of all sizes. However, 
the level at which the adoption of cloud computing has moved varies significantly 
based on company size. Small businesses that lack the people or financial resources 
to manage a computing system mostly have embraced cloud computing without 
too much reservation. Medium sized businesses also benefit from transferring the 
management aspects of a computing system to the cloud. Large businesses have an 
option to use their internal systems exclusively or to transition some services to the 
cloud and keep the more sensitive applications in-house. This hybrid approach is 
expected to last for a while. Businesses consider cost savings as an attractive fea-
ture but require more control over their infrastructure. For this reason the private 
cloud deployments are growing rapidly. Cost comparison for cloud service ver-
sus in-house computing environment shows that private clouds are still cost effec-
tive. In this chapter we assess the reasons for companies moving to the cloud. This 
assessment includes cost, availability of service, reliability and security. We study 
in detail the cost factors of cloud computing and how it could help with cost sav-
ings for businesses. We analyze the risk components of cloud service and discuss 
how businesses could mitigate the cloud risk by using third party controls. One of 
the important things to note is that businesses tend to use a form of cloud service 
indirectly. We analyze in depth how outsourcing compares with cloud computing.

6.1  Introduction
Cloud computing’s benefits are not disputed. Businesses realize that they have at 
their disposal all the computing services that they need and they will pay only for 
what they use. This is ideal for cost containment for a business. For many business-
es the focus is on their core strengths. At the same time the businesses realize the 
importance of having a good computing system with the latest hardware and soft-
ware technologies. If the business were to develop this capability on their own they 
would not only have to spend a large sum of money but also take their focus away 
somewhat from their core strengths. For many small and medium sized businesses 
allocating substantial financial resources to computing would be difficult. For this 

102
6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
reason, when cloud computing came along as an option, they opted for the cloud 
service overwhelmingly. For small businesses the tradeoff is that they get access to 
high end computing technology at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, since the tech-
nology will change rapidly, they do not have to keep up with updating and manag-
ing the technology. Small businesses are aware of their data being on the cloud and 
the associated risks. According to the National Small Business Association 2013 
survey, 43 % of small businesses use cloud computing and this is a significant jump 
from the 2010 cloud usage rate of 5 % (NSBA 2013).
Most of the small businesses are in manufacturing certain parts for a larger com-
pany or into services. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees tend to use 
information systems primarily for email and record keeping. Since their needs are 
very minimal they do not try to use the cloud service. Small businesses with more 
than 50 employees use cloud services more. Over 6 million small businesses used 
the cloud service as a way to make their presence known. The analogy for small 
businesses in the use of cloud IT is similar to using package delivery services such 
as UPS and FedEx to augment their core strengths. Since small businesses usually 
partner with a large company and provide a single product, they focus more on 
keeping the cost down. When large manufacturers in the automotive sector want 
their suppliers to use certain advanced technology, the only cost effective solution 
for the small companies is the use of cloud services. With supply chain becoming 
critical for large businesses, the small business partners tend to use the cloud ser-
vices in order to have access to advanced technologies.
In order to use cloud services a business must be aware of what is available on 
the cloud and how it would benefit the business. For a working definition, we would 
classify a business with less than 250 employees as Small Business. Businesses with 
250–500 employees as Medium Sized Business and with over 500 employees will 
be classified as a Large Business. Enterprise level businesses tend to have several 
thousand employees spread over multiple countries. Of the three types of standard 
services available on the cloud—SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS—only SaaS is most appro-
priate for small businesses. Many businesses that use PaaS are application develop-
ers. Large businesses tend to use IaaS more than the other two types of services, 
even though they use specialized applications of SaaS such as Customer Relations 
Management (CRM) over the cloud and PaaS service for development testing. 
There are two primary deployment models that are popular with many businesses. 
These are public cloud, the most used by small businesses, and the private cloud, 
most used by large businesses. Cloud service gives the opportunity for many entre-
preneurs to be service marketers on the cloud without having to manage any cloud 
of their own. Two other deployment models that are also prevalent are the hybrid 
cloud and the community cloud. The hybrid cloud helps primarily large businesses 
as they use the private cloud located on premise for sensitive applications and use 
the public cloud for less sensitive applications to meet their service needs. The com-
munity cloud is focused on industry verticals such as health care, automotive and 
finance sectors. Third party service providers focus their expertise in a particular 
industry such as health care and make the services comply with requirements such 
as HIPAA. By keeping their service open only to a specific industry segment they 
are able to ­enhance data security and service sharing. One unintended benefit of the 

103
6.2  Benefits to Business
community cloud is akin to the growth of internet in the early years when only cer-
tain major organizations belonged to the internet and so there was a shared security.
The largest of the cloud service providers is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Many 
entrepreneurs contract for AWS services in order to provide a focused and beneficial 
service to small businesses that lack the expertise to know what they would need 
from a cloud service. If a small business needs an enterprise level application then 
the place to get that application is on the cloud because it would be prohibitively ex-
pensive otherwise. Medium sized businesses tend to use the cloud both for SaaS and 
PaaS. However, public cloud is still their choice for services because of the many 
benefits it offers. Unlike small businesses that have minimal security concerns when 
using a cloud service, medium sized businesses take steps to protect their data on 
the cloud. Medium sized businesses also work with large businesses as partners, 
especially in manufacturing. The three industries in which medium sized businesses 
have a significant presence are Health Care, Financial Service and Manufacturing.
Large businesses and Enterprise level organizations use all three types of cloud 
services—SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. They have the expertise and resources to manage 
their computing platforms. However, these large businesses prefer to have capital 
fluidity and so using cloud computing gives them the ability to switch the Capex 
costs to Opex costs. They tend to use private clouds more than public clouds be-
cause of their sensitivity to data security and data loss prevention. Many large busi-
nesses tend to use public cloud services for less sensitive applications and customer 
facing services. Their primary need for PaaS service is for testing purposes using a 
variety of operating environments. Because large businesses can handle their own 
computing systems and because of security concerns with cloud data storage, the 
cloud adoption rate among large businesses is relatively lower when compared to 
small and medium sized businesses. Gartner Research and other research studies 
show that major cloud service providers are not focused on large businesses for 
promoting the cloud service.
Cloud computing is maturing slowly, with new standards being developed that 
will facilitate service switching. Even though theoretically it is feasible to switch 
service from one cloud service provider to another, it has not been practical. One 
typical issue is the format in which data is stored in cloud service. In the absence of 
global standards, major service providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google use 
proprietary APIs. There is a significant push towards open standards in the form of 
Open Stack Operating System and business consortium efforts such as the Cloud 
Security Alliance (CSA) guidelines (Open Stack 2011; CSA 2014). The Open Stack 
cloud community spans over 130 countries and is supported by major cloud service 
providers such as Rackspace and HP.
6.2  Benefits to Business
Acceptance of any new technology hinges on the benefits to the organization. Cloud 
computing offerings started in 2006. Since then the service is promoted as shift-
ing the management of an information system from the organization to the cloud 

104
6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
­service provider. Inherent benefits of such a move is the service availability, ­meeting 
demand elasticity, metered service, security and access to advanced services. All 
these claims are real benefits to an organization and so the cloud adoption rate has 
steadily increased over the years to over 75 % with a Compound Annual Growth 
Rate (CAGR) of 25 %. In certain developing countries such as India the CAGR is 
projected to be close to 35 % (Gartner 2013) The cloud adoption is not limited to 
U.S. only. In Europe, the cloud adoption is significant both with businesses and 
governments (Interxion 2013). Virtualization is at the top of cloud services. This 
concept has helped with the significant increase in server utilization rate. As men-
tioned earlier, the adoption of a particular type of cloud service varies by size of the 
organization. Small businesses tend to use Software as a Service more. Medium 
sized businesses use Software as a Service and Platform as a Service more. Large 
businesses tend to use Infrastructure as a Service more. Public cloud deployments 
are popular with small and medium sized businesses where as large businesses tend 
to favor private cloud deployments because of the service control and security it 
offers. With the growth in technology the trend is that hybrid clouds will dominate 
the adoption patterns by large businesses. Gartner Research projects that by 2016 
hybrid cloud will be the principal cloud deployment model for large businesses. It 
is to be noted that large businesses serve two roles—cloud users and cloud provid-
ers. In their role as cloud users they focus on how, when and where to use the cloud 
service but not on the management of the hardware and software that make up the 
cloud. In their role as cloud providers they focus exclusively on the management 
aspects of the hardware and software.
Businesses of all sizes benefit from the cloud service. Small and medium sized 
businesses that could not afford high end computing services are able to use such 
services over the cloud. Because of economies of scale the cloud service providers 
are able to provide such services on a pay-per-use basis. Major businesses such as Mi-
crosoft and Adobe have started offering their primary products over the cloud without 
the complex licensing requirements. Microsoft Office 365 consists of all the applica-
tions in their Office Suite and it is available over the internet. Consequently the end 
user need not keep up with the upgrades to the software as well as service patches that 
come regularly. Adobe’s Creative Cloud provides access to their popular PDF and 
Photo Shop suite of products. It facilitates collaboration with other users and sharing 
the creative works easily with thousands of other users over the cloud quickly. In a 
non-cloud setting these would be prohibitively expensive for the ordinary user but 
also will not have the ability to collaborate and share their work with others.
Cloud computing’s primary strategy of pay-as-you-go is both a benefit and 
drawback. As this industry matures it will focus on the need to have price stability 
for businesses. It is true that businesses save cost using the pay-as-you-go model 
because they pay only for what they consume. However, what is not quite apparent 
is the cost of the service. A business that starts out using a particular application 
service such as CRM does not have the price protection guarantee over an extended 
period of time that is common in contract services. Furthermore, even with SLAs 
the cloud service providers change the terms of the contract with 30-day or 45-day 
notice. In the absence of the flexibility to move their service to a different service 

105
6.2  Benefits to Business
provider customers are forced to accept the higher cost for the same service. This 
hidden aspect of cost spike over a short period of time makes the cloud customer not 
realize the cost savings anticipated in using the cloud service. Studies have shown 
that the cost savings of Software as a Service disappear after 2 years. The cloud 
computing contracts generally favor the service provider.
Core requirement for any business is the ability to communicate with their inter-
nal employees and customers quickly and easily. Like other popular email products 
such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail, Microsoft Exchange offers the Outlook mail server. 
With over 400 million users worldwide, Microsoft Exchange is used by businesses 
of all types. Managing an Exchange server is both complex and expensive. Since 
this service is available over the cloud, businesses can subscribe to the service eas-
ily and pay for what they use. Likewise, another popular application is database 
services. SQL Server is one such database system and it is available over the cloud. 
Another important cloud service has been the Customer Relations Management 
(CRM) application. Salesforce is the leader in this multi-billion dollar CRM appli-
cation service. These trends clearly show that more and more popular services are 
offered over the cloud and so businesses have the ability to subscribe these high end 
services at a fraction of the cost (Catteddu, 2010).
Typically medium sized and large businesses are very concerned about security of 
cloud service. The concern is more widespread among large businesses more than the 
medium sized businesses. Usually small businesses do not attach great importance 
to security aspects of the cloud service. Surveys show that the cloud service adop-
tion rate is lower among large businesses because of their security concerns. These 
concerns are addressed by cloud service providers by making available suitable APIs 
that support security. The primary requirement for large businesses is their ability to 
control access to their stored data in the cloud. The newer APIs extend the organiza-
tional access controls through the use of Single Sign On whereby a temporary one 
time password is generated based on the customer identity. Such one-time passwords 
protect the organizational control over user identity and they are not shared over the 
cloud. One such API is McAfee Pledge Software Token (McAfee 2014).
Another major benefit of cloud service is the high level of automation built into 
service provisioning. This helps the cloud service customer to use on demand com-
puting resources and storage capacity. From the user perspective the automation is a 
significant benefit since the customer can configure their cloud service rapidly and 
deploy them quickly. A classic instance of rapid deployment of additional resources 
as needed is highlighted by the Animoto experience. As a cloud service provider for 
a specific application, namely a video service, Animoto experienced tremendous 
growth. It needed to grow from 50 servers to 3,500 servers over a 3 day period using 
AWS’ Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2) service. Since its AWS cloud service had high 
level of automation it was able to use the necessary computing power quickly and 
meet its demand (Bezos 2008).
The data growth has been exponential for many businesses. Even though the 
cost of storage has come down dramatically, costing only a few cents per gigabyte 
of storage, the associated cost of protecting and managing stored data is significant. 
Typical with any data storage is backup and recovery as well as security of data at 

106
6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
rest. These are all expensive propositions for a business to undertake. A cost effec-
tive alternative is the cloud storage. Amazon Web Services provides a very popular 
storage service known as the Simple Storage Service (S3). Other storage services 
available in the cloud are Microsoft’s SkyDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, Apple 
iCloud and Box. All these services offer some free storage and then a tiered service 
plan. The primary benefit of using cloud storage is not only the benefit of expand-
ing storage when needed but also contracting storage when not needed. The cloud 
storage service provider is responsible for data backup and recovery. The security 
of data storage is the responsibility of the cloud service provider with certain exclu-
sions. It is important to realize that the cloud service provider will not be aware of 
the sensitivity nature of the data stored in their devices. It is up to the businesses to 
restrict access to the storage through access control. Typical access control meth-
ods available are Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute Based Access 
Control (ABAC). RBAC helps the business with a simplified access management. 
The ABAC model, on the other hand, is a logical access control model that evalu-
ates the access request against the attributes of entities, objects and the environment 
before granting or denying a request (NIST 2013). ABAC is more fine-grained than 
RBAC. The service provider’s obligations for data protection are limited to unau-
thorized access of stored data because of multi-tenancy.
Cloud services support business continuity aspects by storing customer data in 
a location different from where the business is located. Since the business accesses 
their cloud service using the Internet, they could be up and running from a different 
location after a disaster because the access methods did not change. Thus, cloud 
services inherently provide business continuity feature automatically. However, this 
should not be taken for granted as more businesses are dependent on cloud storage 
and they sometimes become unavailable due to natural disasters such as the Japa-
nese tsunami and the effect of hurricane Sandy on the US East Coast with regard 
to utility power. Based on the possibility of disasters of this scale some companies 
have developed more resilient processes to guarantee business continuity. One such 
is Netflix’s Chaos Monkey process which helps the company randomly remove one 
key component of the service plane and still expect the service to continue oper-
ating. This proactive step helped Netflix continue its service without interruption 
when AWS experienced a significant service outage in one of its US East Coast 
data centers which Netflix uses for its cloud offering. It is important to recognize 
that AWS provides service to other major cloud service providers such as Dropbox, 
Foursquare, Pinterest and Flickr.
Another benefit for businesses in using cloud services is their ability to comply 
with government regulations and industry standards. This is because the cloud ser-
vice providers acquire compliance certifications for HIPAA, SOX, GLBA, FISMA, 
SAS 70 and PCI DSS. When a cloud customer needs to provide any of these com-
pliance data, they are able to access the necessary data logs and gather the required 
data to satisfy their compliance requirements. In some cases, the cloud service 
providers also acquire international certifications such as ISO 27001, Safe Harbor 
Agreement Compliance, and ISAE 3402 Audit Standard compliance. These inter-
national certifications help the large businesses because of their global presence. 
We conclude this section with a summary of the business benefits discussed above, 
based on the type of business (Table 6.1).

6.3  Risks of Cloud Computing
6.3  Risks of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing helps the business growth seamlessly through easy service provi-
sioning. At the same time, the cloud service introduces several types of risks that the 
business must be prepared for when using the cloud service. Some of these risks are 
unique to cloud service as they are not part of a customer controlled computing en-
vironment (Srinivasan 2014). The first risk is the lack of control over the computing 
infrastructure. This includes the possibility of data leakage during processing. This 
arises because of server virtualization which supports multi-tenancy of different 
customers on a single physical server. Virtualization is at the heart of cloud services 
and the service providers take precautions to protect data leakage. But, businesses 
have to treat this risk seriously. Small and medium sized businesses may not have 
an alternative for this. Large businesses may be able to overcome this risk through 
the use of a private cloud. A second risk is due to security and privacy controls on 
the cloud. Cloud service providers do not consider that it is their responsibility to 
protect and secure customer data. This is one of the conclusions of the Poenmon 
Institute survey on cloud security (Ponemon Institute 2011). The primary reason for 
this thinking on the part of the cloud service provider is that they are unaware of the 
nature of data stored in their infrastructure. Since it is a security and privacy risk, 
the cloud customer is responsible for protecting this information (Weinman 2012, 
Gellman 2009). Encryption is one method available for this type of protection. In 
that case the encryption key should be stored at the customer site.
A third risk involves service management by the cloud service provider. This re-
lates to the number of privileged users at the service provider who have access to the 
servers in which the customer’s applications and data reside. Also, the service pro-
vider should create automatic logs of all service provider access to server instances. 
Next, the cloud customer should be able to access this data on demand. Even though

the customer may not be able to control this risk, at least the customer will be able 
to point out the cause for any data loss should a rogue administrator cause such data 
loss. The fourth risk relates to regulatory compliance. This risk should not be of ma-
jor concern for the cloud customer because the cloud service providers invariably 
seek such compliance certifications on their own because of competition among the 
providers and maintaining their reputation. The typical compliance certifications 
come from Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Sar-
banes–Oxley Act (SOX), Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), Federal Information 
Security Management Act (FISMA), SAS 70 (Statement on Accounting Standards 
70) Type II Audit, PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry—Data Security Standard) re-
quirements, and Safe Harbor Agreement with the European Union concerning data 
privacy protection. However, the cloud customer who has a need to provide evi-
dence of compliance for any of these requirements should be able to gather the nec-
essary data from the service provider through automatic logs and security policies 
in force. With many major and minor cloud service providers offering their cloud 
service globally, they may need to have some global compliance certifications as 
well. Some such certifications available are ISAE 3402 and ISO 27001. ISAE 3402 
is simply the international equivalent of customer controls that is measured by the 
SAS 70 Type II Audit extension, known as SSAE 16 (Statement on Standards for 
Attestation Engagements 16).
A fifth risk is cloud outages and service availability. This risk is no less when 
the data is kept in-house by companies. The question is how quickly the company 
can access the data stored for its business use. Infrastructure capacity and resource 
availability favors the cloud service provider to restore service faster than the cloud 
customer if they were to host the data in their own data centers. A recent study by 
a panel of industry and academic experts on outages concluded that the major out-
ages since 2007 among 13 cloud service providers resulted in a total downtime of 
568 h with an economic loss estimated at $ 72 million (Kopytoff 2012). Most cloud 
service providers tout their service availability at 99.95 %. This would mean that the 
service could only be down 21 min per month. Reality is that the service providers 
are not able to offer such high service availability. The consequence is that they 
have to credit the customer for missing the service guarantee. Cloud service provid-
ers have modified their guarantees in one of two ways to deal with this problem. 
Either they require the customer to choose multiple Availability Zones for the SLA 
(means higher cost to the customer) or change the measurement period for 99.95 % 
from month to a year. This simple change has allowed the service provider to have 
up to 4 h downtime per year, thus averaging out their service availability over 12 
months instead of per month. Such outages cause serious reputation issues for the 
business, as the end user would hold the application provider responsible and not 
be worried about where the application is emanating from in order to provide the 
service. Related to this risk is data breach, which is the sixth risk that we consider. 
Over the past 5 years data breaches have occurred with or without the use of a cloud 
service provider. When the data breach occurs at the cloud service provider level 
it involves many businesses, not just one business. Every one of these incidents 
­affects the reputation of the cloud customer and possibly leads to identity theft of its 

109
6.3  Risks of Cloud Computing
end users. For this reason the data breaches also have a financial consequence for 
the cloud customer. These two risks discussed above related to the availability of 
customer data when needed. Along the same lines there is a much more serious risk 
where the cloud service provider is unable to provide the service due to financial 
reasons or violation of some law that resulted in the service being shut down by law 
enforcement. We treat this as the seventh risk facing the customer. One such inci-
dent happened when the cloud storage company Nirvanix shut down in 2013 and all 
its customers had to get their data out of Nirvanix in a hurry.
Cloud services promote their service as pay-as-you-go. Theoretically this gives 
the cloud customer the freedom to use any cloud service they like. In reality, most 
cloud services require a certain period of commitment for an application such as 
CRM or email. Moreover, during the time the customer uses the service the as-
sociated data gets stored in proprietary format of the service provider. Even if the 
customer were to think of migrating to a different cloud service provider, moving 
the existing data in a readable format is time consuming and expensive. The one 
possible exception to this is the use of AWS cloud service. Since AWS is the largest 
cloud service provider, many other cloud service providers provide APIs for transfer 
of service from AWS, should the customer want. The above discussion is the eighth 
risk that we consider and it is commonly known as data lock-in (US-CERT 2012).
Cloud service providers, because of their many compliance certifications and 
voluntary reporting to the Cloud Security Alliance’s Security, Trust and Assurance 
Registry (STAR), have several log data. The ninth risk is related to lack of access to 
this kind of data. Cloud service providers are reluctant for third party audit of their 
infrastructure management and policy enforcement. Since they serve many custom-
ers it would be a major distraction if they were to subject themselves to every cus-
tomer’s third party audit. However, they should be willing to share all such log data 
that they have that would satisfy the customers’ needs. Since this is not a standard 
practice the cloud customer should insist on such data as part of their Service Level 
Agreement (SLA) prior to signing up for cloud service.
We will conclude this section with a brief analysis of the ways to mitigate the 
risks identified above. One way to mitigate the risk of service becoming unavail-
able when needed is to use a second cloud service provider for data backup, not the 
same provider. This approach also helps with possible switching of service later to 
this service provider. The credits offered per SLA violation is miniscule compared 
to the loss of income to the business when the site is unavailable. It would be better 
for cloud customers to have independent insurance against loss of income due to 
service outage. Cloud service providers are cooperating with insurers so that they 
could examine the cloud service operation and write their insurance policies ac-
cordingly. Another risk to mitigate is security. Since security concerns are important 
to address, the customer should explore the possibility of having a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) access to the service provider with strong encryption for data at 
rest. This adds cost to the service but at least provides the extra security protection. 
Another option is to consider a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Service providers like 
AWS provide VPCs at an affordable cost. There are also Cloud Service Brokers 
(CSBs) who lookout for the interests of the customer and identify service providers 

110
6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
who are reliable and have solid security practices. Moreover, the CSBs can help 
steer several customers towards an affordable service by negotiating an affordable 
service cost based on overall volume. CSBs are popular in the cloud service indus-
try as they account for over $ 500 million of service cost for the customers. The 
benefits derived from the use of CSBs far outweigh the cost of their service. Many 
cloud service providers use third party service contractors for specific services. In 
such cases customer data is transferred to the third party contractor without notifica-
tion to the cloud customer. Even though the cloud service provider is responsible for 
data protection, data breach potential increases with the exposure to more providers 
involved in the service loop.
6.4  Cost Factors in Cloud Computing
One of the key benefits of cloud computing for businesses is the cost factor. Small 
and medium sized businesses especially place higher emphasis on the cost savings 
aspect of cloud computing because they are able to get high-end computing at an 
affordable cost. The cost component could be divided into explicit costs for service 
and the implicit costs associated with the service. Explicit costs are deterministic 
and the implicit costs have to be estimated. For example, selecting a certain amount 
of storage for a given period of time has a fixed cost whereas the steps a company 
has to take to secure their cloud data is an implicit cost. One reason for this is that 
the resources allocated for such a purpose is likely to be usable in other settings as 
well and so the cost has to be distributed to other areas where the resources are used. 
A 2013 study commissioned by Research in Action shows that 79 % of CIOs are 
concerned about the hidden costs of managing applications in the cloud (Research 
in Action 2013). In this section we will review both the explicit and implicit costs 
associated with cloud computing service.
Cloud service providers promote their service as pay-as-you-go which implies 
that no contract is required. In reality it is not the case. The “pay-as-you-go” model 
comes with a minimum service usage requirement. For example, the largest of the 
cloud services is Amazon Web Services (AWS). The AWS contract requires a cus-
tomer signing up for a public cloud service with certain applications through their 
Software as a Service to use the service for at least 30 days and use two different 
Availability Zones in order for the service availability guarantee to be enforced. 
To understand better the cloud service costs let us introduce certain terms that we 
would refer for service cost. An Availability Zone (AZ) is like a data center. A re-
gion consists of several AZs. Within an AZ there could be compute blocks that are 
allocated for cloud services and cost is measured based on the number of compute 
blocks used. In a public cloud scenario the customer pays for compute blocks used 
within an Availability Zone. Some of the major service providers such as Rack-
space and Microsoft reserve the right to change the contract with a 45 day notice. 
When customers do not have the ease of switching the 45-day notice does not mean 
much, other than a cost increase. Moreover, by requiring two Availability Zones in 

111
6.4  Cost Factors in Cloud Computing
order for the SLA to be enforced for availability, the service provider is expecting 
the customer to pay for more than what they need in the form of a second Avail-
ability Zone. AWS, Google and Salesforce also have similar requirements, but with 
a 30-day advance notice to change the contract. These five companies account for 
an overwhelming majority of cloud services and so we reviewed their costs. It is 
important to note that, except for Salesforce, none of the other companies put a cap 
on the cost increase. That makes it difficult for customers to anticipate the cost of 
cloud service over a longer period of time.
Another teaser from these companies related to cost is based on a limited free 
service tier. Considering the storage cost on the cloud, all major cloud service pro-
viders offer a free storage tier. Table 6.2 shows a comparative view of these costs. 
First, all companies will need far more storage space than that offered though the 
free storage tier. Second, in the absence of global standards, the storage API is pro-
prietary. Cloud service providers charge for data egress always and in some cases 
charge for data ingress as well. These are hidden costs. Third, data storage is not for 
a short period of time. For all practical purposes the storage space used is indefinite 
and growing, even if certain data get deleted after a period of time. Thus, the storage 
cost alone will become significant over a span of 5 years. Moreover, if the cloud 
customer decides to move the storage to another storage service provider then the 
cloud customer has to pay for the bandwidth needed to move the data. Assuming a 
petabyte of stored data (1 million GB) it would take over 3 months to transfer the 
data at the data transfer rate of 1 Gbps. Since this would not be acceptable for many 
businesses a higher data transfer rate would be needed and that would increase the 
cost of moving data from one storage provider to another.
Cloud service provider in their IaaS service provides the customer with the hard-
ware. It is up to the customer to run the applications of their choice in that hardware.

6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
Many customers find the cost of application integration is significant. A large busi-
ness would want integration of their email system with their voice mail system. One 
benefit of this integration is that voice mails could be delivered as email and vice 
versa. Also, when a voice mail is replicated by an email then the voice mail could 
be deleted automatically. To address the integration cost issue in the cloud SAP has 
developed HANA (High-performance ANalytic Appliance) that combines database 
and application capabilities in-memory for a high-speed response. Another hidden 
cost of cloud computing involves the need to test applications for cloud use. If the 
application provider does not provide this feature then businesses that migrate their 
services to the cloud will have to develop the necessary interfaces. Two other hid-
den costs are with respect to set up of cloud service and service trials. The cloud 
service provider emphasizes the ongoing cost advantages of the cloud service but 
the customer has to transition their service to the cloud and there is significant cost 
involved with that. Often service trials turn into service if the business does not 
watch out for the conditions under which a trial becomes a service. Businesses have 
to realize that once they move a service to the cloud the cost savings up front may 
not last long. This is because the service will be in use for many years and so the 
cloud costs will be recurring. Some businesses are finding that using cloud services 
for the longer run is not cost effective.
Cost of IT services is closely watched by businesses. That is one reason cloud 
computing is closely looked at by businesses, especially small and medium sized 
businesses. In this section we have concentrated so far on how much services cost 
in cloud computing. The ultimate goal is to have cost savings. With this in mind 
we can look at the evolution of cloud computing at an industrialized service scale. 
Businesses saved up to 30 % by outsourcing and offshoring IT services. Because 
of high levels of customization and people centered activity, the savings could not 
increase or the service scale up. Cloud computing on the other hand was designed 
with standardized service offered over the internet with high levels of automation. 
This provided comparable savings but had the additional advantage of scaling up. 
The cloud computing industry is working towards global standards that will help 
offer industrialized services that help the customer to switch between service pro-
viders easily (Cloud Industry Forum 2014). The two areas where this savings would 
be noticeable are email service and storage over the cloud. The barrier to significant 
growth in these two areas is due to the security and privacy concerns. Major cloud 
service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google are focused on consumer 
rather than corporate clients. Cloud computing will emerge over the next 5 years 
with many security and privacy compliance features built-in. This will accelerate 
the adoption of more cloud services leading to significant cost savings for busi-
nesses.
So far we looked at several of the explicit costs associated with cloud computing. 
There are some implicit costs that also impact the continued use of cloud service. 
One such involves security. Businesses have a robust authentication mechanism for 
access control for their employees based on in-house management of this service. It 
will not be advisable to move this service to the cloud for security reasons. More-
over, businesses want to safeguard their authentication data. One way to accomplish 

113
6.5  Variation on Outsourcing
this is to use a third party API which integrates with the internal authentication 
system and generates a one-time password that is used to control access to other ap-
plications on the cloud. If VPN is used for secure cloud access, then that cost should 
be distributed to other applications that also use the VPN service. Site mirroring 
is another service that benefits cloud service availability but also helps with email 
service availability and the cost benefit extends beyond the cloud service. Typical 
variations in service agreements are with respect to public versus private clouds. 
In public clouds the risk factor corresponds to the grace period at the end of the 
contract for accessing the data. Typically 30 days are common during which time 
the data move takes place and during which time the data will be accessible for the 
customer for their applications. There will be cost for such access. The more serious 
risk is with regard to data integrity and data confidentiality, which the cloud service 
provider does not want to assume. Thus the cloud customer will incur additional 
cost to provide these two critical assurances for their data.
6.5  Variation on Outsourcing
Cloud computing technology is viewed for its widespread availability, reliability 
and cost savings. In using the cloud service the business cedes control to the cloud 
service provider. Traditionally businesses let a third party provide a service based 
on their expertise for a fee. For example, pay roll is an outsourced service with 
many small businesses. In a similar way we can consider the cloud service as an 
outsourcer for the business. In this section we will review how cloud computing 
could be viewed as an outsourced service.
There are several similarities and differences between outsourcing and cloud 
computing. Traditional outsourcing takes over a prior function that was performed 
in-house and manages it. The outsourced function may not be done any differently 
by the outsourcer. The customer cedes control on that function to a third party who 
gets the job done. From the business perspective it is done by someone who has an 
expertise in that area. For example, a business that used to process customer credit 
cards for charges to their products or services outsources the credit card process-
ing to a third party that specializes in that area. The outsourcer usually brings in 
more expertise and resources to the function. In a similar way the cloud service 
provider brings more infrastructure resources through economies of scale and of-
fers the cloud service to the cloud customer. In the traditional outsourcing model 
the customer retains control over the outcome of the outsourced service. They have 
the ability to intervene much faster. However, in the cloud computing model the 
customer lacks control over the computing infrastructure. Even though theoreti-
cally they can move the service in-house, it is not practical. The cost factor in that 
case would be very high for the customer and they will lose valuable time providing 
the service. In other words, service lock-in is not very common with outsourcing 
whereas it is much more prevalent with cloud services.

114
6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
One other similarity between outsourcing and cloud service is that they both can 
offer their specialized service to a variety of customers. This capability provides 
them with the ability to have economies of scale advantage in pricing their service. 
For example, the payroll giant ADP provides payroll services to a large number of 
customers globally. Because of their size they are able to command a better price 
from their suppliers. Both the outsourcer and the cloud service provider have the 
ability to provide data to the customer to meet their compliance requirements. Usu-
ally the customer is good at what they do and they need several attendant services 
such as payroll and credit card processing. Both the outsourcer and the cloud ser-
vice provider help the customer by taking over the management of this important 
service for them. When a service is outsourced, the organization loses their in-house 
expertise in these areas.
Both outsourcing and cloud computing introduce several risk management is-
sues for the organization. In the outsourced model the outsourcer entirely performs 
the outsourced function. On the other hand, in the cloud computing model, the 
business simply uses the resources in the public or private cloud. The applications 
used or still the same but how they are used differ significantly. One of the key 
challenges in the cloud service model is the integration of various applications on 
the cloud. The business organization is ultimately responsible for all compliance 
requirements irrespective of the service being outsourced or moved to the cloud. 
Often the reason for outsourcing is the lack of expertise within the business to 
perform the business function. For example, a small banking institution needs to 
offer electronic banking for its customers. Otherwise, they would lose customers. 
In order to offer electronic banking the small bank needs to put in place highly 
secure practices and protect the servers through which the service is offered. This 
is cost prohibitive as well as the organization may not have the people resources to 
manage this high level of security. On the other hand the small bank has the abil-
ity to outsource the online banking aspect to a third party that specializes in that 
service. This is a viable business option. From the third party perspective, they are 
able to distribute the high cost of security among the many businesses that use their 
service. Since security is their primary focus they are able to keep up with all the 
advancements in technology in that field. The cost of this type of service is afford-
able for the small bank. However, if the small bank were to consider moving their 
online banking to the cloud, it still would be responsible for service management. 
The cloud provider only offers the resources. Hence, outsourcing is the preferred 
solution in this scenario.
Traditional outsourcing is highly customized and the IT services delivery is 
locked in for a specified period of time, usually 3 years. Because of customization 
and the service lock-in period there is very little innovation coming out of tradition-
al outsourcing models. They meet the current needs of the business customer but do 
not explore alternatives to deliver the service cheaper or better. Cloud computing by 
design is standardized, which is at the other end of the spectrum for flexible design. 
The standardization enables the cloud customer to subscribe to a service in a few 
hours to days as opposed to months it takes to make an outsourcing arrangement 
to work. Since there is much competition in the cloud service, innovation is key 

115
6.5  Variation on Outsourcing
to success from the service provider perspective. Traditional outsourcing is more 
people and asset based that has a 1-to-1 arrangement with the outsourcer. On the 
other hand, cloud computing is more standardized in its offerings, with the ability 
to use much of the services in an automated manner. By design, the cloud comput-
ing model is 1-to-many service through multi-tenancy and virtualization. Unlike 
traditional outsourcing, cloud computing follows the pay-as-you-go model. This 
means that the customer is not locked in for an extended period of time with the 
service provider. Another drawback of traditional outsourcing is that the solution 
does not scale quickly. The hallmark of cloud computing is its scalability. A Gartner 
Research study shows that businesses spend 53 % of their IT budget on outsourced 
services. This spending growth is at 4 % annually. Cloud computing has opened up 
several possibilities for businesses of all sizes to use high-end computing at an af-
fordable cost and its growth rate is nearly three times that of traditional outsourcing. 
So, more businesses are using cloud computing because of the standardized offer-
ings over the public cloud and the availability of commonly needed applications via 
the Software as a Service.
In certain sectors such as health care and finance the audit requirements are strin-
gent. The business in one such sector that uses an outsourcer or a cloud service 
provider would still be responsible for providing the audit data for compliance pur-
poses. In the case of the outsourcer the business will be able to obtain the necessary 
audit data for internal controls and data access controls. If a cloud service provider 
is used, the business will have to rely on the provider’s compliance certifications 
and audit data. If such data does not address the specific requirements of the busi-
ness, then the business will have great difficulty obtaining such data through a third 
party audit of the cloud service provider. From a practical perspective, as the pro-
vider of services to many customers, the cloud service provider cannot expose their 
systems to third party audit of all its customers. In such a case the cloud service 
model may not be the best solution for the business. The outsourcer model is more 
nimble compared to the cloud service model in this regard.
Businesses that enter into a relationship with either the outsourcer or the cloud 
service provider need assurance that at the expiration of the service contract all data 
pertaining to the business are deleted. Considering the cloud service model, data is 
backed up and replicated in multiple locations for data availability. The business 
has the option of choosing a data storage region on the cloud. However, the busi-
ness is unaware of where the data gets backed up. For this reason, the business may 
not have processes in place that could verify the deletion of all data with the cloud 
service provider. On the other hand, the outsourcer will be able to provide such 
a verification because their functions are performed regionally. Moreover, in the 
cloud service model the service provisioning happens over the internet and so it is 
accessible for businesses globally (FFIEC 2014). The customer base is very large 
in the cloud service model compared to the outsourcer model. The execution of the 
outsourcer model still has a regional focus and the number of customers is much 
smaller compared to the cloud service model. For this reason, the outsourcer model 
has the advantage of providing the necessary verification that all data are deleted at 
the termination of contract.

116
6  Assessing Cloud Computing for Business Use
Even though the outsourcer model and the cloud service model are two dif-
ferent types of services, there is a high probability that the outsourcer might use 
some form of cloud service. In this case the business needs to verify that the cloud 
service used by the outsourcer is a private cloud. This is feasible for the outsourc-
er because of the volume of service to multiple customers. The outsourcer will be 
able to provide suitable assurances and validation data to the customer concern-
ing data security and privacy of information. From a compliance perspective the 
customer will be able to verify that there is data isolation in the private cloud in 
spite of server virtualization. Since all services in the private cloud are controlled 
by the single entity, the outsourcer, there is security and privacy guarantee in this 
model.
Cloud computing is considered to be disrupting the outsourcing industry. Data 
for 2013 reveals the IT outsourcing has increased. The disruptive nature of cloud 
computing is noticeable both in IT Outsourcing (ITO) and Business Process Out-
sourcing (BPO). In the case of ITO, the preference is for Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS) which gives greater control for the business in using the cloud services. For 
BPO, the preference is for Software as a Service (SaaS). The reason for this is that 
the SaaS market is highly mature in Email, CRM and HR (ISG 2014). Moreover, 
the ISG study shows that the ITO growth is significant over the past 3 years. Small 
and medium sized businesses are using ITO more. The leading SaaS providers in 
these markets are Microsoft and Google for Email, Salesforce for CRM and Work-
day for HR. According to the Deloitte Global Outsourcing and Insourcing Survey, 
IT Outsourcing is the most outsourced business function at 76 %. The primary rea-
son for ITO is the need to reduce costs. In this regard cloud computing is also a 
beneficial option (Deloitte 2012).
6.6  Summary
Cloud computing has a significant market penetration. Small and medium sized 
businesses find greater acceptance of the risks associated with cloud computing. 
Cloud computing’s benefits to businesses are significant. Many of the benefits offer 
the businesses access to high-end computing services on demand. The availability 
of services and cost benefits enable the customer to choose the services needed. It 
is important to realize that there are many risks to the customer associated with the 
choice of cloud computing, along with the many benefits. To mitigate these risks 
the customer has to spend additional financial resources, which reduces the cost 
savings by switching to cloud from in-house computing. For this reason many large 
businesses are still hesitant to switch their services to the cloud. Some of the ma-
jor benefits of demand elasticity and service availability of cloud computing allow 
large businesses to choose private cloud service. This also enhances security and 
privacy as well as affords the large business to control their computing environ-
ment. We discussed at length how cloud computing is considered as a variation on 
traditional outsourcing, which the businesses are accustomed to using. The trend in 
IT outsourcing points to the development of industrialized IT services that are of-

cloud services.

Abstract  Cloud service providers offer a contract to their customers. The contracts 
do not deviate much from one another. The cloud service provider prefers the con-
tract to be executed as a click-through online. In a way the cloud service providers 
keep the contract standard without customization. There are two main reasons for 
the standard contract. First, the services are standardized and the customer has the 
full range of services to look at and decide on the services that they want. Second, 
with numerous customers it will be impossible to manage customized contracts that 
differ from one another. Review of the standard contract reveals that the Service 
Level Agreement (SLA) does not give the customer much recourse. Invariably the 
SLAs favor the service provider. There is a new trend among cloud service provid-
ers and customers to seek insurance to mitigate the risks. In this chapter we look at 
the many hidden aspects of a cloud contract and point out where clarity is needed. 
Cloud service providers have privileged users who have the potential to access cus-
tomer data on the cloud. The standard contract does not specify how privileged 
users will be monitored. Also important to the customer is the ability to switch 
service providers and move data across providers easily. This requires the service 
provider to have the resources to support high speed data transfer in a standardized 
format. We will look at the provisions made in the contract for such a move.

7.1  Introduction
Cloud computing is evolving rapidly as an effective alternative to in-house comput-
ing. The cost advantages and service availability make it an attractive alternative for 
many small and medium-sized businesses. Since cloud services are provided by a 
third party every business needs a contract to codify all the service guarantees of the 
service provider. Many businesses consider a variation on outsourcing. Typically in 
outsourcing the contract is customized to the customer needs. Moreover, it takes a 
significant time before the outsourced service becomes available to the customer. 
In the cloud service model the customer is able to select from a set of standardized 
services available over the internet and select a cloud service provider. The service 
becomes operational within a few hours or at most a few days. Because of the stan-

7  Hidden Aspects of a Cloud Computing Contract
120
dardized nature of the service the cloud service providers offer a standard contract. 
A review of several contracts shows that there is not much variation among the 
contracts. More striking is the fact that many of the provisions in a cloud contract 
favor the service provider, with very little remedy for the cloud customer. A cloud 
customer chooses the cloud service based on the fact that the service provider has 
the advantage of economies of scale and so they are in a better position to offer an 
affordable service that is up virtually all the time. Small and medium-sized busi-
nesses will have great difficulty managing their own computing system that is up 
virtually up all the time, let alone the cost factors. Large businesses, on the other 
hand, have many resources available and so they could use their own computing 
system and supplement that with additional resources from a cloud service provider.
When a business chooses cloud sourcing they want the service to be reliable 
and available nearly all the time. To support this feature the cloud service providers 
offer a service uptime guarantee of 99.95 %. This means that the service could be 
down only for 21 min a month in order to have such a high level of up time. This 
level of service guarantee is typical from all the major cloud service providers such 
as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Google, Rackspace and Salesforce. 
All these service providers had service outages over the last 5 years. On many of 
these outages the service was unavailable for several days. This clearly was not in 
line with the service guarantee. Typically service contracts have provisions that 
when a service guarantee is not honored then the service provider incurs a pen-
alty to compensate the customer for lack of service. In the case of cloud service 
contracts, because there is so little variation from the standard contract, the cloud 
service provider includes provisions that will protect them from paying any penalty 
to the customer. The cloud contract specifies that in order for the service guarantee 
to be honored the cloud customer must choose multiple Availability Zones (AZs). 
An Availability Zone contains both computing resources such as servers, applica-
tions and storage devices. Each service provider divides their service into multiple 
regions around the world and places several AZs in each region. This is more of 
a requirement from a legal perspective because many foreign governments pro-
hibit storage of data of their citizens outside their borders. The common regions are 
North America (US, Canada, Mexico), Latin America, Europe-Middle East-Africa 
(EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC).
We mentioned above certain standard regions. This grouping of countries by 
region is by no means accepted by all cloud service providers. There are several 
variations in the countries included in a region based on the service focus of the 
cloud service provider. Because of the constraints of USA PATRIOT Act and the 
recently disclosed NSA data surveillance, many foreign governments do not want 
their country data in regions accessible to the US Government. Europe has specific 
Safe Harbor provisions that protect the data privacy of their citizens (Safe Harbor-
EU 2000). Within Europe, Switzerland has some additional Safe Harbor require-
ments. These are codified in a separate Safe Harbor Agreement with Switzerland 
(Safe Harbor-Swiss 2008). In situations described above the cloud customer may 
need modification of contract to reflect that data privacy concerns will be accom-
modated. According to Hon, Millard and Walden, most cloud service providers are 

7.1  Introduction
121
not willing to modify their contracts for lower end customers on the level of service 
used (Hon 2012).
The primary purpose of seeking changes in the contract is to reduce the risk for 
the business. Another trend emerging as an alternative to contract modification is 
insurance. From the cloud customer perspective the insurance seeks to mitigate the 
damage caused by loss of data, security breach or service availability. Hon et al. 
point out that in many cases the cloud providers are seeking insurance against cus-
tomer claims for service disruption. Thus, a new service industry is emerging to 
provide insurance service to the cloud service providers and customers. Use of such 
a service adds to the cost of using cloud service to the customer which in many 
cases would nullify the cost savings. Insurers insist on certain compliance certifi-
cations before offering their service. Also, the cloud service providers are willing 
to cooperate with the insurance carriers in the form of allowing them to gather the 
data they need on the service management aspect. This is noteworthy because the 
cloud service providers are not willing to allow third party audit of their services at 
customer request.
It is a fact that most cloud service providers are unwilling to modify their standard 
contract. The customer ends up with a standard contract that is generated through 
a process called “click-through” during service setup. Getting a contract through 
“click-through” is considered a sign that the industry has not matured enough to 
negotiate specific contracts. This general thinking will not be applicable to cloud 
services because of their design to offer utility computing with easy access to their 
services. Moreover, in order to provide cost advantage to the customer many cloud 
service providers lack the legal resources to have modified contracts. A survey in 
UK by the Cloud Industry Forum showed that nearly half of all cloud contracts were 
not customized (Cloud Industry Forum 2011).
In addition to cloud service providers there are two other groups that are in-
volved in contracts. The first group is Cloud Service Brokers (CSBs). The CSB 
is a significant force in the use of cloud service, especially for small and medium-
sized businesses (SMBs). According to Forrester Research and MarketsandMarkets 
study, the CSB service accounts for over $ 10 billion of IT spending for the cloud 
customers. They have an important role to play in that they look out for features that 
are essential in cloud service and advise cloud customers accordingly. Among the 
SMBs the demand is more for SaaS applications whereas for the larger businesses 
the need is in Infrastructure as a Service. Moreover, as a third party, the CSBs are 
able to find better service rates because of the volume that they can generate among 
the many cloud customers that they have. The CSBs are investing in CapEx to 
provide services to customers who they expect to use their CapEx investment as 
OpEx for them. The second group is Cloud Service Integrators (CSIs). A CSI of-
fers service integration features for the cloud customer which goes a step further 
than the advice the CSB typically offers. CSI services are value added for the cloud 
customer because they can integrate the back office work and identity management 
with cloud service. In a way the Cloud Service Brokers are emerging as Cloud Ser-
vice Integrators. Integrators are themselves cloud service providers to SMBs, espe-
cially SaaS applications. The integrators take on some risks in order to retain some

122
customers. Major telcos such as Verizon and AT&T who have a large customer base 
are trying to benefit from the CSBs who can market SaaS solutions over the telco 
infrastructure. Two Cloud Service Integrators are HyperStratus and Appirio.
7.2  Service Level Agreement
Any organization that signs a contract with a service provider should codify the 
service guarantees through a service contract. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) 
is the common instrument for this. Service providers make SLAs favorable to them 
and add constraints that are not possible in software licensing. Such constraints 
are added for increased revenue. For example, Microsoft Office 365 cloud service 
restricts the number of emails that a cloud customer could receive in a day. Exceed-
ing this daily limit would incur cost for the customer. Given the demand for cloud 
services many cloud service providers are not willing to change their standard terms 
for SLAs even for large companies and Cloud Service Integrators. An exception 
occurs where large government entities and financial institutions with compliance 
requirements negotiate on SLA terms. In such cases the volume of business com-
bined with a niche service area attracts the cloud customer to agree to changes 
for the standard terms in their SLAs. Clearly SLAs apply only for paid services. 
It is common practice in many businesses where customers sign up for free cloud 
services with click-through standard terms. Invariably these free services lead to 
other paid services where SLAs are needed. Since the relationship with the provider 
already existed it will be difficult to negotiate any favorable terms in the SLAs for 
the customer.
In SLAs the common expectation is for the provider and customer to limit their 
liabilities. The providers are unwilling to increase their liabilities through SLAs. 
Global customers have a better chance of limiting their liabilities through SLAs but 
the service provider usually accepts only “direct losses” to the customer because 
“indirect losses” may be difficult to verify (Cloud UK 2011). Further, the service 
provider places a cap on the liability limited to a certain percentage of the fees paid 
for the service for a specific period like 1 year. The reason for this approach is that 
most of the services are commoditized. Also, focus on SLAs may not provide the 
necessary protection when the provider may not be credit worthy. It is standard 
practice with cloud service providers to have redundant backups of data. However, 
the provider may not be willing to guarantee through an SLA the data availability 
or integrity. It is usually offered as an add-on service for a fee. Because of this fact 
many customers may not insist on modification to the SLA for data availability. One 
common concern with cloud service is security. To overcome this concern the ser-
vice provider assumes responsibility for data confidentiality violations. However, 
data breach is not considered a data confidentiality violation. Since data breaches 
are more likely to occur than unauthorized access, this aspect of SLA favors the 
service provider.
Cloud service providers emphasize that protecting data and service on the cloud 
requires shared responsibility with customers. The cloud customer using IaaS or 

7.2  Service Level Agreement
123
PaaS service has greater control over their cloud service than a SaaS customer. 
For this reason, the cloud service SLA for IaaS or PaaS need not focus on data 
backup, recovery, security or access control. For SaaS customers this will be dif-
ficult to incorporate in an SLA because of the commoditized nature of the service 
at a low cost. The common mitigation strategy for SaaS service users is the backup 
and recovery service of the integrator who also guarantees data integrity given the 
relatively smaller size of the customer base for such a service when compared to 
the cloud service provider (Geyer and McLellan 2011). Service availability is a 
key metric for businesses of all types but large businesses pay more attention to 
this metric than small and medium-sized businesses. One of the major benefits of 
a cloud service is its very high availability. Yet, when the service is disrupted even 
for a short while, its impact is huge because of the very large customer base that 
is global in nature. Cloud service providers are unwilling to modify their standard 
SLA for availability because they offer the service as a commodity. A major SaaS 
service provider like Salesforce does not offer an SLA and 99.8 % of its customers 
are not particular about an SLA. Regarding service availability, its customers ex-
pect only 99.7 % availability and Salesforce offering has a higher availability rate 
than 99.7 %. For these reasons, it will be difficult to have a customized SLA for 
any cloud service regarding service availability. Moreover, companies like Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) which offer an SLA with service availability insist that SLA 
provisions will be valid only when a customer contracts for service in more than 
one Availability Zone. This indirectly implies that the customer backup their data in 
more than one Availability Zone. AWS service availability data indicates that they 
do not have concurrent failures in multiple availability zones. AWS has also defined 
that their service availability should be measured as a percentage over a period of 
1 year rather than on a month to month basis. Thus, a 99.95 % availability of their 
service which only allows for 21 min of downtime in a month becomes over 4 h 
of downtime spread over 1 year. These changes built-into the provider SLAs make 
them favorable to the service provider.
In mission-critical services the customer wants low latency meaning faster re-
sponse time. Virtually all service providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, 
Rackspace and Salesforce all depend on a telco to provide connectivity. Since they 
do not control the actual communication network they are unwilling to guarantee 
low latency through an SLA. However, a cloud service provider such as Terremark, 
which is owned by the telco Verizon, offers low latency guarantee. Terremark owns 
the NAP of the Americas data center in Miami that provides protection against natu-
ral and man-made disasters. A classic example of high availability, reliability and 
security through Terremark cloud service is the Subway Cash Card management 
program since 2006. The mission-critical nature of this program in North America 
for Subway had maintained 100 % availability through Verizon and Terremark. In 
the case of other cloud service providers who are unable to provide an SLA, some 
service integrators have assumed the risk for a fee and are providing low latency 
guarantee via their own SLA to the customer. Hence, the cloud customer may have 
the option to get an SLA with some of their concerns addressed through an integra-
tor rather than the service provider.

7  Hidden Aspects of a Cloud Computing Contract
124
One of the hidden facts about the efficacy of an SLA is its use in the event of a 
perceived contractual violation. The cloud service providers want to link the SLA 
clauses to parts of their web site that they control and which they amend periodical-
ly without informing the customers. Thus, if the customer had a feature negotiated 
with the service provider then it could be nullified because of its linkage to other 
clauses in the company web site that they could modify to suit their needs. From 
an enforcement perspective, in the event of an SLA remedy, the customer only gets 
service credit based on what they paid for a specific service that was violated. Since 
the payment for such a service is small on a monthly basis, even if a credit were to 
be forthcoming, it would not offset for the customer’s reputation loss, because of 
which they may lose customers of their own if they happen to provide a service. Be-
cause of this aspect of an SLA some large cloud customers simply do not count on 
the SLA to provide any remedy, instead they pay for insurance to cover their risks. 
An SLA requirement for the customer could be transparency in the system perfor-
mance, incident handling and management practices. After several well-publicized 
outages over the past 3 years many cloud service providers are now providing sys-
tem performance data on their web site that anyone could monitor. For example, the 
AWS system performance web site is called AWS Service Health Dashboard (AWS 
2014), Google’s corresponding web site is Apps Status Dashboard (Google 2014), 
Window’s Azure site is Windows Azure Service Dashboard (Microsoft 2014), 
Rackspace site is System Status (Rackspace 2014), and Salesforce site is Analytics 
(Salesforce 2014).
Many cloud customers consider it important for them to know where their data 
is stored and processed. This is a compliance requirement for many customers. For 
this reason the cloud service provider makes available the location of their data cen-
ters for customers to choose from when contracting for cloud service. Even though 
this location information is guaranteed by the service provider in the contract, the 
provider has statements reserving the right to use third party sub-providers. Such 
sub-providers may not be in the area where the data center is located. Consequently, 
some customer data might be transferred to the sub-provider outside of the area 
designated in the contract. Cloud service providers do not consider this a violation 
of the contract and often the customer is unaware of the exact location of their data. 
This ambiguity is typical of the standard click-through contract. Of all the cloud 
service providers only Salesforce has taken the extra step to give the ability for 
the customers to verify where their data is stored and processed by using the web 
site trust.salesforce.com. Many global cloud service providers in US point out that 
the US-Europe and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Agreements provide the necessary legal 
protection for customer compliance. For these reasons, the cloud service provider 
does not modify their standard contract.
Security is considered the top concern by many potential cloud customers across 
multiple surveys (Ponemon Institute 2011; DLA Piper 2012). Cloud providers note 
that those customers who use their Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a 
Service have full control over the cloud infrastructure they use and so they are 
responsible for any security measures needed. In the case of Software as a Ser-
vice the cloud providers note that they have control over the infrastructure. When 

7.2  Service Level Agreement
125
such customers need modification of the standard contract to reflect their security 
needs, the cloud providers resist change of contract. The primary reason cited by 
cloud providers is that too much transparency in their security practices is in itself 
a security threat. For this reason they do not support audit of their security infra-
structure by cloud customers. This argument has some validity. However, the cloud 
providers could facilitate integration of more security solutions with their offer-
ings such as one time passwords. Since this would increase the cost of service the 
cloud providers offer the security solutions for a fee. Another solution offered by 
cloud providers for security practices transparency is their compliance with ISO 
27001 Standard. In lieu of SLA modification the cloud customer could be assured 
of security practices that comply with Cloud Security Alliance Security Standard, 
Cloud Industry Forum Standard and Open Data Center Alliance Standard (CSA 
2011; Cloud Industry Forum 2011; ODCA 2011).
Businesses consider an SLA as important to expect certain level of service from 
the provider. It is standard practice for businesses to negotiate an SLA that meets 
their service expectations. With this goal in mind the legal unit of the business 
may want to get involved in negotiating an SLA. When it comes to cloud service 
this model does not work for several reasons. Cloud service is offered as a utility 
service. The service is available globally to thousands of customers. The customer 
base is often very large and diverse. One of the defining features of cloud service 
is quick deployment. Goal of cloud computing is to keep the cost of service low 
in order to attract more businesses to subscribe to the cloud service. In order to 
keep the cost down the cloud service providers do not have a large legal unit that 
can review unique expectations from its cloud customers. For all these reasons the 
cloud service provider offers only a standard contract that is available online for 
click-through acceptance. Even though a customized SLA is not the norm in cloud 
service, the cloud customer should expect certain details spelled out in the contract. 
One requirement should be to know how and when a contract would terminate. Are 
there provisions for an abnormal termination of contract? As and when the contract 
terminates how will the cloud customer get access to their data and support for 
transfer of data to another source? These are important aspects that must be ad-
dressed in a cloud contract, even a standard contract.
Our discussion shows that cloud customers value an SLA. However, cloud ser-
vice providers do not want to offer any customized SLAs. A quick review of the 
SLAs from AWS, Windows Azure, Google Apps and Rackspace will help under-
stand the main features that service providers support through an SLA. Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud service provider. AWS offers SaaS, PaaS 
and IaaS service types as well as public and private cloud deployment models. 
AWS service uptime is at 99.9 %. Popular AWS service components are Elastic 
Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Block Storage (EBS) and Simple Storage Ser-
vice (S3). AWS data centers are distributed around the world. The data centers 
are grouped into Availability Zones (AZ) and several AZs form a region. AWS’ 
SLA requires the customer to sign up for two AZs in order for the service uptime 
in the SLA to be honored. The service uptime is measured by spreading it over 
a 12 month period instead of on a month to month basis. This gives AWS the 

7  Hidden Aspects of a Cloud Computing Contract
126
­ability to average out their total downtime in any particular month. In the event 
of a claim, the period of measurement starts after the last claim. AWS SLA does 
not make it clear whether they exclude their routine service maintenance times for 
SLA purpose. Since they stagger their routine maintenance times by Availability 
Zones it would appear that they do not exclude the service maintenance times in 
their SLA, because the SLA remedy would apply only for customers who sign up 
for multiple Availability Zones. It is the responsibility of the customer to initiate 
any SLA remedy and that too follow a strict notification time period. AWS offers a 
10 % service credit when the service uptime falls below 99.9 % and a 25 % service 
credit if the service uptime falls below 99 %. All service credits are applicable for a 
future service period. AWS offers a CloudFront and CloudTrail service that would 
help the customer (AWS CloudFront 2014; AWS CloudTrail 2013).
Windows Azure offers a 99.95 % service uptime guarantee. Their service uptime 
guarantee includes the time that their system will be down for maintenance. Since 
Windows Azure requires the use of multiple data centers for SLA remedy to apply 
it is reasonable to expect that their routine maintenance downtime will be included 
in the calculation of their uptime for SLA purpose. The uptime calculation is based 
on the billing month for each customer. It is the responsibility of the customer to 
notify Azure of their claim because of service unavailability. Azure calculates the 
service credit at 10 % for service availability below 99.95 % and at 25 % credit for 
service availability below 99 %. The service credit could be applied to the current 
billing period itself. Google Apps provides a service uptime guarantee of 99.9 %. 
It is not clear from their SLA whether they require the use of multiple data centers 
by the customers before they can claim remedy from the SLA for uptime. They 
exclude the routine maintenance downtime in calculating their service uptime. This 
is an indication that they do not require commitment to multiple data centers by the 
customers. Google Apps calculates the service uptime on a calendar month basis. 
The customer is responsible for notifying Google Apps of any service disruption 
to claim remedy. The service credit is applied by the number of days of service on 
a sliding scale. If the service uptime is less than 99.9 % then a 3-day service credit 
applies. For service uptime less than 99 %, a 7-day service credit applies. If the ser-
vice uptime falls below 95 % of the time, a 15-day service credit applies. The credit 
is applied to the current billing period. Rackspace is the only company that claims 
that they guarantee service at 100 %. A closer look at their SLA shows that the 
exclude their routine service maintenance downtimes from the uptime calculation. 
The monthly service downtime is around 1 h and so it changes the effective uptime 
from 100 to 99.86 %. The service guarantee is calculated on a billing month basis. It 
is the customer responsibility to notify of any service outage in order to claim SLA 
remedy. Rackspace uses a flat 5 % service credit for every 30 min of downtime. The 
customer is eligible up to 100 % of service credit if the service becomes unavailable 
for a total of 10 h during a billing month. The credit is applied to the current billing 
month. We summarize in Table 7.1 the various features described above in connec-
tion with the Service Level Agreement and its enforcement.
We conclude this section with one important obligation of the cloud service pro-
vider to the customer that is part of the SLA. Often the cloud customers may have 
users of their own for services that they offer. In this case the cloud customer does

not control the infrastructure but is responsible for e-discovery. This means that the 
service provider should be able to create a snapshot of all aspects of the service, 
especially communications, and store it for e-discovery. The cloud service contract 
may not specify details on e-discovery but the customer should be able to create the 
snapshot with the help of the service provider so that the authenticity of the snap-
shot is vouched by the service provider.
7.3  Sharing Log Data
Cloud service providers gather plenty of data such as user login details to a vir-
tual server, server status update, server maintenance update and operating system 
patch updates, etc. Much of this information helps the service provider to meet 
their compliance certification requirements for audit standards such as SAS 70. The 
customer will also require some of these log data to meet their compliance require-
ments. This is one aspect of log data that helps with compliance. Other uses for log

data pertain to security and real time processing of related data. From the security 
perspective the cloud customer would want access logs of all attempts to reach their 
virtual servers. This should include cloud service management access as well. From 
a customer perspective having access to this data on demand enables them to be as-
sured of their security. Technology exists today that will help gather this type of ac-
cess data. Cloud service providers should make available such data proactively and 
leave it up to the customer to process such data as they need it. This has the added 
advantage of providing system uptime statistics to the cloud customer. A third type 
of log data gathering by the cloud provider is based on certain triggers. This will 
require the ability of the log tool to work across multiple applications. For example, 
as part of video surveillance a business gathers continuous data feed from a camera 
mounted to monitor people movement. In this context the log data is gathered from 
the video stream and processed to identify individuals. Since the data stream for the 
most part consists of routine data the need arises to pick out only special events for 
further analysis. The organization may have a watch list for certain people based 
on the nature of work they do. When one such individual is recognized from the 
video stream then it would trigger a series of snapshots of data that are assembled 
in one source. In order to process such log data the preferred data format is JSON 
(JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is a light-weight data interchange format that 
can be used by machines to parse and generate data that can be read by humans 
(JSON 2014).
As part of innovative applications that are possible with cloud service, cloud pro-
viders are beginning to use log data to derive useful information. Amazon Web Ser-
vices (AWS) has introduced CloudTrail to log all API calls to AWS services. This 
log data arranged in JSON format is stored periodically in the customer’s S3 storage 
bucket. AWS is offering CloudTrail as a free service to enhance customer trust and 
to offer a tool to the cloud customers to meet their compliance requirements. Global 
standards such as ISO 27001 and PCI DSS have data logging requirements to vali-
date security practices of the implementing organizations. CloudTrail evolved from 
gathering log data for several compliance standards. Other cloud service providers 
also offer similar logs for customer manipulation. In the case of Microsoft the log 
data compiler is the Performance Monitor. The Performance Monitor can alert the 
customer when certain events occur. Google provides log monitoring using Logs 
API. The Logs API gathers all requests to apps and stores them in a log file. It is im-
portant to realize that log data will grow very rapidly. Google provides 100 MB free 
data storage for log data and charges for storage beyond that limit. This is similar 
to AWS practice where customers pay for S3 storage use and AWS stores log data 
in S3 buckets. Salesforce also facilitates gathering log data for customers through 
its debug log.
From the descriptions above it is clear that log data is available for cloud cus-
tomers to process. By its very nature this type of log data for cloud services will 
fall into the category of Big Data. In order to benefit from such log data the cloud 
customer must analyze and extract relevant information quickly. Even though the 
log data is designed to be stored for 1 year, the main use occurs close to the time 

7.3  Sharing Log Data
129
of data capture. To facilitate processing large volumes of data several application 
providers have emerged. Some of these application providers are Logentries, Sumo 
Logic, Loggly, Splunk and PaperTrail. These third party application providers have 
pre-built APIs that work with tools like CloudTrail and analyze user behavior to 
detect unusual usage patterns. These useful tools first gather large volumes of data 
from multiple system sources and reduce them to a small set for further analysis 
using Big Data Analytics toolset. These tools use pattern recognition to classify the 
data into three risk categories—high, medium and low. The system administrators 
then focus on the log data based on the risk classification.
The importance of sharing log data by the cloud service providers with the cloud 
customers is further reinforced by the positive benefits to the customers. Financial 
services companies such as large banks generate terabytes of data from several se-
curity data points daily. When such data are stored for an extended period of time 
such as 1 year, the volume of data grows to petabyte scale. The purpose of such ex-
tended storage is to infer long-term correlations. To process such large data volumes 
with low latency searches the National Security Agency (NSA) released the tool 
Accumulo through Apache open source. These developments show the government 
interest in making tools available as open source for benefiting from processing 
large volumes of log data.
The data logs originate with the cloud service provider. In a recent study Sun-
dareswaran, Squicciarini and Lin show how data on the cloud can be protected by 
timely access to log data. Their approach takes advantage of a feature of JAR (Java 
ARchives) which is connected to the file in question before it is uploaded to the 
cloud. The JAR file has the access controls specified for accessing the target file 
and it automatically logs all information about the user seeking access to the target 
file. Periodically the log data is sent to the target file owner who can verify that the 
access control mechanisms specified in the JAR file are honored. In this scenario 
the cloud service provider facilitates the functioning of the JAR file in the virtual 
machine of the cloud. The requirements are minimal, the VM needs a Java virtual 
machine installed. Thus, the user is able to benefit by the shared log data from the 
cloud (Sundareswaran 2012).
There is another form of capturing user input in the cloud, which is similar to 
log data. In this context the log data refers to data that is captured automatical-
ly based on some action by a user such as accessing an application on the cloud. 
The proposed variation in this respect also captures user data. This project from 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is called Cloud Data. The Cloud 
Data project gives a mechanism on the cloud to capture user interaction. It has the 
potential to capture trigger data based on specific actions by a user (MIT 2014). 
Another similar cloud resource is by Nimbits. This is a free application that runs 
on the cloud as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers can use Nimbits to de-
velop applications that are triggered by certain events such as a sensor data trigger 
or stock market action trigger. In this application the cloud data based on log data 
or location data triggers new events which could result in a cascading series of ac-
tions (Nimbits 2014).

7.4  Service Uptime Guarantee
Cloud services are known for their high reliability and service availability. If a cloud 
customer were to host the service in-house they will face significant challenges in 
maintaining the same level of availability. Yet, cloud customers expect a cloud ser-
vice to be available 100 % of the time. Such an expectation is unreasonable because 
technology is bound to fail sooner or later. In this section we look at service uptime 
guarantees by major cloud service providers and how well they are honored. For 
this analysis we looked at Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Google, Rack-
space, VMware, and Terremark. All these service providers guarantee a service up-
time of 99.9 %. This translates to a maximum downtime of 53 min per month. Our 
goal in this section is to highlight two things—how service providers try hard to 
provide a high level of service uptime and what factors hinder such effort.
Of the six major cloud service providers, only Terremark is backed by a telecom-
munications provider. Terremark is a division of Verizon Communications, which 
has a large communications infrastructure that they control. All other cloud service 
providers are dependent on telcos for the network part of the cloud service. Cloud 
companies invest heavily to provide reliable cloud service. The infrastructure in-
vestments by some of these companies are as follows:
AWS            $ 12 billion
Google         $ 21 billion
Microsoft     $ 18 billion
All companies have created new data centers closer to the locations of their custom-
ers to provide low-latency service. In spite of their best efforts outages are typical in 
cloud service. Over the past 5 years there have been several well publicized cloud 
outages from AWS, Google and Microsoft. Other cloud service providers are not 
immune to cloud outages. Still these companies have been able to provide a very 
high uptime for their services.
Cloud service providers realize that service uptime builds trust of their custom-
ers. Since they provide service to thousands of cloud customers they do not want to 
be held liable should their service uptime fall below their guarantee. Their primary 
reasoning for this attitude is that they are providing a commoditized service at a low 
cost. Many cloud service providers have started interpreting their service uptime 
guarantee to be measured against a whole year instead of month by month. Thus, a 
99.9 % service uptime guarantee would translate to 53 min × 12 months = 636 min 
per year. The service providers feel that given the over 10 h window per year for 
downtime is something that they could strive for in their service. Another standard 
exclusion in the uptime guarantees is the routine maintenance time, which is typi-
cally 1 h every month. Given these caveats, a 100 % uptime guarantee really trans-
lates to 99.86 % availability (Baset 2012). Based on the major outages that lasted 
anywhere from 30 h to 3 days the cloud service companies would still be liable for 
lack of service over an extended period of time. Experience shows that in many 
cases the service outages have been localized and so the service providers have tied 
their service uptime guarantee to the use of their distributed data centers. Another 

7.5  Privileged Users
131
typical exclusion for service uptime calculation is that the service downtime at any 
time lasts more than 10 min. For example, AWS service uptime guarantee applies 
only if the customer subscribes to at least two of their Availability Zones. By tying 
their service guarantee to multiple Availability Zones their focus is on making sure 
that multiple Availability Zones do not go down simultaneously.
Businesses that seek a service guarantee from cloud service providers are trying 
to protect their reputation. So the natural remedy for not meeting the service guar-
antee is some form of penalty. All cloud service providers only offer service credit 
for any violation of service guarantee. The service credits are anywhere from 5 to 
100 % of the fee paid for the service or in some cases a multiple of the service fee 
(CloudSigma 2014). In any case the financial value of such service credits to not 
offset the reputation loss for businesses and so many large businesses do not con-
cern themselves about service guarantees, instead they opt for insurance coverage 
for any service loss. At this time the cloud insurance is in its nascent stages.
In the above paragraphs we have highlighted what service uptime guarantee re-
ally means to the customer. Cloud customers automatically tie service availabil-
ity to data availability. From the customer perspective the important thing is data 
availability. This is one reason why cloud service providers are providing uptime 
guarantee only when multiple data centers are used for storage. Often data gets 
corrupted due to software bugs and accidental data deletions. So, real time disk mir-
roring would only store the erroneous data in its multiple copies. The real solution 
is to do point-in-time backups or snapshots. Cloud storage would still be reliable 
because of redundancies built-into cloud storage. It is up to the customer to create 
the snapshots and store them periodically.
Businesses want low latency in delivery of any service using the cloud. Asso-
ciated with this need is the data availability for delivery to the customer. Cloud 
service providers handle this need by using several edge servers around the globe. 
These edge servers constitute the Content Delivery Network (CDN). CDNs can 
handle static, dynamic and mobile content. Also, CDNs can deliver music, video 
and games. Cloud service providers develop CDNs so that the content is located in 
a server closest to where the customer is located. The CDN architecture replicates 
data in different edge servers based on need. In this sense the CDN supports high 
data availability even when some cloud services are down in some regions. AWS’ 
CDN offering is known as CloudFront (AWS CkoudFront 2014).
7.5  Privileged Users
Cloud service providers control the computing infrastructure. As part of the 
­management functions certain employees of the service provider will have to have 
elevated privileges. We identify such users as privileged users. The role of the privi-
leged users is to monitor that all virtual machines are functioning properly and 
the applications running on the various virtual machines stay within their allotted 
memory areas. The cloud customers are responsible for the data that they process 

7  Hidden Aspects of a Cloud Computing Contract
132
and store in the virtual machines. The privileged users monitor that the applications 
used by customers stay within their boundaries. However, since they have access 
to customer data there should be appropriate logging of all access to customer data. 
In order to build customer trust the service provider should limit the number of 
privileged users to a handful. Moreover, the service provider should identify their 
policies and practices with respect to the hiring of privileged users.
Privileged users access customer data files usually for restoration, if necessary. 
Otherwise the customer files are not looked at by privileged users. This is the norm. 
However, a rogue privileged user could have an unauthorized access to customer 
data. In such extraordinary situations the customer should be able to note such ac-
cess from an automated access control log that is read only and cannot be deleted 
by privileged users. Another way to protect content of customer data is through 
encryption, tokenization, audit and monitoring. Each of these aspects involves addi-
tional cost to the customer. Since customers are ultimately responsible for integrity 
of their data they may have third party monitors continuously monitor all database 
access to their data. This includes privileged user access. If a rogue privileged user 
deactivates the notification provision of the monitoring activity then that should 
trigger an alert to the monitoring entity. Encryption appears to be an easier solution 
because the customer can hold the encryption key and store the encrypted data in 
the cloud. However, the encrypted key will be needed to search the database and 
managing this requirement may not be easy. Tokenization is another approach in 
which authorized users will be able to obtain a secure token from the customer and 
then access the database. The idea of these approaches is to have access control to 
the data. This will be needed in case the customer has compliance requirements with 
respect to Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance.
Privileged users have unfettered access to the cloud’s physical infrastructure as 
well as the software on those servers for maintenance purposes. Because of the 
diverse nature of the work to be performed there are multiple groups of privileged 
users at the cloud provider. To protect against insider attacks on the cloud content 
Bleikertz, Kurmus, Nagy and Schunter discuss five different areas to focus on. We 
summarize this work to show how cloud customers should be aware of possible 
insider attacks on their data. The potential for malicious behavior arises during 
maintenance when many manual processes are involved, including replacement of 
the hardware. For this reason the cloud management practice should include separa-
tion of duties among the various groups of privileged users. The three main groups 
involved are the hardware team, the security team and the remote maintenance per-
sonnel. Organizational policies and access control to physical infrastructure provide 
audit trail for the first two groups of users. For the group of remote maintainers 
the principle of least privileges should be the norm (Bleikertz 2012). As the need 
arises for higher privileges these administrators can elevate their privileges, which 
are automatically recorded in a store-only device. This storage content should be 
­accessible to customer initiated audits.
Focusing further on the privileged users and the possibility of insider attacks dur-
ing routine maintenance, any modifications to the system content should be ­visible 

7.5  Privileged Users
133
to the security team. To prevent insider modification of customer data resulting in 
loss of integrity, the security team should be able to roll back the modifications. 
The security policy of the cloud service provider should move a physical hardware 
from trusted to untrusted mode until it is verified by the security team and moved 
into the trusted mode. This security procedure should be communicated to the cloud 
customers to enhance customer trust. Figure 7.1 illustrates this process. The nature 
of maintenance requires the privileged users to be able to view the access logs. 
However, in order to maintain data confidentiality the privileged user should not be 
able to access the customer data unless authorized by the customer. The reason for 
such a need is that certain problems connected with corrupted data is unverifiable 
to identify the cause in a test VM or the problem disappears when the VM is turned 
off. This is an indication that some malicious code has infected the customer appli-
cation and is embedded. In order to detect and remove such malicious code the VM 
must be running and the privileged user should be able to access the VM during run 
time. Thus there are instances when privileged users may access customer data with 
the knowledge of the customer.
As an enhancement of this process it is possible to monitor privileged user ac-
cess to customer VMs in light of the process described in Fig. 7.1. In this approach 
the privileged user access to customer VMs is layered. In Layer 1, the privileged 
user has no access to customer VM but can maintain the physical infrastructure 
in which the VM resides. In Layer 2, the privileged user has Read Only access to 
customer VM for checking the maintenance logs. In Layer 3, the privileged user 
is granted “White-Listed Write Access” to customer VM implying that all non-
sensitive system files can be modified, such as applying routine patches. In Layer 
4, the privileged user access is at the “Black-Listed Write Access” level meaning 
that any write at this level should place the VM in an unsecure state. As mentioned 
in Fig. 7.1 the VM has to be reviewed by the security team and placed in the Post-
maintenance trusted state. Black-Listed write access would include changes to the

operating ­system and addition of new software. Finally, in Layer 5 the privileged 
user is granted full access to the customer VM and it should automatically place the 
customer VM in untrusted mode until verified and approved by the security team 
(Bleikertz 2012).
7.6  Data Portability
Cloud service growth is exponential. There are less than 50 large global cloud ser-
vice providers whereas there are several hundred smaller cloud service providers 
who use Infrastructure as a Service feature from these large cloud service providers 
and offer cloud service of their own. By design the large service providers encour-
age such use of their cloud service. When so many cloud service providers are in the 
marketplace, it is inevitable that some will go out of business or the cloud customer 
may want to move their service to another cloud service provider. In either case 
the customer data needs to be moved from one provider to another within a limited 
period of time. Support for this feature in cloud service is called data portability. At 
this time there are no global standards to support data portability, which essentially 
supports the ability of cloud customer to change the service provider easily. Since 
the cloud computing industry is still maturing it will take some more years before 
the customers can expect the same level of mobility that they enjoy with telecom 
services. In a broader sense data portability includes moving data between applica-
tions within the same provider. Since more and more organizations use cloud to 
store data the need for data portability has evolved to be an important component of 
cloud service. However, the cloud service providers have not developed a standard 
process for facilitating data portability. One reason for this is the lack of cloud stan-
dards that gives the cloud service provider the freedom to use their own proprietary 
format to store data in the cloud. The APIs that the cloud service provider supports 
facilitate the use of popular applications such as Outlook email, Office 365 and 
CRM applications from Salesforce. The data portability involves having a process 
to move such data from one service provider to another and be able to use the same 
applications. This aspect of cloud service is still evolving due to lack of global 
standards. However, the Open Stack, Cloud Security Alliance, IEEE and similar 
consortium efforts are steps in the right direction for data portability (IEEE 2014; 
Cloud Security Alliance 2014).
Data portability related problems are multi-faceted. The most expected data 
portability aspect relates to the ability of the customer to switch providers and 
have their data transferred to the new provider quickly. A recent European Union 
Parliament resolution calls for “complete data and service portability, and a high 
degree of interoperability between cloud services, in order to increase rather than 
limit competitiveness” (EU 2013). Thus, the importance of data portability aids 
not only the customer but also increases competitiveness. Data portability also 
means the ability to have access to data between multiple applications based on 
central cloud storage. This means that a social media application would need ac-

7.6  Data Portability
135
cess to contact information for friends from an email system. Another aspect of 
data portability involves data integration. All users want data integrity and so a 
data updated in one system should automatically make available the updates to 
other systems that have used the data in the past. At present there are several un-
knowns with data portability. When a cloud customer decides to port data then 
the cloud provider should make known in what standard format that data will 
be ported, how long will the data be available for porting, at what data rate and 
bandwidth the customer can expect to port the data? The question of cost of data 
porting should also be specified in an upfront contract rather than at the time of 
data porting. Often the cloud service providers in their standard contract include 
a “data hostage” clause which means that the data will be released only upon all 
payments due the provider. This is not disputed when the porting takes place at the 
end of a contract. However, when the customer terminates the contract for cause 
in their opinion, then the cloud provider may not agree and want an early termina-
tion penalty paid, which would be significant. Since access to timely data is criti-
cal for businesses this matter could not be left up to litigation. The cloud provider 
and customer should agree to provisions at the initiation of contract as to how data 
portability will be handled upon contract termination.
Data portability is well supported at the device level among multiple applica-
tions. For example, a user using an email application on a Tablet PC later on has the 
ability to seamlessly access emails on a mobile device and download attachments. 
This is data portability. However, the cloud service providers have not matured to 
the level of application support for multiple devices for data portability. Ordinary 
consumers are able to integrate their data such as contacts, photos, videos and per-
sonal information from multiple social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter 
and LinkeIn and use the information on all devices accessing these applications. 
This data integration capability helps the consumer keep their data portable and 
maintain its integrity. The social network Facebook allows the users to download 
their data for backup and offline processing. This helps with data loss prevention. 
The users can also upload the data to their account for ease of content change. 
Moreover, the consumer with accounts in Facebook and Gmail will be able to share 
their contacts across these two different applications easily. The advances in data 
portability with such individual applications show its importance for customers. 
Cloud computing, by supporting data portability, can significantly increase the val-
ue of cloud service to the customers.
Among cloud services data portability takes on a significant challenge at present. 
Based on the literature on this topic we recommend the following best practices for 
data portability. Cloud providers typically include a “data hostage” clause in their 
contracts to mean that the customer data will not be returned to the customer until 
the customer pays for all services rendered or pays the contract termination fee. 
Disputes arise based on the reason for contract termination. Any delay in customer 
having access to their data is detrimental to their business and so the usual legal pro-
cess will not meet customer expectations on data availability for porting to another 
service provider or back in-house. Two possible solutions exist. Federal legislation 
could force the cloud service provider to return customer data immediately and then 

7  Hidden Aspects of a Cloud Computing Contract
136
pursue their legal claim against the cloud customer. Another option is for the two 
parties to agree at the outset of the service initiation that an independent arbitrator 
would rule on the validity of customer claim to data without breach of contract. By 
design the independent arbitrator decision should be quick in order for the customer 
to have access to their data for porting elsewhere. There is no federal legislation in 
the offing and so the arbitrator route is the preferred route for data portability at this 
time.
For businesses of all sizes their data is the most precious commodity. Business-
es need continuous access to their data. Given the possibility of cloud customers 
switching service from one provider to another there should be a global standard 
for data portability. There is precedence to learn from the telecommunications in-
dustry in supporting customer migration to new service providers. The difficulty 
in developing a global standard for data portability stems from the fact that too 
many different types of data are stored—textual data based on applications such 
as wordprocessing and spreadsheet, audio data such as music, video data. Each of 
these data exist in multiple formats. In order to support data portability there should 
be a global standard similar to ISO 27001. There are organizations such as Cloud 
Security Alliance, Cloud Industry Forum, and Open Data Center Alliance that are 
developing industry standards for data portability. Since these organizations consist 
of all the leading global cloud service providers any data portability standard devel-
oped by these consortium efforts will lead to a global standard.
Data portability also has an economic impact aspect associated with it. The World 
Economic Forum in its 2011 report points out, “facilitating system interoperability, 
enabling users to customize their own cloud solutions across multiple providers, 
and data portability to ease user fears of vendor lock-in and government fears about 
lack of competition” are important considerations in the use of cloud computing 
(World Economic Forum 2011). In order to realize the significant economic impact 
of 2.3 million new jobs in the top 5 EU economies due to cloud computing and a 
$ 55 billion revenue globally from public cloud alone, the cloud computing industry 
has to focus on data portability. Realizing the importance of data portability and 
interoperability the Open Group, a global consortium of service providers aiming 
towards common IT standards, has created a report that addresses data portability. 
The main idea of data portability is the reuse of data components across multiple 
applications. For example, a business using a Customer Relations Management 
(CRM) application on the cloud may find that the CRM terms of offering are no 
longer attractive. In that case it might want to port the data back in-house in order 
to use a local CRM application (Open Group 2013). It is such scenarios that support 
the widespread adoption of cloud services. The Open Group’s approach is to de-
velop standards for data portability that is accepted by the providers and customers. 
The data portability needs scenario is highly likely because a cloud service provider 
offering SaaS would switch to a newer version of the product more easily than an 
individual customer would consider. This could necessitate some changes for the 
customer in the form of modifying their data for access by the new application. That 
is when the customer might want to use a different service and port the data out of 
the service provider.

7.7  Summary
Cloud service customers benefit from cloud services. Cloud customers depend on 
their contract for the guaranteed level of service. Since cloud services generally tend 
to use their standard contract available online and executed via the click-through 
feature, cloud customers do not feel that they have adequate protection afforded 
by the contract. In this chapter we looked at the hidden aspects of a cloud contract. 
This analysis showed that customers prefer a customized Service Level Agreement 
(SLA) whereas the service providers prefer their standard contract. The main con-
clusion is that the SLAs generally favor the service provider. Since the contract 
refers to a web content managed by the service provider, the details are changed pe-
riodically without much recourse for the customer. The analysis of cloud contracts 
led to the discussion on the importance of sharing log data with the customers so 
that they would be able to meet their compliance obligations. The cloud customer 
concern is usually with respect to security and service availability. It was pointed 
out that all major cloud service providers offer a 99.9 % service uptime guarantee 
but try to qualify this guarantee in the form of various exclusions. Even though this 
level of uptime is quite significant, given the total reliance of thousands of custom-
ers worldwide on cloud services, any small outage in service leads to disruption 
for a very large number of businesses. On the security side, cloud customers are 
concerned about the access to customer data by the privileged users at the service 
provider. In this discussion we pointed out the alternatives available that would en-
hance customer trust based on the level of privileged access users have to their data. 
The chapter concludes with a detailed analysis of the importance of data portability 
for customers and how governments and standards bodies are trying to come up 
with new laws and standards supporting data portability. Since cloud computing is 
still maturing as a service it will take some more time before global standards are in 
place that will support full customer mobility within various cloud services, just like 
people around the world enjoy mobility in telecommunications service.
