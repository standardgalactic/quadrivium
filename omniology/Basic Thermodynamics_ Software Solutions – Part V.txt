gas mixtures
Learning objectives:
1.	 ‚ÄòIdeal gas‚Äô, ‚ÄòPerfect gas‚Äô, ‚ÄòSemi-perfect gases‚Äô and ‚ÄòReal gas‚Äô are defined.
2.	 Various equations of state for Ideal as well as real gases are presented.
3.	 Next, ‚Äòcompressibility factor‚Äô and ‚Äòprinciple of corresponding states‚Äô are discussed.
4.	 Topics of Internal energy, Enthalpy and Specific heats for Ideal gases are reviewed.
5.	 Next, properties of mixtures of ideal gases are dealt with.
6.	 Dalton‚Äôs Law, Gibbs-Dalton Law, Avogadro‚Äôs Law etc are stated. Procedures to calculate sp. 
heats, apparent Molecular weight, Gas constant, internal energy, enthalpy etc of a mixture of 
ideal gases is explained.
7.	 Above topics are illustrated by solving several problems.
9.1	
Introduction:
In this chapter, we shall study the concept of ‚ÄòIdeal gas‚Äô, ‚ÄòPerfect gas‚Äô and ‚ÄòReal gases‚Äô. We shall deal 
with property diagrams and various equations of state. We shall also explain about the principle of 
corresponding states and the generalized compressibility chart in connection with the real gases. 
Calculation of specific heats at constant volume and constant pressure for gases will be enumerated next.
9.2	
Ideal, Perfect and Real Gases:
For an Ideal gas:
‚Ä¢ Molecule is treated as a ‚Äòpoint mass‚Äô
‚Ä¢ It is assumed that gas molecules occupy negligible volume
‚Ä¢ No molecular attraction
‚Ä¢ Molecular collisions are elastic
‚Ä¢ Follows the law: P.v = R.T, where P = pressure (Pa), v = sp. volume (m3/kg), 
T = temperature (K), and R = gas constant for that particular gas (J/kg.K)
‚Ä¢ Specific heats are functions of temperature
For a Perfect gas:
‚Ä¢ All the assumptions are the same, except that the specific heats are constants and do not 
vary with temperature

In reality, there is no ideal or perfect gas. H2, O2, N2, He etc behave nearly as perfect gases and are 
known as ‚Äòsemi perfect gases‚Äô.
For a Realgas:
‚Ä¢ Molecular volumes and intermolecular attraction will be considered.
‚Ä¢ Several equations of state have been proposed

Deviation from Ideal gas behavior ‚Äì Compressibility factor:
While the Ideal gas equation is very simple to use, it must be noted that it is mostly applicable for gases 
at low densities, i.e. at low pressures and high temperatures. Gases deviate considerably from ideal gas 
behavior at regions near the critical point and saturation lines. This is shown below:
Fig. 9.2 Deviation from Ideal gas law [7]
Departure from Ideal gas behavior against pressure for some gases is illustrated below:
Fig. 9.3 Deviation from Ideal gas law for some gases [9]
For the specific case of Water/Steam, following graph illustrates the regions where Ideal gas law can 
be applied without much error. Note that around the critical point, the error is unacceptably high i.e. 
about 330%.

RRea l a nd ideal  gase s and  ga s mixture
In problem solving, generally, we use the Lee-Kesler compressibility chart, based on ideal fluid assumption:
Fig. 9.6 Lee-Kesler compressibility chart [8]
We note the following from the generalized compressibility chart:
(i) At very low pressures, i.e. at PR << 1, gases behave like an ideal gas irrespective of temperature
(ii) At high temperatures, i.e. at TR > 2, ideal gas behavior can be assumed irrespective of pressure, except 
at very high pressures of PR >> 1
(iii) Deviation from ideal gas behavior is most pronounced in the region near the critical point.

Equations of state for ‚ÄòReal gases‚Äô:
Several equations of state have been proposed in an attempt to predict P-V-T behavior of substances 
over a wider range of pressures and temperatures. We shall present a few of them below:
9.6.1	
Van der Waal‚Äôs equation of state:
This is one of the earliest attempts (1873) to increase the range of applicability of ideal gas equation by 
inserting factors to take into account the intermolecular attractions and the finite volume occupied by 
the molecules in a real gas. It is of the following form:
P
a
v2
v
b
(
)

R T

......(4.10)
Here, the term (a/v2) accounts for the intermolecular attraction and the term b accounts for the volume 
occupied by the molecules. The constants a and b are given in terms of critical properties as follows:
a
27 R2

T cr

64 P cr

and
b
R T cr

8 P cr

........(4.11)
To express Van der Waals equation in terms of mole basis, replace v by vbar and R by Ru in the 
above equations.
a and b can thus be calculated from the critical properties of a given gas.
Values of a and b for some common fluids are given below [17]

Benedict‚ÄìWebb‚ÄìRubin (BWR) equation of state (1940):
In this equation number of constants is raised to 8. BWR equation is of following form:
Constants in eqn. (4.13) are given in the following Table:
Table 9.5 Values of constants in BWR equation [7]
Here, note that P is in kPa, 
 is in m3/kmol, T is in K and Ru is 8.314 (kPa-m3)/(kmol-K).
BWR equation is accurate at densities up to 2.5 times the density at the critical point.
In 1962, Strobridge improved this equation further by raising the number of constants to 16. It is therefore, 
more suitable for computer analysis.

Here, R is the Universal gas constant = 8.314472 J/mol.K. Vm is the molar volume, i.e. volume of 1 mole 
of liquid or gas; Pc is the pressure at the critical point; Vc is the molar volume at the critical point. R-K 
equation performs poorly for liquid phase. It is suitable for gas phase calculation when PR < (TR/2).

Peng-Robinson equation of state (1976) [5]: 
This equation is most widely used in chemical engineering thermodynamics. It gives better prediction 
of liquid states as compared to other equations of state. This equation of state requires three inputs per 
compound: Tc, Pc and the acentric factor œâ. This equation has the following form:
where
and,
 
Also, Universal gas constant R = 8.314472 J/mol.K. Vm is the molar volume, i.e. volume of 1 mole of 
liquid or gas; Pc is the pressure at the critical point; Vc is the molar volume at the critical point.
The Peng-Robinson equation is particularly useful for all calculations of all fluid properties in Natural gas 
processes. Further, this equation has reasonable accuracy near the critical point; therefore, it is suitable 
to calculate the compressibility factors and liquid density.

Virial equation of state [5]: 
All the above equations of state depend on measured properties of fluids. But, the virial equation of state 
is derived directly from statistical mechanics. It is of following form:
And,
Here, R is the Universal gas constant = 8.314472 J/mol.K. Vm is the molar volume, i.e. volume of 1 mole of 
liquid or gas; Pc is the pressure at the critical point; Vc is the molar volume at the critical point. Accuracy 
can be increased by increasing the number of terms in eqn. (4.22).

Internal energy (u) and enthalpy (h) of an Ideal gas:
Joule‚Äôs Law: ‚ÄúSpecific internal energy of a gas is a function of temp only and is independent of both 
pressure and volume‚Äù
i.e. u = f(T) only.
And, for enthalpy:
h = u + P * v = u + R * T

Properties of Mixtures of Ideal gases [18]:
9.10.1	
Dalton‚Äôs Law: 
The pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the constituents.
The partial pressure of each constituent is that pressure which the gas would exert if it occupied alone 
that volume occupied by the mixture at the same temperature.
Considering a mixture of two Ideal gases A and B:
Or,
m = Œ£ mi 
and,
p = Œ£ pi 
9.10.2	
Gibbs-Dalton Law:
The internal energy, enthalpy and entropy of a gaseous mixture are respectively equal to the sums of the 
internal energies, enthalpies and entropies of the constituents.
Each constituent has that internal energy, enthalpy and entropy which it could have if it occupied alone 
that volume occupied by the mixture at the temperature of the mixture.

RRea l a nd ideal  gase s and  ga s mixture
9.10.3	
Volumetric analysis of a gas mixture:
Consider a volume V of a gaseous mixture at a temp T consisting of three constituents A, B and C. Let 
each of the constituents be compressed to the total pressure p of the mixture and let the temp remain 
constant. The partial volumes occupied by the constituents will then be VA, VB and VC.
And, we get:
i.e. Œ£ Vi = Œ£ (pi * V) / p = (V / P) * Œ£ pi
But, p = Œ£ pi
Therefore: Œ£ Vi = V
Thus, ‚Äúvolume of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the volumes of the individual constituents 
when each exists alone at the pressure and temp of mixture.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ This is known as Amagat‚Äôs Law.
Remember:
n = m / M where 
n is the no. of moles, m = mass of gas, and M = molecular weight of gas
Avogadro‚Äôs Law: ‚Äúnumber of moles of any gas is proportional to the volume of the gas at a given 
pressure and temperature‚Äù.
So, total number of moles in a vessel containing a mixture of gases must equal the sum of the moles 
of the individual constituents. 
i.e.
i.e. n = Œ£ ni

Apparent Molecular weight and Gas constant:
If a gas mixture, with total number of moles n, occupies a total volume of V, at a temperature T, then:
p * V = Ru * T * Œ£ ni 
i.e. p * V = n * Ru * T where Ru is the Universal gas const.
Apparent mol. weight is defined as: M = m / n
where, m = the mass of the mixture, and n = no. of moles in the mixture
Apparent Gas constant for the mixture is defined as R = Ru / M
It can be assumed that the mixture of perfect gases behaves like a perfect gas and obeys the perfect gas laws.
Apparent gas constant of mixture in terms of individual gas constants:
R = Œ£ (mi / m)*Ri
where (mi / m) = mass fraction of constituent i
Also note that:
i.e. Molar analysis is identical with the volumetric analysis, and both are equal to the ratio of partial 
pressure to the total pressure.
Also:
M = Œ£ (ni / n) .Mi
And,
M = 1 / Œ£ (mfi / Mi) 
where mfi is the mass fraction of species i, Mi is its mol. wt.

Mixing of two Ideal gases at same P and T [Ref: 2]:
Let a mass mA of ideal gas A at a given P and T be mixed with mB of ideal gas B at the same P and T, 
such that the final ideal gas mixture is also at P and T. Then, entropy change for the process is:
Note that increase in entropy depends only on the no. of moles of component gases and is independent 
of the composition of the gas.

‚ÄúProb. 9.15. An ideal gas cycle consisting of 3 processes uses Argon (M = 40) as working substance. 
Process 1-2 is a reversible adiabatic process from 0.014 m^3, 700 kPa and 280 C to 0.056 m^3. Process 
2-3 is a reversible isothermal process. Process 3-1 is an isobaric process. Sketch the cycle on P-v and 
T-s diagrams, and find: (i) the work transfer in process 1-2, (ii) work transfer in process 2-3, (iii) net 
work output from the cycle (assume gamma = 1.67), and (iv) change in enthalpy for each process.

Problems solved with TEST:
Prob.9.27. An ideal gas cycle consisting of 3 processes uses Argon (M = 40) as working substance. 
Process 1-2 is a reversible adiabatic process from 0.014 m^3, 700 kPa and 280 C to 0.056 m^3. 
Process 2-3 is a reversible isothermal process. Process 3-1 is an isobaric process. Sketch the cycle on P-v 
and T-s diagrams, and find: (i) the work transfer in process 1-2, (ii) work transfer in process 2-3, (iii) 
net work output from the cycle (assume gamma = 1.67), and (iv) change in enthalpy for each process.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

3.	 Select O2 for Gas-A and N2 for Gas-B. For State1, enter values of p1, T1, and mass fraction 
of O2 = x_A1 = 0.23 and hit Enter. Immediately, mole fraction y_A1 for O2, Gas const. for 
mixture (i.e. R1) and Mol. wt. for the mixture, MM1 are calculated. 
We see from the above screen shot that:
Mole fraction of O2 = y_A1 = 0.20721 = 20.72% ‚Ä¶ Ans.
Therefore, mole fraction of N2 = 1 ‚Äì 0.20721 = 0.79279 = 79.28%

Then, mass fraction of O2 = 1 ‚Äì 0.11191 = 0.88809
Therefore, for 1 kg of O2: 
Mass of mixture = 1/0.88809 = 1.126 kg.
And, Mass of H2 = 1.126 ‚Äì 1 = 0.126 kg ‚Ä¶. Ans.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

3.	 Now, form the mixture: To do this, follow Instructions given in the blue window:
i.e. to form the mixture, go down to the lower blue window, and select the gas from the widget, enter 
its % by mass or volume etc. as shown and click on Add/Modify. Then that gas gets entered in the blue 
window below. Do this for each component, and also enter for State 1 (in the State panel) values for 
p1, T1 and m1. Then, click on Calculate. Many properties of the mixture are calculated immediately: 
Note from the above that Mixture vol. = 1.32851 m^3, Mixture Mol. wt. = 18.15803 kg/kmol, Mixture 
cp = 2.14139 kJ/kg.K.
4.	 For State 2, enter p2, m2 = m1, and s2 = s1 (since rev. adiabatic process is an isentropic 
process), m2 = m1. Hit Enter:
We see from the above that properties in State 2 are calculated.

EES Function to find out the compressibility Factor, Z when Tr and Pr are given:
Recall that we have the compressibility factor chart as shown below:
Now, in computer calculations, it is not very convenient to refer to the above graph as and when required. 
Also, interpolation in this graph is difficult because the x-axis is in logarithmic scale.
Therefore, it is preferable to have an EES Function to calculate Z when Tr and Pr are given. It makes the 
calculations very easy and simple.
To write the EES Function, following are the steps:
1.	 Digitize each curve in the above plot using the ‚Äòfree‚Äô software  ‚ÄúPlot Digitizer‚Äù available from 
http://plotdigitizer.sourceforge.net. It is a Java based program, which is very easy to use.
2.	 Copy the x-y data produced in PlotDigitizer to EXCEL.
3.	 Use EES to re-cast the data such that x-axis (i.e. Pr) values are common for all the curves i.e. 
for Tr = 5, 2, 1.5, ‚Ä¶..0.8, by linear interpolation.

4.	 Set up the final Table in EXCEL as shown below. Table is shown only partially, to conserve space.

5.	 Now, copy this Table as a Lookup Table in to EES and name it as ‚ÄòCompressibilityFactor‚Äô.
6.	 Now, this Table is in a format suitable for 2D interpolation in EES, i.e. top horizontal row 
gives Tr values: 5 , 2, 1.5 ‚Ä¶. 0.8, and left vertical column gives Pr values: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 
‚Ä¶..10. Rest of the numbers in the Table are corresponding Z values.
7.	  Z value for given Tr and Pr is found out by 2D interpolation in EES using the built-in 
Function interpolate2DM.
8.	 The simple EES Function to find Z when Tr and Pr are given is now written:

$UnitSystem SI Pa C J
FUNCTION Compressibility_Factor_Z(Tr,Pr)
{ Compressibility_Factor_Z  ‚Ä¶ finds the compressibility factor, given Tr (=T/Tc) and Pr (=P/Pc)}
Compressibility_Factor_Z = Interpolate2DM(‚ÄòCompressibilityFactor‚Äô,Tr,Pr)

Use of the above Function is demonstrated with the following example:
Example: Calculate the density of Nitrogen at 260 bar and 15 C using the compressibility chart.
Following is the EES program:
