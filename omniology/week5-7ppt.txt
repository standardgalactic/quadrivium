Reflex Loop Regulates Breathing  

Chemoreceptors  
Peripheral  
   carotid receptors and aortic bodies 
   stimulated by: decrease in PaO2 (hypoxia) 
 
increase in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis) 
 
decrease in pH within the arterial blood (metabolic 
 
acidosis) 
 
Central 
  throughout the brain stem 
  sense H+ but influenced by arterial PCO2 since CO2 but 
 
not H+ crosses blood-brain barrier 

Inspiratory Receptors of the Lung 
 
1. Pulmonary stretch receptors located in the smooth muscle of the 
large and small airways of the lung are mechanoreceptors that fire with the 
inflation of the lung.  These receptors stop inspiration as part of the Hering-
Breuer reflex. In the adult this reflex is evoked only under conditions of 
large tidal volumes as in rigorous exercise.  
 
 
2. J Receptors located in the walls of the pulmonary capillaries which 
are stimulated by pulmonary vascular congestion, edema, air emboli (air in 
the blood), and low lung volumes. Stimulation of these receptors can result 
in rapid breathing (hyperpnea), and or labored breathing (dyspnea). 
 
3. Pulmonary irritant receptors located in airway epithelium and the 
nasal mucosa. Mechanical or chemical irritation elicits a cough reflex and 
bronchoconstriction.

Key Concepts 
Respiratory acidosis and alkalosis result from 
increases and decreases, respectively in PaCO2 
levels. Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are 
conditions in which changes in PaCO2 are not the 
primary cause for changes in pH.  
 
At rest, arterial PCO2 is the most important 
determinant in the ventilatory drive.  
 
The central chemoreceptors detect changes in 
arterial PCO2 by sensing H+ concentration in 
interstitial tissue. Peripheral chemoreceptors 
(carotid bodies) sense changes in arterial PO2, PCO2, 
and H+ levels (pH). Low plasma pH always increases 
minute ventilation.
