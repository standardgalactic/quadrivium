Preface 
The ﬁrst edition of this book arose out of a desire to better understand the foun-
dations of loop quantum gravity, at a time when I and my co-author Deepak Vaid 
were both postdocs. We were essentially exploring a realm of knowledge that was 
comparatively new to both of us. Although the broad outline of this realm was evi-
dent, a cohesive picture of its structure appeared to be hidden behind a substantial 
mathematical paraphernalia. It wasn’t always clear how much of this was necessary 
to grasp the physical underpinnings of the theory. Towards the goal of improving 
our own understanding we conceived of and composed a review article in the 
hopes that by clearing our own bewilderment about topics such as holonomies and 
spin networks, we might also contribute to mapping out these concepts and the 
relationships between them for others interested in this rapidly developing ﬁeld. It 
was a happy surprise when we were invited to turn that review article into a book, 
which became the ﬁrst edition of this text. As our efforts were geared towards 
understanding the basic structure of loop quantum gravity (LQG) and connecting 
it to more familiar branches of modern physics, there were many important topics 
that we left out of the ﬁrst edition. Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, we chose to omit 
any meaningful discussion of the covariant 3 plus 1 formalism of spacetime dynamics 
which goes by the name of spin foams. 
It was therefore another happy surprise when the ﬁrst edition was sufﬁciently 
well-received that our publishers invited us to produce an updated second edition, 
affording the opportunity to include a more thorough discussion of the topics we 
had skipped the ﬁrst time around. Unfortunately owing to other concerns and per-
sonal priorities, Deepak concluded that he was unable to contribute the time and 
effort needed to bring the second edition to completion. We discussed what role (if 
any) he wanted to have, and eventually he made the difﬁcult decision to withdraw 
from co-authorship of the second edition. I wish to make it clear, however, that 
the work he put into the ﬁrst edition was inestimable, and without it the current 
edition would not exist. Furthermore the content of the updates included in this 
edition was largely inspired by his enthusiasm for these topics, and much of the 
discussion of group ﬁeld theory was based upon rough notes that he shared with 
me. He also kindly volunteered to proof-read the draft of the second edition. Those 
sections which have not been substantially updated from the ﬁrst edition still refer 
to the authors, plural, as they were a joint effort. It is important and fair to ensure
v

Preface
that Deepak’s contributions are fully recognised. Naturally, any errors or ﬂaws in 
the second edition are my responsibility alone. 
And so, after several years and the devotion of much time and effort towards 
deeper understanding of the topics at hand, it is a pleasure to present the second 
edition of this work. This book is not intended to be an account of the current 
state of the art, as research is always developing but books are static and rapidly 
fall out-of-date. So while extra material has been included in this edition, the 
focus has been on broadening the range of foundational concepts covered and 
emphasising the conceptual links between topics. It is my sincere hope that much 
as the ﬁrst edition was successful (at least in its creators’ opinion) in providing a 
pedagogical introduction to the foundations of LQG, the second edition will help 
clarify the central concepts and technical tools of spin foams, group ﬁeld theory, 
spinorial LQG, and coherent states for the reader bewildered and discouraged by 
the vast literature on these topics and the accompanying mathematical tools which 
appear to be necessary for these constructions, as well as covering some earlier 
developments to show where the state of the art comes from. 
The opportunity has also been taken to make some minor but desirable amend-
ments, to reﬂect the intended role of this book as an introduction for interested 
outsiders from a wide range of backgrounds. These have included a more thor-
ough discussion of the connection between entropy and information theory, a 
more detailed discussion of the group theory describing special relativity, a more 
extensive discussion of differential forms to bridge the gap between indexed and 
index-free notation, as well as a number of adjustments to wording in several 
instances, additional discussions to enhance the reader’s intuition for the meaning 
behind the maths, and updated illustrations more suitable for viewing in e-book 
format. Furthermore, the choice of notation has been reworked to ensure the use 
of symbols and indices is more consistent throughout the text. There is of course 
much more that could have been included, but I hope the right balance has been 
struck between the breadth and depth of the content. 
Whether or not this book is successful in the goal Deepak and I initially set 
ourselves for this edition will be determined by its readers. If ever the possibility 
of a third edition is raised, I will take that as a sign that this work did indeed help 
some in the community enhance their understanding of this important approach 
towards a theory of quantum gravity. 
I wish again to thank Deepak Vaid for his work on the ﬁrst edition, as well as 
his contribution of ideas and feedback on drafts of this edition. I also wish to thank 
Christian Caron, Chandra Sekaran Arjunan, Lisa Scalone, and Sivananth Sivachan-
dran at Springer for their substantial patience and guidance during the preparation 
of the manuscript. During the writing of this book, I have been employed in teach-
ing and research positions at the University of Adelaide and RMIT University and 
was supported in part by the Australian Research Council through a Discovery 
Project (project number DP200102152). I wish to thank Nicolas Menicucci for 
his support, discussions, and suggestions, and Valentina Baccetti for her support 
through the RMIT Vice-Chancellor’s Research Fellowship. I also wish to thank 
Gavin Brennen of Macquarie University for discussions and suggestions, Sebastian

Conventions 
Before we proceed, a quick description of our conventions will hopefully be useful 
to the reader. We have attempted to strike a balance between clarity of description 
and simplicity of notation. In particular, the use of different symbols for indices 
should clearly indicate the number of dimensions, and whether we are dealing with 
tensors, matrices, Lie algebra generators, etc. Deviations from these conventions 
may occur from time to time, in the effort to avoid confusion through the re-use of 
similar symbols. However, every effort has been made to avoid assigning different 
meanings to the same symbol within individual chapters; 
Indices 
• Greek letters mu com ma nu c om ma r ho com ma period period period element of StartSet 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSet from the middle of the alphabet are 
four-dimensional spacetime indices. Other Greek letters, alp ha  c o mma beta comma ellipsis will be used 
for general cases in upper N dimensions, and when unused indices are needed to 
complete tensor expressions. 
• Lowercase letters a c om a b  c omma c comma ellipsis from the start of the Latin alphabet are integers, 
primarily used as three-dimensional spatial indices, taking values in Star tSe t 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSet. 
These will often be used when dealing exclusively with the spatial part of 
a four-dimensional quantity that would otherwise have Greek indices. More 
generally, they may be used as integer parameters. 
• Lowercase letters i c omma  j  c o mma k com ma ellip sis element of 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma period period period comma upper N from the middle of the Latin alpha-
bet are indices for a space of upper N dimensions. Equations involving these indices 
are the general cases, which can be applied to Minkowski space, double struck upper R cubed, etc. They 
will also sometimes be used as indices labelling rows and columns of matrices, 
and as German s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis Lie algebra indices. 
• Uppercase letters uppe r I com m a  upper J comma upper K comma ellipsis are speciﬁcally “internal” indices used for Lie 
algebra elements, which take values in the appropriate range, such as Star tSe t 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSet
for the Pauli matrices, or Star tSe t 0  comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetfor the German  s l left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesis Lorentz Lie algebra.

Symbols 
Wherever possible, to avoid ambiguity we will refrain from using “special” letters 
as indices, or distinguish particular symbols from their index versions to avoid 
confusion, as follows; 
• The Greek lower-case lamdarefers to paths, and is not used as an index. 
• The imaginary unit will be in boldface, hence bo ld i equals StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot√bold i equals StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot, to distinguish it from 
the index i. 
• Similarly, the bold b o l d s y m b o l j will be used to denote spin, when necessary, to distinguish 
it from an index. 
• The cosmological scale factor will be denoted in bold, hence b o l d s y m b o l a, to distinguish 
it from an index. We follow the standard practice of using a for lattice spacing, 
and a c om a b comma c for the sides of a triangle; however, it should be clear from context 
when these are not indices. 
• The Greek lower-case gammawithout indices occurs as an index in the early chap-
ters, but from Chap. 5 onwards it is used exclusively for the Barbero-Immirzi 
parameter. With indices (e.g. gamma Superscript mu or gamma Subscript upper I), it always denotes the Dirac gamma 
matrices. 
• Annihilation and creation operators are denoted by Modi fyingAbove a With caret comma ModifyingAbove b With caret (and their conjugates), 
rather than a c omma b. 
• For blades and forms (see Appendix B), the letters u co m ma v comma wrepresent k-blades, 
and an arrow above a symbol (e.g. ModifyingAbove u With right arrow, ModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow ) denotes a vector, in any number of 
dimensions. Differential forms will be represented either by alp ha comma beta or Roman 
capitals as noted in the text. 
• The gravitational constant is denoted by the symbol script upper G, rather than upper G.

Introduction 
1.1
Motivation and Some History 
The goal of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is to take two extremely well-developed 
and successful theories, General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT), 
at “face value” and attempt to combine them into a single theory with a minimum 
of assumptions and deviations from established physics. Our goal, as authors of 
this book, is to provide a succinct but clear description of LQG—the main body 
of concepts in the current formulation of LQG relying primarily on the self-dual 
variables approach, some of the historical basis underlying these concepts, and a 
few simple yet interesting results—aimed at the reader who has more curiosity than 
familiarity with the underlying concepts, and hence desires a broad, pedagogical 
overview before attempting to read more technical discussions. This book is inspired 
by the view that one never truly understands a subject until one tries to explain it to 
others. Accordingly we have attempted to create a discussion which we would have 
wanted to read when ﬁrst encountering LQG. Everyone’s learning style is different, 
and accordingly we make note of several other reviews of this subject [ 1– 11], which 
the reader may refer to in order to gain a broader understanding, and to sample the 
various points of view held by researchers in the ﬁeld. 
We will begin with a brief review of the history of the ﬁeld of quantum gravity in 
the remainder of this section. Following this we provide a non-technical overview of 
some of the models and theories that are similar to LQG, in the interests of showing 
the reader some of the “landscape” of approaches to formulating a viable theory 
of quantum gravity. We will return to some of these ideas near the end of the text, 
once the technical details of LQG have been discussed. To begin our discussion of 
LQG proper, we review some topics in general relativity in Chap. 2 and quantum 
ﬁeld theory in Chap. 3, which hopefully fall into the “Goldilocks zone”, providing 
all the necessary basis for LQG, and nothing more. We may occasionally intro-
duce concepts in greater detail than the reader considers necessary, but we feel that 
when introducing concepts to a (hopefully) wide audience who ﬁnd them unfamiliar,

Introduction 
insufﬁcient detail is more harmful than excessive detail. We will discuss the 
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches to classical GR in more depth and set the 
stage for its quantization in Chap. 4 then sketch a conceptual outline of the broad 
program of quantization of the gravitational ﬁeld in Chap. 5, before moving on to our 
main discussion of the loop quantum gravity approach in Chap. 6. The pros and cons 
of the self-dual variables are also discussed in some depth in Sect. 5.3. In Chap. 8 we 
cover applications of the ideas and methods of LQG to the counting of microstates 
of black holes (Sect. 8.1) and to the problem of quantum cosmology (Sect. 8.2). Last, 
but not least, some common criticisms of LQG and our rebuttals thereof are presented 
in Chap. 9 along with a discussion of its present status and future prospects, and we 
discuss again (in more technical detail) some similar theories that may (in the course 
of future developments) borrow from, lend ideas to, or subsume LQG. 
It is assumed that the reader has a minimal familiarity with the tools and concepts 
of differential geometry, quantum ﬁeld theory, and general relativity, though we aim 
to remind the reader of any relevant technical details as necessary. 1 In light of the 
extensive use of concepts from group theory throughout the text, a brief summary of 
important concepts and notation relevant to Lie groups and Lie algebras is provided 
in Appendix A. While this material is widely covered in other texts and undergraduate 
courses, we feel it’s better to have it on hand for reference and not need it, than to 
need it and not have it. 
Before we begin, it would be helpful to give the reader a historical perspective of 
the developments in theoretical physics which have led us to the present stage. 
We are all familiar with classical geometry consisting of points, lines and surfaces. 
The framework of Euclidean geometry provided the mathematical foundation for 
Newton’s work on inertia and the laws of motion. In the 19normal t normal hth century Gauss, Riemann 
and Lobachevsky, among others, developed notions of curved geometries in which 
one or more of Euclid’s postulates were loosened. The resulting structures allowed 
Einstein and Hilbert to formulate the theory of general relativity which describes 
the motion of matter through spacetime as a consequence of the curvature of the 
background geometry. This curvature in turn is induced by the matter content as 
encoded in Einstein’s equations (2.10). Just as the parallel postulate was the unstated 
assumption of Newtonian mechanics, whose rejection led to Riemmanian geometry, 
the unstated assumption underlying the framework of general relativity is that of the 
smoothness and continuity of spacetime on all scales. 
Loop quantum gravity and related approaches invite us to consider that our notion 
of spacetime as a smooth continuum must give way to an atomistic description of 
geometry in which the classical spacetime we observe around us emerges from 
the interactions of countless (truly indivisible) atoms of spacetime. This idea is 
grounded in mathematically rigorous results, but is also a natural continuation of the 
trend that began when 19normal t normal hth century attempts to reconcile classical thermodynamics 
1 Given that we are aiming this book at a broad audience, we may even hope that some readers 
will ﬁnd it helpful with their understanding of GR and/or QFT, quite aside from its intended role 
explaining quantum gravity.

with the physics of radiation encountered fatal difﬁculties—such as James Jeans’ 
“ultraviolet catastrophe”. These difﬁculties were resolved only when work by Planck, 
Einstein and others in the early 20normal t normal hth century provided an atomistic description of 
electromagnetic radiation in terms of particles or “quanta” of light known as photons. 
This development spawned quantum mechanics, and in turn quantum ﬁeld theory, 
while around the same time the special and general theories of relativity were being 
developed. 
In the latter part of the 20normal t normal hth century physicists attempted, without much success, 
to unify the two great frameworks of quantum mechanics and general relativity. 
For the most part it was assumed that gravity was a phenomenon whose ultimate 
description was to be found in the form of a quantum ﬁeld theory as had been so 
dramatically and successfully accomplished for the electromagnetic, weak and strong 
forces in the framework known as the Standard Model (SM). These three forces 
could be understood as arising due to interactions between elementary particles 
mediated by gauge bosons whose symmetries were encoded in the groups U(1), 
SU(2) and SU(3) for the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces, respectively. The 
universal presumption was that the ﬁnal missing piece of this “grand uniﬁed” picture, 
gravity, would eventually be found as the QFT of some suitable gauge group. This 
was the motivation for the various Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUTs) developed by 
Glashow, Pati-Salam, Weinberg and others where the hope was that it would be 
possible to embed the gravitational interaction along with the Standard Model in 
some larger group (such SO(5), SO(10) or ESubscript 88 depending on the particular scheme). 
Such schemes could be said to be in conﬂict with Occam’s dictum of simplicity 
and Einstein and Dirac’s notions of beauty and elegance. More importantly all these 
models assumed implicitly that spacetime remains continuous at all scales. As we  
shall see this assumption lies at the heart of the difﬁculties encountered in unifying 
gravity with quantum mechanics. 
A signiﬁcant obstacle to the development of a theory of quantum gravity is the fact 
that GR is not renormalizable. The gravitational coupling constantscript upper GG (or equivalently 
1 divided by upper M Subscript upper P l a n c k Superscript 21/M2 
Planck in dimensionless “natural” units wherescript upper G equals c equals italic h over two pi equals 1G = c =  = 1) is not dimension-
less, unlike the ﬁne-structure constant alphaα in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This 
means that successive terms in any perturbative series have increasing powers of 
momenta in the numerator. Rejecting the notion that systems could absorb or trans-
mit energy in arbitrarily small amounts led to the photonic picture of electromagnetic 
radiation and the discovery of quantum mechanics. Likewise, rejecting the notion 
that spacetime is arbitrarily smooth at all scales—and replacing it with the idea that 
geometry at the Planck scale must have a discrete character—leads us to a possible 
resolution of the ultraviolet inﬁnities encountered in quantum ﬁeld theory and to a 
theory of “quantum gravity”. 
Bekenstein’s observation [ 12– 14] of the relationship between the entropy of a 
black hole and the area of its horizon combined with Hawking’s work on black hole 
thermodynamics led to the realization that there were profound connections between 
thermodynamics, information theory and black hole physics. These can be succinctly

that if geometrical observables such as area are quantized Eq. (1.1) can be seen as 
arising from the number of ways that one can join togetherupper NN quanta of area to form 
a horizon. In LQG the quantization of geometry arises naturally—though not all 
theorists are convinced that geometry should be quantized or that LQG is the right 
way to do so.  
1.2
Overview: Loop Quantum Gravity and Friends 
As just discussed, LQG is an attempt to describe gravity in a manner that is compatible 
with both general relativity and quantum ﬁeld theory. However, it is by no means 
the only attempt to do so. LQG is often compared, and set in opposition to, string 
theory. But it is perhaps fairer to characterise the various quantum gravity schemes as 
attempts to create a gravitational theory of quantum ﬁelds (i.e. starting with quantum 
ﬁeld theory and constructing a theory that recreates GR in some limit), and attempts 
to create a quantum theory of gravitational ﬁelds (i.e. starting with GR and attempting 
to quantise it). The former approach includes string theory and related ideas, while 
the latter approach includes loop quantum gravity and related ideas. 
At the time of writing there is no compelling experimental evidence to support 
a preference for one approach over the other. The various attempts to create a the-
ory of quantum gravity show promise in some regards, and face difﬁculties in their 
own ways. It is possible that a successful theory of quantum gravity will incorpo-
rate features of several existing approaches. To paraphrase Carlo Rovelli, at this 
stage humanity is not trying to decide between viable candidate theories of quan-
tum gravity—quite the opposite. Just ﬁnding one candidate that is compatible with 
experimental data would be a signiﬁcant advance! But at the same time this gives us 
hope that the space of possible theories is not overwhelming, and the requirement 
of consistency with quantum mechanics and general relativity should be a reliable 
guide to our goal. 
For the sake of introducing the concepts which will be developed here, it seems 
appropriate to start with a nontechnical overview of some of the ideas and terminol-
ogy related to loop quantum gravity. 
String theory falls into the ﬁrst category mentioned above—that of trying to create 
a gravitational theory of quantum ﬁelds. It postulates a ﬁxed, continuous background 
spacetime, 2 and fundamental entities existing within this background which are 
2 Some attempts have been made to develop background-independent formulations, see for instance 
Smolin’s contribution to [ 15].

extended rather than pointlike. The various topologies and quantised vibrations of 
these “strings” give rise to a range of fermions and bosons, and the claim that string 
theory is a theory of quantum gravity rests upon the idea that the bosons which 
occur amongst these vibrations include the graviton. The quantisation procedure in 
string theory implies the existence of several dimensions beyond the three spatial and 
one temporal dimension of everyday experience, explaining this disparity through 
the idea that the extra dimensions are rolled up or “compactiﬁed” to a length scale 
well below detection with current experiments. The number of extra dimensions 
necessary is also modiﬁed by the incorporation of supersymmetry, leading to the 
name “superstrings”. 
Loop quantum gravity falls into the second category—that of creating a quan-
tum theory of gravitational ﬁelds. In general the starting point for this approach is 
the idea that connections and paths between different points in spacetime are more 
important than the coordinates of the points. Curvature of spacetime corresponds to 
gravitational ﬁelds, and this curvature is both dynamical, and independent of any 
embedding in a background space. This is what we meant when we said in Sect. 1.1 
that GR is taken “at face value”. Perhaps the most explicit example of the idea that 
relations between points in spacetime are more important than coordinates is causal 
set theory. This starts with a set of points and a partial ordering (i.e. a sense in which 
some pairs of points, but not all, can be compared to see which point comes “before” 
the other), and attempts to build the structure of spacetime from these ingredients, 
developing concepts of geometry, geodesics, and so forth from the combinations 
of the interrelations between points. Causal sets are similar in many ways to Pen-
rose’s conception of spin networks, which were created with the goal of building 
spacetime structure entirely from combinatorial rules. While it is extremely easy to 
take a smooth manifold and approximate it by a set of points, deﬁning a smooth 
manifold from an arbitrarily-generated set of points—sometimes referred to as the 
“inverse problem”—has presented a considerable challenge within causal set the-
ory for some time (see, for instance, Stachel and Smolin’s respective contributions 
to [ 15].) Another approach with a similar goal is Causal Dynamical Triangulations 
(CDT) [ 16]. These are an outgrowth of Regge calculus (Appendix I), which aimed to 
simplify calculations in general relativity by approximating spacetime by a collec-
tion of small sections, or simplices. Dynamical triangulations developed from this 
in an attempt to see if an nn-dimensional spacetime could develop (subject to certain 
dynamical rules) from an left parenthesis n minus 1 right parenthesis(n − 1)-dimensional collection of simplices, but it was 
discovered that without a sense of causality (such that edges which have an asso-
ciated time direction are oriented to agree with each other) the resulting structures 
were unphysical. This may be seen as another manifestation of the inverse problem 
that occurs in causal set theory. With the imposition of causality, CDT has shown 
itself to be capable of numerically simulating the formation of manifolds (with a dis-
crete structure) that appear to grow like inﬂating “mini-universes”, and approximate 
4-dimensional spacetime at large scales. 
Loop quantum gravity and spin foams are often mentioned in the same breath, but it 
is worth recognising that they developed somewhat in parallel. Loop quantum gravity 
was infused with the concept of spin networks, creating a viable set of kinematical

states to describe quantum spacetime. Spin foams grew out of concepts like BF theory 
(Sect. 7.2), providing a concept of dynamics in need of a kinematics to complete it—a 
role which LQG has stepped in to ﬁll. We shall mention almost all of these ideas, and 
more, in greater detail throughout the rest of this book. But hopefully this overview 
serves to familiarise the reader with the names of various theories and models, and 
show that there is a lot to learn, and that many more discoveries lie ahead. For the 
interested reader, a more thorough survey of these ideas is provided by Smolin in 
[ 15]. The history of the quest for a viable theory of quantum gravity, like all of 
science, is one of ideas converging, combining serendipitously, and spawning new 
and unexpected avenues for exploration. Even loop quantum gravity and string theory 
(as just noted, so frequently cast as opponents) show signs of ﬁnding common ground 
in recent years. 
With this historical summary and overview in mind, it is now worth covering the 
basic notions of general relativity and QFT before we attempt to see how these two 
disciplines may be uniﬁed in a single framework.

General Relativity (GR) is an extension of Einstein’s theory of Special Relativ-
ity (SR), which was required in order to include observers in non-trivial gravita-
tional backgrounds. SR applies in the absence of gravity, and in essence it describes 
the behavior of vector quantities in a four-dimensional Galilean space, with the 
Minkowski metric1

The speed of a light signal, measured by any inertial observer, is a constant, denoted 
cc. If we denote the components of a vector in four-dimensional spacetime with Greek 
indices (e.g.v Superscript muvμ) the Minkowski metric 2 divides vectors into three categories; timelike 
(those vectors for which eta Subscript mu nu Baseline v Superscript mu Baseline v Superscript nu Baseline less than 0ημνvμvν < 0), null or light-like (those vectors for which 
eta Subscript mu nu Baseline v Superscript mu Baseline v Superscript nu Baseline equals 0ημνvμvν = 0), and spacelike (those vectors for which eta Subscript mu nu Baseline v Superscript mu Baseline v Superscript nu Baseline greater than 0ημνvμvν > 0). Any point, 
with coordinatesleft parenthesis c t comma x comma y comma z right parenthesis(ct, x, y, z), is referred to as an event, and the set of all null vectors 
having their origin at any event deﬁne the future light-cone and past light-cone of that 
event (Fig. 2.1). Events having time-like or null displacement from a given eventupper E 0E0
(i.e. lying inside or onupper E 0E0’s lightcones) are causally connected toupper E 0E0. Those in/on the 
past light-cone can inﬂuence upper E 0E0, those in/on the future lightcone can be inﬂuenced 
by upper E 0E0.

restrict our attention to the spacial part of the metric, in which case a positive (spatial) line-element 
is cleaner to work with.

be zero.

and hence map directly to that observer’s celestial sphere
General relativity extends these concepts to non-Euclidean spacetime. The metric 
of this (possibly curved) spacetime is denoted g Subscript mu nugμν. Around each event (i.e. point in 
spacetime) it is possible to consider a sufﬁciently small region that the curvature of 
spacetime within this region is negligible, and hence the central concepts of special 
relativity apply locally. Rather than developing the idea that the curvature of space-
time gives rise to gravitational effects, we shall treat this as assumed knowledge, 
and discuss how the curvature of spacetime may be investigated. In general one can-
not usefully extend the coordinate system in the region of one event to the region 
of another arbitrary event since spacetime is not assumed to be ﬂat and Euclidean 
(we’ll deﬁne “ﬂat” and “curved” rigorously below). This can be seen from the fact 
that a Cartesian coordinate system which deﬁned “up” to be the zz-axis at one point 
on the surface of the Earth, would have to deﬁne “up” not to be parallel to thezz-axis 
at most other points. In short, a freely-falling reference frame cannot be extended to 
each point in the vicinity of the surface of the Earth—or any other gravitating body. 
We are thus forced to work with local coordinate systems which vary from region 
to region. We shall refer to the basis vectors of these local coordinate systems by 
the symbols e Subscript je j. A set of four such basis vectors at any event is called a tetrad or 
vierbein. The discussion of tetrads will be taken up again in Sect. 4.3.2. The metric 
is related to the dot product of basis vectors by g Subscript j k Baseline equals e Subscript j Baseline dot e Subscript kg jk = e j · ek. In an orthonormal 
basis with Euclidean metric the convenient relation e Subscript j Baseline dot e Subscript k Baseline equals delta Subscript j ke j · ek = δ jk holds true. As the 
basis vectors are not necessarily orthonormal in general, we may deﬁne another set 
of vectors e Superscript je j, which satisfy the analogous relationship e Superscript j Baseline dot e Subscript k Baseline equals delta Subscript k Superscript je j · ek = δ j
k . The e Superscript je j will be 
referred to as the dual basis vectors or covectors.

vectors with respect to the dual basis. These dual vectors will have components with 
lowered indices, for examplev Subscript jv j, and take the general formv Subscript j Baseline e Superscript jv je j. The metric is used

to switch between components referred to the basis or dual basis, e.g. v Subscript k Baseline equals g Subscript j k Baseline v Superscript jvk = g jkv j. 
Vectors deﬁned with raised indices on their components are called ‘contravariant 
vectors’ or simply ‘vectors’. Those with lowered indices are called ‘covariant vectors, 
‘covectors’ or ‘1-forms’. 3 Note that thee Subscript je j, having lowered indices, are basis vectors 
while thee Superscript je j, having raised indices, are basis 1-forms. We will return to the distinction 
between vectors and 1-forms in Sect. 3.2. 
When we differentiate a vector along a curve parametrised by the coordinate x Superscript kxk
we must apply the product rule, as the vector itself can change direction and length, 
and the local basis will in general also change along the curve, hence

transported along a path, its covariant derivative will be zero. In consequence any 
change in the components of the vector is due to (and hence equal and opposite to) 
the change in local basis, so that

The transport of a vector along a single path between two distinct points does not 
reveal any curvature of the space (or spacetime) through which the vector is carried. 
To detect curvature it is necessary to carry a vector all the way around a closed path 
and back to its starting point, and compare its initial and ﬁnal orientations. If they
3 The terms covariant and contravariant come about in reference to whether the quantity transforms 
the same way as or oppositely to the basis vectors, but applying it to a vector likeModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow equals v Superscript j Baseline e Subscript j →V = v je j, which  
has no uncontracted indices, is something of a misnomer. It is really the components—referred to a 
particular choice of basis—that vary, so an expression like ‘contravariant (covariant) vector’ should 
be understood as shorthand for “vector with components deﬁned with respect to a particular basis 
(dual basis).”

Fig. 2.2 The parallel transport of a vector around a closed path tells us about the curvature of a 
region bounded by that path. Here a vector is parallel transported along curve .λ1 from A to B, 
and back from B to A along .λ2. Both  .λ1 and .λ2 are sections of great circles, and so we can see 
that the vector maintains a constant angle to the tangent to the curve between A and B, but this 
angle changes abruptly at B when the vector switches from.λ1 to.λ2. The difference in initial and 
ﬁnal orientation of the vector at A tells us that the surface (a sphere in this case) is curved. Just as 
an arbitrarily curved path in.R2 can be built up from straight line segments, an arbitrary path in a 
curved manifold can be built up from sections of geodesics (of which great circles are an example) 
are the same, for an arbitrary path, the space (or spacetime) is ﬂat. If they differ, 
the space is curved, and the amount by which the initial and ﬁnal orientations of 
the vector differ provides a measure of how much curvature is enclosed within the 
path. Alternatively, one may transport two copies of a vector from the same starting 
point, A, along different paths,lamda 1λ1 andlamda 2λ2 to a common end-point, B. Comparing the 
orientations of the vectors after they have been transported along these two different 
paths reveals whether the space is ﬂat or curved. It should be obvious that this is 
equivalent to following a closed path (moving alonglamda 1λ1 from A to B, and then along 
lamda 2λ2 from B to A, c.f. Fig. 2.2). The measure of how much this closed path (loop) differs 
from a loop in ﬂat space (that is, how much the two transported vectors at B differ 
from each other) is called the holonomy of the loop. The reader is cautioned that the 
term ‘holonomy’ is sometimes used with different meanings in different contexts. 
To (hopefully) minimise confusion we shall employ the term “loop holonomy” for 
the concept we have just introduced. 
In light of the preceding discussion, suppose a vectorModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow →V is transported from point 
A some distance in themuμ-direction. The effect of this transport upon the components 
of ModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow →V is given by the covariant derivative nabla Subscript mu Baseline∇μ of ModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow →V . The vector is then transported in 
the nuν-direction to arrive at point B. An identical copy of the vector is carried ﬁrst 
from A in the nuν-direction, and then in the muμ-direction to B. The difference between 
the two resulting (transported) vectors, when they arrive at B is given by

Since the terms in the commutator of covariant derivatives differ only in the

Einstein’s Field Equations 
Einstein’s equations relate the curvature of spacetime with the energy density of the 
matter and ﬁelds present in the spacetime. Deﬁning the Ricci tensor upper R Subscript rho nu Baseline equals upper R Superscript mu Baseline Subscript rho mu nuRρν = Rμρμν
and the Ricci scalar upper R equals upper R Superscript nu Baseline Subscript nuR = Rνν (i.e. it is the trace of the Ricci tensor, taken after 
raising an index using the metric g Superscript mu nugμν), the relationship between energy density and 
spacetime curvature is then given by 
upper R Superscript mu nu Baseline minus one half upper R g Superscript mu nu Baseline plus normal upper Lamda g Superscript mu nu Baseline equals 8 pi script upper G upper T Superscript mu nu Baseline commaRμν −1
2 Rgμν + ∆gμν = 8πGT μν,
(2.10) 
where script upper GG is Newton’s constant, and the coefﬁcient normal upper Lamda∆is the cosmological constant, 
which prior to the 1990s was believed to be identically zero. The tensor upper T Superscript mu nuT μν is 
the energy-momentum tensor (also referred to as the stress-energy tensor). We will 
not discuss it in great detail, but its components describe the ﬂux of energy and 
momentum (i.e. 4-momentum) across various timelike and spacelike surfaces. 4 The 
component upper T Superscript mu nuT μν describes the ﬂux of the mu normal t normal hμth component of 4-momentum across 
a surface of constant x Superscript nuxν. For instance, the zeroeth component of 4-momentum is 
energy, and hence upper T Superscript 00T 00 is the amount of energy crossing a surface of constant t i m etime
(i.e. energy per unit volume that is moving into the future but stationary in space, 
hence it is the energy density). 
It should be noted that we can writenormal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript rho┌ρ

Since the Riemann tensor is deﬁned from the covariant derivative, and the covariant 
derivative is deﬁned by the connection, the metric g Superscript mu nugμν should be interpreted as a 
solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations (EFEs), Eq. (2.10).
4 The presence of the energy-momentum tensor is related to the fact that it is not merely the mass of 
matter that creates gravity, but its momentum, as required to maintain consistency when transforming 
between various Lorentz-boosted frames.

It is sometimes preferable to write Eq. (2.10) in the form 
upper G Superscript mu nu Baseline equals 8 pi script upper G upper T Superscript mu nu Baseline minus normal upper Lamda g Superscript mu nuGμν = 8πGT μν −∆gμν
(2.12) 
where the Einstein tensor upper G Superscript mu nu Baseline equals upper R Superscript mu nu Baseline minus upper R g Superscript mu nu Baseline divided by 2Gμν = Rμν −Rgμν/2 is the divergence-free part of the 
Ricci tensor. The explicit form of Eq. (2.10) emphasises the relationship between 
mass-energy and spacetime curvature. All the quantities related to the structure of 
the spacetime (i.e.upper R Superscript mu nuRμν,upper RR,g Superscript mu nugμν) are on the left-hand side. The quantity related to the 
presence of matter and energy, upper T Superscript mu nuT μν, is on the right-hand side. For now it remains 
a question of interpretation whether this means that mass-energy is equivalent to 
spacetime curvature, or identical to it. Perhaps more importantly the form of the 
EFEs makes it clear that GR is a theory of dynamical spacetime. As matter and 
energy move, so the curvature of the spacetime in their vicinity changes. 
It is worth noting (without proof, see for instance [ 1]) that the gravitational ﬁeld 
in the simplest case of a static, spherically-symmetric ﬁeld around a massupper MM, deﬁnes 
a line element of the form derived by Schwarzschild,

For weak gravitational ﬁelds, and test masses moving at low velocities (that is,v much less than cv << c) 
the majority of the deviation from the line element in empty space is caused by the 
coefﬁcent of the normal d t squareddt2 term on the right. This situation also coincides with the limit 
in which Newtonian gravity becomes a good description of the mechanics. In the 
Newtonian picture the force of gravity can be written as the gradient of a potential,

implying that gravity in the Newtonian or weak-ﬁeld limit can be understood, pri-
marily, as the amount of distortion in the local “speed” of time caused by the presence 
of matter—an effect known as gravitational time dilation. 
2.3
Coordinates and Diffeomorphism Invariance 
General relativity embodies a principle called diffeomorphism invariance. This prin-
ciple states, in essence, that the laws of physics should be invariant under different 
choices of coordinates. In fact, one may say that coordinates have no meaning in the 
formulation of physical laws, and in principle we could do without them. 
In a practical sense, however, when performing calculations it is often necessary 
to work with a particular choice of coordinates. When translating in spacetime we 
may ﬁnd that the basis vectors are deﬁned differently at different points (giving rise 
to a connection, as we saw above). However if we restrict our attention to a particular

point we ﬁnd that the coordinate basis may be changed by performing a transfor-
mation on the basis, leading to new coordinates derived from the old coordinates. 
Transformations of coordinates take a well-known form, which we will brieﬂy recap. 
Suppose the two coordinate systems have basis vectors x Superscript 1 Baseline comma ellipsis comma x Superscript nx1, . . . , xn and y Superscript 1 Baseline comma ellipsis comma y Superscript ny1, . . . , yn. 
Then for a given vector ModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow →V with components u Subscript iui and v Subscript jv j in the two coordinate sys-
tems it must be true that u Subscript i Baseline x Superscript i Baseline equals ModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow equals v Subscript j Baseline y Superscript jui xi = →V = v j y j. Differentiating with respect to yy, the 
relationship between coordinate systems is given by 
v Subscript j Baseline equals u Subscript i Baseline StartFraction partial differential x Superscript i Baseline Over partial differential y Superscript j Baseline EndFraction periodv j = ui
∂xi
∂y j .
(2.16) 
This tells us how to ﬁnd the components of a vector in a “new” coordinate system (the 
yy-basis), given the components in the “old” coordinate system (the xx-basis). Let us 
writeupper J Subscript j Superscript i Baseline equals partial differential x Superscript i Baseline divided by partial differential y Superscript jJ i
j = ∂xi/∂y j, and then since a summation is implied overii the transformation 
of coordinates can be written in terms of a matrix acting upon the components 
of vectors, v Subscript j Baseline equals upper J Subscript j Superscript i Baseline u Subscript iv j = J i
jui. Such a matrix, relating two coordinate systems is called a 
Jacobian matrix. While one transformation matrix is needed to act upon vectors 
(which have only a single index), one transformation matrix per index is needed for 
more complex objects, e.g. 
v Subscript i j k Baseline equals upper J Subscript i Superscript p Baseline upper J Subscript j Superscript r Baseline upper J Subscript k Superscript s Baseline u Subscript p r s Baseline periodvi jk = J p

(2.17) 
Since the metric deﬁnes angles and lengths (and hence areas and volumes) calcula-
tions involving the volume of a region of spacetime (e.g. integration of a Lagrangian) 
must introduce a supplementary factor of StartRoot negative g EndRoot√−g (where gg is the determinant of the 
metric g Superscript mu nugμν) in order to remain invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations.

The square root of the determinant of the metric is an important factor in deﬁning 
areas, as we can see by considering a parallelogram whose sides are deﬁned by two 
vectors,ModifyingAbove x With right arrow→x andModifyingAbove y With right arrow→y which are at an anglethetaθ to each other. The area of this parallelogram 
is given by the magnitude of the cross product of these vectors, hence

It is therefore reasonable to expect an analogous function of the metric to play a 
role in changes of coordinates. Furthermore we would expect the total area of some 
two-dimensional surface, which can be broken up into many small parallelograms, 
to be given by integrating the areas of such parallelograms together (this point will 
be taken up again in Sect. 6.3).

sider an inﬁnitessimal region of a space. Let this region be a parallelepiped in some 
coordinate system x Superscript 1 Baseline comma ellipsis comma x Superscript nx1, . . . , xn. Now suppose we want to change to a different set of 
coordinates, y Superscript 1 Baseline comma ellipsis comma y Superscript ny1, . . . , yn, which are functions of the ﬁrst set (e.g. we want to change 
from polar coordinates to cartesian). The Jacobian of this transformation is

The entries in the Jacobian matrix are the elements of the vectors deﬁning the sides 
of the inﬁnitessimal region we began with, referred to the new basis. Each row 
corresponds with one vector, and the absolute value of the determinant of such 
a matrix, multiplied by d Superscript n Baseline y equals d y Superscript 1 Baseline ellipsis d y Superscript ndny = dy1 . . . dyn gives the volume of the inﬁnitessimal 
region. An integral referred to these new coordinates must include a factor of this 
volume, to ensure that the coordinates have been transformed correctly and the 
integral doesn’t over-count the inﬁnitessimal regions of which it is composed, hence

The Jacobian matrix deﬁnes the transformation between coordinate systems. To 
be speciﬁc, we will choose the Minkowski metriceta Subscript mu nuημν for the ﬁrst coordinate system.

We can treat this expression as a product of matrices. If we do so, we must be careful 
about the ordering of terms, since matrix multiplication is non-commutative, and 
it is useful to replace one of the Jacobian matrices by its transpose. However this 
extra complication can be avoided since we are interested in the determinants of

The transformations described above, where a new coordinate basis is derived 
from an old one is called a passive transformation. By contrast, it is possible to leave 
the coordinate basis unchanged and instead change the positions of objects, whose 
coordinates will consequently change as measured in this basis. This is called an 
active coordinate transformation. With this distinction in mind, we will elaborate on 
the concept of diffeomorphism invariance in GR. 
A diffeomorphism is a mapping of coordinates f colon x right arrow f left parenthesis x right parenthesis f : x →f (x) from a manifold 
script upper M 1M1 to a manifold script upper M 2M2 that is smooth, invertible, one-to-one, and onto. As a special 
case we can takescript upper M 1M1 andscript upper M 2M2 to be the same manifold, and deﬁne a diffeomorphism 
from a spacetime manifold to itself. A passive diffeomorphism will change the coor-
dinates, but leave objects based on them unchanged, so that for instance the metric 
before a passive diffeomorphism isg Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgμν(x) and after it isg Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis f left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesisgμν( f (x)). Invariance under 
passive diffeomorphisms is nothing special, as any physical theory can be made to 
yield the same results under a change of coordinates. An active diffeomorphism, on 
the other hand, would yield a new metric g prime Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisg'
μν(x), which would in general measure 
different distances between any two points than doesg Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgμν(x). General relativity is sig-
niﬁcant for being invariant under active diffeomorphisms. This invariance requires 
that if g Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgμν(x) is any solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations, an active diffeomor-
phism yields g prime Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisg'
μν(x) which must be another valid solution of the EFEs. We require 
that any theory of quantum gravity should also embody a notion of diffeomorphism 
invariance, or at the very least, should exhibit a suitable notion of diffeomorphism 
invariance in the classical limit. 
An understanding of classical general relativity helps us to better understand 
transformations between locally-deﬁned coordinate systems. We will now proceed 
to a discussion of quantum ﬁeld theory, where these local coordinate systems are 
abstracted to “internal” coordinates. And just as the discussion of GR provides us 
with tools to more easily visualise the concepts at the heart of QFT, the quantisation 
of ﬁeld theories discussed in the next section will lay the foundations for our account 
of the attempts to extend classical GR into a quantum theory of gravity.

Quantum Field Theory 
Quantum Field Theory should be familiar to most (if not all) modern physicists, 
however we feel it is worth mentioning the basic details here, in order to emphasize 
the similarities between QFT and GR, and hence illustrate how GR can be written as 
a gauge theory. In short, we will see that a local change of phase of the wavefunction 
is equivalent to the position-dependent change of basis we considered in the case 
of GR. Just as the partial derivative of a vector gave (via the product rule) a deriva-
tive term corresponding to the change in basis, we will see that a derivative term 
arises corresponding to the change in phase of the quantum ﬁeld. This introduces a 
connection and a covariant derivative deﬁned in terms of the connection.

role of basis vectors, the phi left parenthesis x right parenthesis Subscript jφ(x) j playing the role of the components, and summation

μ = Aμ −∂μζ .
(3.6) 
Since we deﬁned upper A Subscript mu Baseline equals partial differential Subscript mu Baseline thetaAμ = ∂μθ above, the presence of a minus sign might be a bit 
surprising. Surely from the deﬁnition ofupper A Subscript muAμ we expect thatpartial differential theta Superscript prime Baseline equals partial differential theta plus partial differential zeta∂θ' = ∂θ + ∂ζ. However  
what Eq. (3.6) is telling us is simply that when we locally change the basis of a 
wavefunction but leave the overall physics unchanged, the connection must change 
in an equal and opposite manner to compensate. This is akin to the concept of 
diffeomorphism invariance discussed in Sect. 2.3. In both GR and QFT there are two 
ways to change the local coordinate basis. The ﬁrst is by moving from an initial 
position to a new position where the basis is deﬁned differently. The second is by 
staying at one point and performing a transformation (a diffeomorphism in GR, 
a gauge transformation in QFT) to change the coordinate basis. In each case, we 
want the laws of physics to remain the same, despite any change to the chosen 
coordinate basis. We can see how this condition is enforced by the transformation of

tells us how the phase of the wavefunction at each point corresponds to the phase at 
a different point, in analogy to the connection in GR which told us how coordinate 
bases varied from point to point, but additionally the requirement that the action 
be invariant under local gauge transformations necessitates that it is not simply the 
wavefunction, but also the connection that changes under a gauge transformation. 
The discussion above has been restricted to the case of a simple rotation of the 
phase (that is, e Superscript bold i g zeta Baseline element of upper U left parenthesis 1 right parenthesiseigζ ∈U(1), the rotation group of the plane). In GR, by contrast, 
the local bases at different points may be rotated in three dimensions relative to 
each other (that is, the basis vectors are acted upon by elements of SO(3)). We can 
accordingly generalise the discussion above to include phase rotations arising from

psiψ by a Dirac doublet

has a parallel statement in the language of gauge theory. In a gauge theory, matter is 
represented by the ﬁeldspsiψ whereas the “geometry” (not of the background spacetime, 
but of the interactions between the particles) is determined by the conﬁgurations of 
the gauge ﬁeld. The core idea of GR can then be generalised to an equivalent idea in 
ﬁeld theoretic terms, 
Gauge charges tell gauge ﬁelds how to curve and gauge ﬁelds tell gauge charges how to 
move. 
Now, what we have so far is an action, Eq. (3.11) which describes the dynamics 
of spinorial ﬁelds, interactions between which are mediated by the gauge ﬁeld. The 
gauge ﬁeld itself is not yet a dynamic quantity. In any gauge theory, consistency 
demands that the ﬁnal action should also include terms which describe the dynamics 
of the gauge ﬁeld alone. We know this to be true from our experience with QED where 
the gauge ﬁeld becomes a particle called the photon. From classical electrodynamics 
Maxwell’s equations possess propagating solutions of the gauge ﬁeld - or more 
simply electromagnetic waves. The term giving the dynamics of the gauge ﬁeld 
can be uniquely determined from the requirement of gauge invariance. We need to 
construct out of the ﬁeld strength an expression with no indices. This can be achieved 
by contractingupper F Subscript mu nu Superscript upper IF I
μν with itself and then taking the trace over the Lie algebra indices. 
Doing this we get the term

The ﬁeld strength is usually ﬁrst encountered in the case of electromagnetism, where

Since each component of upper F Subscript mu nuFμν is associated with two index values, we can think of 
the components as “bivectors” (oriented areas lying in the muμ-nuν plane), in analogy

Quantum Field Theory
Fig. 3.1 Wedge products of basis vectors deﬁne basis bivectors, basis trivectors, and so on. While a 
vector’s magnitude is its length, a bivector’s magnitude is its area, and the magnitude of a trivector 
is its volume. The orientation of the unit bivector and unit trivector are shown here by the dashed 
arrows. The ﬁeld strength .Fμν can be represented as a set of bivectors oriented between pairs of 
timelike and spacelike axes in four dimensions (shown here by distorting the angles between axes, 
as is done in a two-dimensional drawing of a cube). Shaded (unshaded) bivectors in the rightmost 
diagram are the magnetic (electric) ﬁeld components 
with vectors which carry only a single index (and are oriented lengths lying along 
a single axis). For the reader unfamiliar with bivectors we will very quickly review 
them. 
A unit basis vectore Subscript lel can be visualised as a line segment with a “tail” and a “head”, 
and an orientation given by traversing the vector from its tail to its head. A general 
vector is a linear combination of basis vectors,ModifyingAbove v With right arrow equals v Superscript 1 Baseline e 1 plus v squared e 2 plus v cubed e 3 plus ellipsis→v = v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3 + . . . where 
thev Superscript lvl are scalars. Similarly a unit basis bivector can be visualised as an area bounded 
by the vectorse Subscript lel ande Subscript mem, written as the wedge producte Subscript l Baseline and e Subscript mel ∧em, and with an orientation 
deﬁned by traversing the boundary of this area along the ﬁrst side, in the same 
direction ase Subscript lel, then along the second side parallel toe Subscript mem, and continuing anti-parallel 
to e Subscript lel and e Subscript mem to arrive back at the origin (this concept can be extended arbitrarily to 
deﬁne trivectors, etc. as illustrated in Fig. 3.1. Such a construction wedgingkk vectors 
together is called akk-blade 3 and a linear combination ofkk-blades, for several values 
of kk, is called a multivector). 
A general bivector is a linear combination of basis bivectors. Writing the ﬁeld 
strength as such a general bivector we ﬁnd that it takes the form 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column upper F Subscript mu nu Baseline equals 2nd Column upper E 1 left parenthesis e 1 and e 0 right parenthesis plus upper E 2 left parenthesis e 2 and e 0 right parenthesis plus upper E 3 left parenthesis e 3 and e 0 right parenthesis 2nd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column plus upper B 1 left parenthesis e 2 and e 3 right parenthesis plus upper B 2 left parenthesis e 3 and e 1 right parenthesis plus upper B 3 left parenthesis e 1 and e 2 right parenthesis period EndLayoutFμν = E1(e1 ∧e0) + E2(e2 ∧e0) + E3(e3 ∧e0)
+ B1(e2 ∧e3) + B2(e3 ∧e1) + B3(e1 ∧e2).
(3.21) 
Notice that the ordering of indices on the wedge productsleft parenthesis e Subscript mu Baseline and e Subscript nu Baseline right parenthesis(eμ ∧eν) has been arranged 
to match the mu Superscript t hmuμmu Superscript t h row and nu Superscript t hnuνnu Superscript t h column of Eq. (3.20). Electric ﬁelds are those parts 
of upper F Subscript mu nuFμν lying in a plane deﬁned by one space axis and the time axis, while magnetic 
ﬁelds are those lying in a plane deﬁned by two space axes (Fig. 3.1). Reversing the 
orientation of a bivector is equivalent to traversing its boundary “backwards”, so we 
may writee Subscript mu Baseline and e Subscript nu Baseline equals minus e Subscript nu Baseline and e Subscript mueμ ∧eν = −eν ∧eμ. This is consistent with the fact that the ﬁeld strength 
is antisymmetric, i.e. upper F Subscript mu nu Baseline equals minus upper F Subscript nu muFμν = −Fνμ.
3 The termkk-vector is also used, though we feel it is best avoided as it could lead to confusion with 
the concept of a vector inkk dimensions.

where we can of course raise or lower indices on the ﬁeld strength tensor and antisym-
metric tensor using the metric. We can see that the mapping between ﬁeld strength and 
dual ﬁeld strength 4 associates a given electric ﬁeld component with a corresponding 
magnetic ﬁeld component, such that upper E Subscript i Baseline right arrow minus upper B Subscript iEi →−Bi and upper B Subscript j Baseline right arrow upper E Subscript jB j →E j. Thinking in terms 
of bivectors, the quantity deﬁned on the plane between any pair of spacetime axes is 
associated to the quantity deﬁned on the plane between the other two spacetime axes. 
The ﬁeld strength is said to be self-dual ifstar upper F equals plus upper F⋆F = +F, and anti-self-dual ifstar upper F equals negative upper F⋆F = −F. 
Although we will not be concerned with (anti-)self-dual ﬁeld strengths in the rest of 
this book, we will be dealing with (anti-)self-dual gauge connections from Sect. 5.1 
onwards. The EM ﬁeld strength as presented here is merely the simplest example 
to use to introduce the concept of self-duality, and illustrate its physical meaning. 
Further discussion of duality, for the reader requiring a deeper understanding, is pre-
sented in the appendices, Sect. B.3. Some readers will also no doubt have noticed the 
similarity between bivectors e Subscript l Baseline and e Subscript mel ∧em, and differential 2-forms d x Superscript l and d x Superscript mdxl ∧dxm. The two 
are indeed very similar. 
A bivector deﬁned by the wedge product of two vectors ModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v can be imagined 
as a parallelogram with two sides parallel toModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u, and the other sides parallel toModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v. The 
magnitude of this bivector is the area of the enclosed parallelogram. 5 Differential 
forms, on the other hand, have a magnitude which is thought of as a density. This is 
often drawn as a series of lines (similar to the contour lines on a topographical map or 
the isobars on a weather map) with smaller spacing between lines indicating higher 
density (Fig. 3.2). Hence a 1-form can be thought of as a density of contour lines 
or contour surfaces perpendicular to the direction of the 1-form. The inner product 
of a vector with a 1-form is a scalar - the number of lines that the vector crosses. 
Similarly a 2-form can be thought of as a series of contours spreading out through a 
plane (this plane being deﬁned by the directions of the two 1-forms wedged together 
to make the 2-form). Clearly there is a one-to-one mapping between vectors and 
1-forms, and between bivectors and 2-forms, which simply involves changing one’s 
choice of magnitude, left parenthesis length or area right parenthesis left right arrow left parenthesis density right parenthesis(length or area) ↔(density). 
It is certainly more common to see 1-forms, 2-forms, and other higher-dimensional 
forms used throughout physics, but kk-blades and multivectors can be very useful 
too, and are often easier to visualise (see Appendix B for a further discussion of
4 The notationupper F overTilde ˜F is also used for the dual ﬁeld strength. 
5 Bivectors could just as well be visualised as disks or ellipses or any other planar shape. The area 
and orientation are what really matter. But describing them as parallelograms helps motivate the 
process of building up bivectors, trivectors, etc. by wedging together several vectors.

Fig. 3.2 Two vectors (far left) with the same direction and different magnitudes differ in length, 
while two bivectors (left) differ in their areas. The magnitude of .k-forms is a density, and can be 
represented by interval lines. A 1-form (right) has a direction (indicated by the hollow arrows), just 
like a vector, but the spacing of interval lines represents its magnitude. A 2-form (far right) deﬁnes 
a plane, just like a bivector does, and once again the magnitude is represented by the spacing of 
interval lines. In all cases, the greater magnitude object is on the top row 
the relationship between kk-blades and differential forms). The use of kk-blades in 
preference to differential forms has been extensively developed by Hestenes [ 5].

Wilson Loops and Holonomies 
In Chap. 2 we deﬁned a loop holonomy as a measure of how much the initial and 
ﬁnal values of a vector transported around a closed loop differ. The discussion in the 
previous section demonstrates that the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor can 
also be position-dependant, and hence it should be possible to deﬁne a loop holonomy 
by the difference between the initial and ﬁnal values of a spinor transported around 
a closed loop. 6 As a ﬁrst step to constructing such a deﬁnition, let us consider what 
happens when we compare the values of a ﬁeld at different points, separated by a 
displacement d x Superscript mudxμ. We begin by using Eqs. (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) to write 
StartFraction d psi Over d x Superscript mu Baseline EndFraction equals StartFraction partial differential phi Over partial differential x Superscript mu Baseline EndFraction omega plus phi StartFraction partial differential omega Over partial differential x Superscript mu Baseline EndFraction equals omega left parenthesis partial differential Subscript mu Baseline plus bold i g upper A Subscript mu Baseline right parenthesis phi dψ

from which by comparing terms we readily see that bold i g upper A Subscript mu Baseline omega equals partial differential Subscript mu Baseline omegaigAμω = ∂μω, or equivalently 
bold i g upper A Subscript mu Baseline omega d x Superscript mu Baseline equals d omegaigAμωdxμ = dω. The internal components of the ﬁelds will be related by a gauge 
rotation which we will call upper U left parenthesis d x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesisU(dxμ). The action of this rotation can be expanded as 
upper U left parenthesis d x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis omega equals omega plus d omega equals omega plus bold i g upper A Subscript mu Baseline omega d x Superscript mu Baseline equals left parenthesis 1 plus bold i g upper A Subscript mu Baseline d x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis omegaU(dxμ)ω = ω + dω = ω + igAμωdxμ = (1 + igAμdxμ)ω
(3.24) 
and we immediately see that 
upper U left parenthesis d x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis equals exp left brace bold i g upper A Subscript mu Baseline d x Superscript mu Baseline right brace periodU(dxμ) = exp{igAμdxμ} .
(3.25)
6 The name holonomy is also used within the LQG community to refer to a loop or closed path. 
We feel this is unnecessarily confusing, hence our choice to use “loop holonomy” for a quantity 
associated to a closed path, and to avoid using the term “holonomy” for a closed path itself. The 
reader should be aware that this terminology does, however, exist within the wider literature.

upper U left parenthesis d x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesisU(dxμ) is the parallel transport operator that allows us to bring two ﬁeld values at 
different positions together so that they may be compared. Remembering that the

rotation is simply the identity matrix andpsiψ is unchanged by being parallel transported 
along the path. In general, however, the connection will not vanish. 
Now consider the situation when the pathlamdaλ is a closed loop, i.e. its beginning and 
end-point coincide. Analogously to the situation for a curved manifold, where the 
parallel transport of a vector along a closed path gives us a measure of the curvature 
of the spacetime bounded by that path, the parallel transport of a spinor around a 
closed path yields a measure of the gauge curvature living on a surface bounded by 
this path. We can see this simply in the case of a small square “plaquette” in the 
muμ-nuν plane, with side length aa. The gauge rotation in this case is a product of the 
rotation induced by parallel-transporting a spinor along each of the four sides of the 
plaquette in order. The parallel transport operators for each side of the plaquette are 
found from Eq. (3.26), and explicitly, their product around a plaquette is

Assuming that we are dealing with a non-Abelian ﬁeld theory, this product of expo-
nentials can be converted to a single exponential by use of the Baker-Cambell-
Haussdorf rule, which for the product of four terms takes the form

(3.29) 
where the period period period... represent higher-order terms. An arbitrary loop can be approximated 
by a tiling of small plaquettes, to yield a result proportional to the total tiled area 
multiplied by upper F Subscript mu nuFμν. Since the common edges of adjacent plaquettes are traversed in 
opposite directions the contributions along these edges are cancelled, and the entire 
tiling results in a path around the outside of the tiled area (Fig. 3.3). Such an arbitrary

Fig. 3.3 An arbitrary closed path in the plane can be approximated by tilings of plaquettes. Since 
each plaquette is traversed anti-clockwise, adjacent edges make cancelling contributions to the 
parallel transport of a spinor, leaving only the contribution at the boundary of the tiling (as illustrated 
for the plaquettes in the lower-right corner) 
loop is called a Wilson loop, and the loop holonomy associated to it is called the 
Wilson loop variable, and corresponds to an element in the gauge group of the theory. 
To obtain a single variable from the parallel transport around a loop, we take the trace 
of the loop holonomy

The Wilson loop is gauge-invariant, since each line segment of which the loop is

under a gauge transformation like that in Eq. (3.5), and so the product of several line

(3.32) 
Different gauge transformations therefore correspond with different choices of start-
ing point for the loop. However the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, 
TrABC = TrBCA = TrCAB, and so the Wilson loop variable is independent of choice 
of gauge transformation [ 2]. It is a fairly straightforward matter to see from the form 
of Eq. (3.18) that sinceupper WW is the exponential of a term proportional toupper F Subscript mu nuFμν the action 
for the gauge ﬁeld may be constructed by evaluating Wilson loops. 
This discussion shows that upper F Subscript mu nuFμν is a measure of the gauge curvature within a 
surface, as well as a measure of the loop holonomy of the loop enclosing the surface 
(that is, the gauge rotation induced on a spinor when it is parallel-transported around 
a closed loop). Hence when the connection does not vanish the associated loop 
holonomy will in general not be trivial.

Dynamics of Quantum Fields 
We will conclude this chapter with a discussion of two approaches to the dynamics of 
quantum ﬁelds. These are well-established in the case of theories like QED and QCD, 
and so it will be natural later on to consider equivalent approaches when we wish to 
quantise spacetime, which is the dynamical ﬁeld in GR. These two approaches are 
based on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. 
Lagrangian (or Path Integral) Approach 
Although our primary concern is ﬁelds, some insight can be provided by considering 
the classical case of a non-relativistic point particle in ﬂat space moving under the 
inﬂuence of an external potential upper V left parenthesis x right parenthesisV (x) for which the action is given by 
upper S Subscript pp Baseline left bracket lamda right bracket equals integral Underscript lamda Endscripts d cubed x d t left parenthesis one half m ModifyingAbove x With dot squared minus upper V left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesis equals integral Underscript lamda Endscripts d cubed x d t upper L left parenthesis x right parenthesis periodSpp[λ] =
 
λ
d3xdt

2m ˙x2 −V (x)
)
=
 
λ
d3xdt L(x).
(3.33) 
The action integral depends on the choice of the path lamdaλ taken by the particle as it 
moves between its initial to ﬁnal positions. By considering inﬁnitesimal variations of 
the path we ﬁnd that the classical behaviour of the particle corresponds to following 
a path for which the action is an extremum (generally a minimum). This amounts 
to ﬁnding the equation(s) of motion by inserting the Lagrangian upper LL into the Euler-
Lagrange equations. 
Note that in the relativistic case the potential term must be replaced by a gauge 
ﬁeld upper A Subscript muAμ in which case the action takes the form 
upper S Subscript rel Baseline left bracket lamda right bracket equals integral Underscript lamda Endscripts d cubed x d t StartFraction left parenthesis p Superscript mu Baseline plus upper A Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis left parenthesis p Subscript mu Baseline plus upper A Subscript mu Baseline right parenthesis Over m 0 EndFractionSrel[λ] =

(3.34) 
where p Superscript mupμ is the energy-momentum 4-vector of the particle and m 0m0 is its rest mass. 
This is the familiar action for a charged point particle moving under the inﬂuence of 
an external potential encoded in the Abelian gauge potential upper A Subscript muAμ. 
In the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics we assign a complex ampli-
tude 8 (or real probability in the Euclidean case) to any path lamdaλ by 
exp left brace bold i upper S left bracket lamda right bracket right brace period exp {iS[λ]} .
(3.35)
8 The reader is reminded that by performing a Wick rotation, to introduce an imaginary time param-
eter, a mapping can be established between path integrals and statistical physics. See e.g. Chap. 25 
of [ 3].

Quantum Field Theory
Fig. 3.4 The path a particle 
takes between initial and 
ﬁnal positions can be 
regarded as a series of paths 
between intermediate 
positions. Varying these 
intermediate positions leads 
to variations in the overall 
path, and the action 
associated to it 
t
t'
In contrast to the classical case we do not restrict our attention to those paths which 
correspond to extrema of the action. Instead we use this complex amplitude as 
a weighting function which allows us to calculate matrix elements for transitions 
between an arbitrary pair of initial and ﬁnal states by forming a weighted sum of all 
paths which interpolate between the two states. 
For the point-particle vertical bar q comma t right angle bracket|q, t> represents a state where the particle is localized at 
positionqq at timett. The path between initial and ﬁnal states can be broken up into a 
series of small steps by slicing up the time intervalt prime minus tt' −t, as depicted in Fig. 3.4. The 
path is varied by adjusting the positions the particle passes through at the intermediate 
timest 1t1,t 2t2, etc. just as we considered variations of the path of a particle in the classical 
case. Each variation results in an action associated to the corresponding path. The 
matrix element between states at two different times then takes the form

.
(3.36) 
The weighting factor gives higher value to the contribution from those paths which 
have an associated action close to the minimum. It is this which results in classical 
behaviour, in the appropriate limit. However the contributions of all possible paths 
must still be taken into account to accurately calculate the transitions between states. 
We now turn from considering single particles, to the path-integral approach 
to quantum ﬁeld theory. Here the basic element is the propagator (or the partition 
function when the space on which the ﬁeld is deﬁned is a Euclidean manifold) which 
allows us to calculate the probability amplitudes between pairs of initial and ﬁnal 
states of our Hilbert space. As shown in Eq. (3.18), starting with the curvature of a 
gauge ﬁeld it is possible to deﬁne an action which governs the dynamics of the gauge 
ﬁeld. Thus an analogous approach to the path integral just described for particles can 
be adopted when we wish to consider ﬁelds. In this case we do not sum over paths, 
but ﬁeld conﬁgurations in each possible history between initial and ﬁnal states,

(3.37)
in contrast to the classical view of dynamics, in which a system moves from an initial 
state to a ﬁnal state in exactly one way. Herescript upper D left bracket psi right bracketD[ψ] is an appropriate measure on the

space of allowed ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Of course, as is well known, quantum ﬁeld 
theory allows for the creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Hence 
the transition between an initial and ﬁnal state is not so straightforward as the sum 
over contributions from all possible paths a single particle could take. The notational 
simplicity of writing upper S left bracket lamda right bracketS[λ] (which emphasises the conceptual similarity between the 
dynamics of single particles, quantum ﬁelds, and as we shall soon see, spacetime 
itself) in this case conceals the presence of interaction and source terms within 
the exponential. Taylor expanding the contributions of these leads to a perturbation 
series of contributions to the overall calculation, which are identiﬁed with Feynman 
diagrams for interactions involving various numbers of incoming, outgoing, and 
intermediate states (see e.g. Sect. I.7 of [ 4], or Chap. 24 of [ 3]).
Hamiltonian Approach: Canonical Quantisation 
The alternative to the Lagrangian or path-integral approach is to study the dynamics 
of a system through its Hamiltonian. This leads to Dirac’s procedure for canonical 
(or “second”) quantisation. 9 The Hamiltonian upper HH for a dynamical system can be 
constructed from the Lagrangianupper LL by performing a Legendre transformation. Given 
a conﬁguration variable qq, which we can think of as a generalised position, and a 
corresponding generalised momentum pp deﬁned by
p equals StartFraction partial differential upper L Over partial differential ModifyingAbove q With dot EndFraction commap = ∂L
∂˙q ,
(3.38) 
then the Hamiltonian is given by 
upper H left bracket p comma q right bracket equals p ModifyingAbove q With dot minus upper L left bracket q comma ModifyingAbove q With dot right bracketH[p, q] = p ˙q −L[q, ˙q]
(3.39) 
in the case of a point particle, and generalisations of this equation for other systems. 
If we deﬁne the Poisson bracket of two functions by 
StartSet f comma g EndSet equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts left parenthesis StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential q Subscript i Baseline EndFraction StartFraction partial differential g Over partial differential p Subscript i Baseline EndFraction minus StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential p Subscript i Baseline EndFraction StartFraction partial differential g Over partial differential q Subscript i Baseline EndFraction right parenthesis { f , g} =

wheref equals f left parenthesis q comma p comma t right parenthesis f = f (q, p, t) andg equals g left parenthesis q comma p comma t right parenthesisg = g(q, p, t), then Hamilton’s equations can be written 
in the form

9 The quantisation of the motion of a particle in a classical potential is sometimes referred to as 
“ﬁrst quantisation”. This is the basis for the somewhat un-intuitive name “second quantisation” for 
quantisation extended to the potential as well.

and give the time evolution of the system. Hence, leaving the second spot in the 
brackets empty, time evolution is generated by the operator left brace upper H comma right brace{H, } which acts upon 
the generalised coordinates and momenta.
In quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory observables are replaced by oper-
ators, i.e.x right arrow ModifyingAbove x With caretx →ˆx. While operators do not necessarily commute, classical observables 
do. However the Poisson bracket of two observables will not necessarily be zero, and 
Dirac was led to postulate that in the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, 
Poisson brackets between observables should be replaced by commutation relations, 
where the scalar value of the commutator isbold i italic h over two pii times the scalar value of the equivalent 
Poisson bracket, i.e.

(3.42) 
This prescription will be central to our attempts to quantise spacetime in later sections. 
We are now ready to (at least attempt to) apply our understanding of quantum 
ﬁeld theories to the formulation of general relativity.

Expanding on Classical GR 
We now return to the discussion of general relativity. Equipped with the preceding 
discussions of both the quantisation of ﬁeld theories, and the geometrical interpreta-
tions of gauge transformations, it is time to set about formulating what will eventually 
become a theory of dynamical spacetime obeying rules adapted from quantum ﬁeld 
theory. But before we get there we must cast classical GR into a form amenable to 
quantisation. 
From classical mechanics, and the discussion in Sect. 3.4, we know that dynamics 
can be described either in the Hamiltonian or the Lagrangian frameworks. The ben-
eﬁts of a Lagrangian framework are that it provides us with a covariant perspective 
on the dynamics and connects with the path-integral approach to the quantum ﬁeld 
theory of the given system. The Hamiltonian approach, on the other hand, provides 
us with a phase space picture and access to the Schrödinger method for quantization. 
Each has its advantages and difﬁculties and thus it is prudent to be familiar with how 
both frameworks may be applied to general relativity. We will begin by discussing 
these approaches in a classical framework, and move to quantisation in Chap. 5. 
4.1
Lagrangian Approach: The Einstein-Hilbert Action 
The form of the Lagrangian, and hence the action, can be determined by requirements 
of covariance and simplicity. Out of the dynamical elements of geometry—the metric 
and the connection—we can construct a limited number of quantities which are 
invariant under coordinate transformations, hence they should have no uncontracted 
indices. These quantities must be constructed out of the Riemann curvature tensor or 
its derivatives. These possibilities are of the form:StartSet upper R comma upper R Subscript mu nu Baseline upper R Superscript mu nu Baseline comma upper R squared comma nabla Subscript mu Baseline upper R nabla Superscript mu Baseline upper R comma ellipsis EndSet{R, Rμν Rμν, R2, ∇μR∇μR, . . .}. 
The simplest of these is the Ricci scalarupper R equals upper R Subscript mu nu alpha beta Baseline g Superscript mu alpha Baseline g Superscript nu betaR = Rμναβgμαgνβ. As it turns out this term 
is sufﬁcient to fully describe Einstein’s general relativity, yielding a Lagrangian that 
is simply StartRoot negative g EndRoot upper R√−gR, where as noted in Sect. 2.3, g equals det left parenthesis g Superscript mu nu Baseline right parenthesisg = det(gμν).

μν, and the Riemann tensor is 
deﬁned in terms of the covariant derivative, the Einstein-Hilbert action is ultimately 
a function of the metric g Subscript mu nugμν and its derivatives. 
As a further aside, we will brieﬂy describe how the Lagrangian formulation allows 
us to make contact with the path-integral or sum-over-histories approach outlined 
in Sect. 3.4, and apply it to the behaviour of spacetime as a dynamical ﬁeld. In 
general, this approach involves calculating transition amplitudes with each path 
between the initial and ﬁnal states being weighted by an exponential function of 
the action associated with that path. In the case of gravity we may think of four-
dimensional spacetime as a series of spacelike hypersurfaces, normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t, corresponding to 
different times. Each complete 4-dimensional geometry consisting of a series of 3-
dimensional hypersurfaces that interpolate between the initial and ﬁnal states may 
be thought of as the generalisation of a “path”. This3 plus 13 + 1 splitting of spacetime into 
foliated three-dimensional hypersurfaces will be covered in more detail in the next 
section. To calculate the matrix-elements (as in Eq. (3.37)) for transition amplitudes 
between initial and ﬁnal states of geometry, normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t and normal upper Sigma Subscript t prime∑t' (see Fig. 4.1) we use the

While this approach is noteworthy, and ultimately leads to a very successful compu-
tational approach to quantising gravity [ 3], it is not the path we follow to formulate 
loop quantum gravity. Instead, as mentioned above, the Lagrangian formulation of 
general relativity is used as a stepping-stone to the Hamiltonian formulation. 
4.2
Hamiltonian Approach: The ADM Splitting 
Since general relativity is a theory of dynamical spacetime, we will want to describe 
the dynamics of spacetime in terms of some variables which make computations as 
tractable as possible. The Hamiltonian formulation is well suited to a wide range 
of physical systems, and the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) formalism, described 
below, allows us to apply it to general relativity. We can think of the action, Eq. (4.1), 
which is clearly written in the form of an integral of a Lagrangian, as a stepping-stone 
to this Hamiltonian approach. This Hamiltonian formulation of GR takes us to the 
close of our discussion of classical gravity, and will be used as the jumping-off point 
for the quantisation of gravity, to be undertaken in Chap. 5. 
The ADM formalism involves foliating spacetime into a set of three-dimensional 
spacelike hypersurfaces, and picking an ordering for these hypersurfaces which plays 
the role of time, so that the hypersurfaces are level surfaces of the parametertt. This is 
a necessary feature of the Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system, although 
it seems at odds with the way GR treats space and time as interchangable parts of 
spacetime. However this time direction is actually a “ﬁducial time” 3 and will turn
3 The term “ﬁducial” refers to a standard of reference, as used in surveying, or a standard established 
on a basis of faith or trust.

out not to affect the dynamics. It is essentially a parameter used as a scaffold, which 
in the absence of a metric is not directly related to the passage of time as measured 
by a clock. 
To begin, we will suppose that the 4-dimensional spacetime is embedded within 
a manifoldscript upper MM (which may bedouble struck upper R Superscript 4R4 or any other suitable manifold). Next we choose a 
local foliation 4 StartSet normal upper Sigma Subscript t Baseline comma t EndSet{∑t, t} ofscript upper MM into spacelike 3-manifolds, wherenormal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t is the 3-manifold 
corresponding to a given value of the parameter tt. We will refer to such a manifold 
as a “leaf of foliation”. The topology of the original four-dimensional spacetime is 
then normal upper Sigma times double struck upper R∑× R, while tt is a parametrization of the set of geodesics orthogonal to normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t
(c.f. Fig. 4.2). In addition at each point of a leaf we have a unit time-like vector n Superscript munμ
(with n Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline equals negative 1nμnμ = −1) which deﬁnes the normal at each point on the leaf. 
Given the full four-metric g Subscript mu nugμν on script upper MM and the vector ﬁeld n Superscript munμ the foliation is 
completely determined by the requirement that the surfaces normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t of constant “time” 
are normal to n Superscript munμ. 
The diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity implies that there is no canon-
ical choice of the time-like vector ﬁeld t Superscript mutμ which maps a point x Superscript muxμ on a leaf normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t to 
the point x Superscript prime mux'μ on the leaf normal upper Sigma Subscript t plus delta t∑t+δt, i.e. which generates time evolution of the geometry. 
This property is in fact the gauge symmetry of general relativity. It implies that we 
can choose any vector ﬁeld t Superscript mutμ as long as it is time-like. Such a vector ﬁeld can be 
projected onto the three-manifold to obtain the shift vectorupper N Superscript a Baseline equals t Subscript parallel toNa = t|| which is the part 
tangent to the surface, while the component oft Superscript mutμ normal to the three-manifold is then 
identiﬁed as the “distance between hypersufaces” and is called the lapse function 
upper N equals t Subscript up tackN = t⊥. Therefore t Superscript mutμ can be written as 
t Superscript mu Baseline equals upper N n Superscript mu Baseline plus upper N Superscript mutμ = Nnμ + N μ
(4.11) 
where, though we have written the shift as a four-vector to keep our choice of indices 
consistent, it is understood thatupper N Superscript 0 Baseline equals 0N 0 = 0 in a local basis of coordinates adapted to the 
splitting.
4 Generally one assumes that our 4-manifolds can always be foliated by a set of spacelike 3-
manifolds. For a general theory of quantum gravity the assumption of trivial topologies must be 
dropped. In the presence of topological defects in the 4-manifold, in general, there will exist inequiv-
alent foliations in the vicinity of a given defect. This distinction can be disregarded in the following 
discussion for the time being.

Now we can determine the components of the four-metric in a basis adapted to 
the splitting as follows; 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column g 00 equals 2nd Column g Subscript mu nu Baseline t Superscript mu Baseline t Superscript nu 2nd Row 1st Column equals 2nd Column g Subscript mu nu Baseline left parenthesis upper N n Superscript mu Baseline plus upper N Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis left parenthesis upper N n Superscript nu Baseline plus upper N Superscript nu Baseline right parenthesis 3rd Row 1st Column equals 2nd Column upper N squared n Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript mu plus upper N Superscript mu Baseline upper N Subscript mu plus 2 upper N left parenthesis upper N Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline right parenthesis 4th Row 1st Column equals 2nd Column minus upper N squared plus upper N Superscript mu Baseline upper N Subscript mu EndLayoutg00 = gμνtμtν

= −N 2 + N μNμ
(4.12) 
where we have used n Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline equals negative 1nμnμ = −1 and upper N Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline equals 0N μnμ = 0 in the third line. Working in a 
coordinate basis where upper N Superscript mu Baseline equals left parenthesis 0 comma upper N Superscript a Baseline right parenthesisN μ = (0, Na), the result g 00 equals minus upper N squared plus upper N Superscript a Baseline upper N Subscript ag00 = −N 2 + N a Na is found. 5
Similarly to obtain the other components of the metric we project along the time-
space and the space-space directions, 
g Subscript mu nu Baseline t Superscript mu Baseline upper N Superscript nu Baseline equals upper N Superscript mu Baseline upper N Subscript mu Baseline identical to upper N Superscript a Baseline upper N Subscript a Baseline periodgμνtμN ν = N μNμ ≡N a Na.
(4.13) 
Since, by deﬁnitiong Subscript 0 nu Baseline identical to g Subscript mu nu Baseline t Superscript mug0ν ≡gμνtμ, this implies thatg Subscript 0 a Baseline equals upper N Subscript ag0a = Na. The space-space com-
ponents of g Subscript mu nugμν are simply given by selecting values of the indices mu comma nu element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetμ, ν ∈{1, 2, 3}. 
Thus the full metric g Subscript mu nugμν can be written schematically as 
g Subscript mu nu Baseline equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column minus upper N squared plus upper N Superscript a Baseline upper N Subscript a Baseline 2nd Column bold italic upper N 2nd Row 1st Column bold italic upper N Superscript upper T Baseline 2nd Column g Subscript a b EndMatrixgμν =

the above expression, 
d s squared equals g Subscript mu nu Baseline d x Superscript mu Baseline d x Superscript nu Baseline equals left parenthesis minus upper N left parenthesis t right parenthesis squared plus upper N Superscript a Baseline upper N Subscript a Baseline right parenthesis d t squared plus 2 upper N Superscript a Baseline d t d x Subscript a Baseline plus g Subscript a b Baseline d x Superscript a Baseline d x Superscript bds2 = gμνdxμdxν = (−N(t)2 + Na Na)dt2 + 2 Nadt dxa + gabdxadxb (4.15) 
where again a comma b element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSeta, b ∈{1, 2, 3} are spatial indices on normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t. 
The componentsg Subscript a bgab of the metric restricted to a leaf of foliation are not the same 
as the intrinsic metric in a leaf of foliation. The intrinsic metric is related to the 
projection operator that takes any object upper T Subscript mu ellipsis nuTμ...ν deﬁned in the full four-dimensional 
manifold and projects out its component normal to the leafnormal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t. To understand how to 
decomposeupper T Subscript mu ellipsis nuTμ...ν into a partupper T Subscript parallel toT||, which lies only in the hypersurfacenormal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t and a partupper T Subscript up tackT⊥, 
orthogonal to normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t, we may consider a vector v Superscript muvμ. The orthogonal component is given 
by v Subscript up tack Baseline equals v Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript muv⊥= vμnμ. Similarly the component lying in normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t is obtained by projecting the 
vector along the direction of the shift, sov Subscript parallel to Baseline equals v Superscript mu Baseline upper N Subscript muv|| = vμNμ. Writing a general four-vector as 
v Superscript mu Baseline equals v Subscript up tack Baseline n Superscript mu Baseline plus v Subscript parallel to Baseline StartFraction upper N Superscript mu Baseline Over StartAbsoluteValue upper N EndAbsoluteValue EndFractionvμ = v⊥nμ + v|| Nμ
|N| (whereStartAbsoluteValue upper N EndAbsoluteValue equals upper N Superscript mu Baseline upper N Subscript mu|N| = N μNμ is the norm of the shift vector) and acting 
on it with g Subscript mu nu Baseline plus n Subscript mu Baseline n Subscript nugμν + nμnν we have 
left parenthesis g Subscript mu nu Baseline plus n Subscript mu Baseline n Subscript nu Baseline right parenthesis left parenthesis v Subscript up tack Baseline n Superscript nu Baseline plus v Subscript parallel to Baseline StartFraction upper N Superscript nu Baseline Over StartAbsoluteValue upper N EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction right parenthesis equals v Subscript up tack Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline left parenthesis 1 plus n Superscript nu Baseline n Subscript nu Baseline right parenthesis plus StartFraction v Subscript parallel to Baseline Over StartAbsoluteValue upper N EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction left parenthesis upper N Subscript mu Baseline plus n Superscript nu Baseline upper N Subscript nu Baseline right parenthesis equals v Subscript parallel to Baseline StartFraction upper N Subscript mu Baseline Over StartAbsoluteValue upper N EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction period(gμν+nμnν)

5 From this expression we can also see that g 00 equals minus upper N squared plus upper N Superscript a Baseline upper N Subscript ag00 = −N 2 + N a Na is a measure of the  local speed 
of time evolution and hence is a measure of the local gravitational energy density.

Sincen Superscript mu Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline equals negative 1nμnμ = −1, and n Superscript nu Baseline upper N Subscript nu Baseline equals 0nν Nν = 0 by deﬁnition, we are left with only the compo-
nent of v Superscript muvμ parallel to normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t. We see that h Subscript mu nu Baseline equals g Subscript mu nu Baseline plus n Subscript mu Baseline n Subscript nuhμν = gμν + nμnν is the required projection 
operator. This tensor also happens to correspond to the intrinsic three-metric on normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t, 
induced by its embedding in script upper MM, 
h Subscript a b Baseline equals g Subscript a b Baseline plus n Subscript a Baseline n Subscript b Baseline commahab = gab + nanb ,
(4.16) 
where as above a comma b element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSeta, b ∈{1, 2, 3}. The reader might wonder how a rank 3 tensor h Subscript a bhab
can be written in terms of a rank 4 objectg Subscript mu nugμν. To understand this, note that the spatial 
metric can also be written as a rank 4 tensor, 
hμν = gμν + nμnν . 
However, by construction, the time-time (.htt ) and space-time (.htx , hty, htz) compo-
nents vanish and we are left with a rank 3 object. There is no contradiction in writing 
the spatial metric with either spatial indices (.a, b, . . .) or with spacetime indices 
(.μ, ν, . . .) as its contraction with another object is non-zero if and only if that object 
has a purely spatial character. 
We have already seen how the Einstein-Hilbert action can be written in terms 
of the metric g Subscript mu nugμν and its derivatives. It makes sense, therefore, that in the case of 
general relativity, where we have foliated the spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces, 
we should take the intrinsic metric onnormal upper Sigma∑(from now on we drop thett superscript as we 
will deal with only one, representative, leaf of the foliation) as our conﬁguration or 
“position” variable. To ﬁnd the relevant Hamiltonian density we proceed in a manner 
that parallels the approach in classical mechanics or ﬁeld theory—namely we perform 
a Legendre transform to obtain the Hamiltonian function from the Lagrangian. In the 
case of classical mechanics, given a Lagrangian upper LL dependent on some coordinates 
qq, we see that 
upper H left bracket p comma q right bracket equals p ModifyingAbove q With dot minus upper L left bracket q comma ModifyingAbove q With dot right bracket w h e r e p equals StartFraction partial differential upper L Over partial differential ModifyingAbove q With dot EndFraction commaH[p, q] = p ˙q −L[q, ˙q]

Fig. 4.3 Intrinsic curvature measured by parallel transport (left), and extrinsic curvature measured 
by changes in the normal vectors (right). The cylinder in this example has no intrinsic curvature, 
the same as a ﬂat sheet, since the solid vectors carried around the closed loop are unchanged, but 
the normal vectors of the cylinder are not all parallel, indicating non-zero extrinsic curvature 
In addition to the intrinsic metric h Subscript a bhab, the hypersurfaces normal upper Sigma∑also have a tensor 
which describes their embedding inscript upper MM, as shown in Fig. 4.3. 6 This object is known 
as the extrinsic curvature, and is measured by taking the spatial projection of the 
gradient of the normal vectors to the hypersurface,

(4.20) 
where upper D Subscript aDa is now the covariant derivative operator which acts only on purely spa-
tial objects. This spatial covariant derivative operator is explored in more detail in 
Appendix D, Sect. D.1. 
As is true in the case of the intrinsic metric, contracting the extrinsic curva-
ture with any object with a time-like component gives zero, k Subscript mu nu Baseline n Superscript mu Baseline equals 0kμνnμ = 0, implying 
that the extrinsic curvature is a quantity with only spacelike indices, k Subscript a bkab. Moreover 
k Subscript a b Baseline equals k Subscript left parenthesis a b right parenthesiskab = k(ab) is a symmetric object by virtue of its construction (Sect. D.2). 
Due to the properties of the Lie derivative and the purely spatial character of 
the extrinsic curvature one can show (see Appendix E) that k Subscript a b Baseline equals pound sign Subscript n Baseline h Subscript a bkab = £nhab, i.e. the 
extrinsic curvature is the Lie derivative of the intrinsic metric with respect to the 
unit normal vector ﬁeld n Superscript ana. Now the Lie derivativepound sign Subscript v Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline upper X£→v X of an objectupper XX with respect 
to a vector ﬁeld v Superscript ava can be interpreted as the rate of change of upper XX along the integral 
curves generated byv Superscript ava. By analogy with the deﬁnition ofpp in Eq. (4.17) we might be 
tempted to identify the extrinsic curvature with the “momentum variable” conjugate 
to the “position variable” (namely the intrinsic metric). This is not far off the mark. 
As we will see the conjugate momentum will, indeed, turn out to be a function of 
k Subscript a bkab. 
The Einstein-Hilbert action can be re-written in terms of quantities deﬁned on the 
spatial hypersurfaces, by making two substitutions. Firstly, and analogously togg, we  
write hh for the determinant of h Superscript a bhab and recognise that the four-dimensional volume

however this is redundant in our present discussion.

The Gauss-Codazzi relation is a very general result which is true in an arbitrary 
number of dimensions. The reader with too much time on their hands may wish 
to derive it for themselves by using the deﬁnition of the Ricci scalar in terms of 
the Christoffel connection and using the 3-metric h Subscript nu Superscript muhμ
ν to project quantities in 3 plus 13 + 1
dimensions down to the three dimensions ofnormal upper Sigma∑. By repeating this process with objects 
living in nn and n plus 1n + 1 dimensions, one can obtain the version which applies for 
manifolds of any dimensionality nn. 
Using these substitutions, the Einstein-Hilbert action can be rewritten in a form 
that is convenient for identifying the parts which depend only on normal upper Sigma∑,

implying that script upper HH and script upper C Superscript aCa are identically zero and are thus to be interpreted as con-
straints on the phase space! This is nothing more than the usual prescription of 
Lagrange multipliers—when an action depends only on a conﬁguration variable qq
but not on the corresponding momentum pp, the terms multiplying the conﬁguration 
variable are constraints on the phase space. 
script upper C Superscript aCa and script upper HH are referred to as the vector (or diffeomorphism) constraint and the 
scalar (or Hamiltonian) constraint, respectively. Before we discuss their interpre-
tation, and the reasons for these names, notice that the Hamiltonian density in 
Eq. (4.27), obtained after performing the 3 plus 13 + 1 split of the Einstein-Hilbert action 
via the ADM procedure [ 5], is a sum of constraints, i.e. upper H Subscript EH Baseline equals upper N script upper H minus upper N Subscript a Baseline script upper C Superscript a Baseline equals 0HEH = NH −NaCa = 0. 
This is a generic feature of diffeomorphism invariant theories.

Physical Interpretation of Constraints 
We now brieﬂy describe the form of the Poisson brackets between the various con-
straints and their physical interpretation. For what follows, it will be helpful to recall

than just being deﬁned at each point ofnormal upper Sigma∑. To go from the ﬁrst line to the second we 
have integrated by parts and dropped the term which is a pure divergence. This is 
justiﬁed if the ﬁeldxi Subscript aξa has support only on a compact subset ofnormal upper Sigma∑. The constraintscript upper C Superscript aCa

ﬁrst place. 
Similarly a much more involved calculation along the lines of the one above yields 
for the Poisson bracket between a functionf f on the phase space and the “Hamiltonian 
constraint” script upper HH [ 7, Sect. I.1.1]

given time tt to functions on a hypersurface normal upper Sigma Subscript t prime∑t' at a later time t primet'. This is the reason 
for referring to script upper HH as the “Hamiltonian constraint”; it generates time evolution of 
functions on the phase space, the same way the Hamiltonian in classical or quantum 
mechanics does. 
A little later, when we cast GR in the ﬁrst order formulation we will encounter a 
third constraint, referred to as the Gauss constraint. We shall discuss the interpretation 
of the constraints again once the Gauss constraint has been properly introduced, but 
note here that the Hamiltonian constraint is relevant to the time evolution of the 
spacelike hypersurfaces, while the other two constraints act spatially (i.e. within the 
hypersurfaces). 
We do not wish to provide more details of the ADM procedure than are strictly 
necessary. Further details about the ADM splitting and canonical quantization can 
be found in [ 2] in the metric formulation, and [ 5] in the connection formulation. 8

Unfortunately the above prescription is only formal in nature and we run into 
severe difﬁculties when we try to implement this recipe. The primary obstacle is 
the fact that the Hamiltonian constraint stated in Eq. (4.28a) has a non-polynomial 
dependence on the 3-metric via the Ricci curvature Superscript left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis Baseline upper R(3)R. We can see this schemati-
cally by noting that Superscript left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis Baseline upper R(3)R is a function of the Christoffel connection normal upper Gamma┌which in turn 
is a complicated function of h Subscript a bhab: 
Superscript left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis Baseline upper R tilde left parenthesis partial differential normal upper Gamma right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis normal upper Gamma right parenthesis squared semicolon normal upper Gamma tilde q partial differential q right double arrow partial differential normal upper Gamma tilde partial differential q partial differential q plus q partial differential squared q period(3)R ∼(∂┌)2 + (┌)2 ;
┌∼q∂q ⇒∂┌∼∂q∂q + q∂2q .
(4.37) 
This complicated form of the constraints raises questions about operator ordering 
and is also very non-trivial to quantize. Therefore, in this form, the constraints of 
general relativity are not amenable to quantization. 
This is in contrast to the situation with the Maxwell and Yang-Mills ﬁelds, which 
being gauge ﬁelds can be quantized in terms of holonomies (see Sect. 3.3), which 
form a complete set of gauge-invariant variables. An optimist might believe that 
were we able to rewrite general relativity as a theory of a gauge ﬁeld, we could make 
considerably more progress towards quantization than in the metric formulation. 
This does turn out to be the case as we see in the following sections. 
4.3.1
Connection Formulation 
Our ultimate goal is to cast general relativity in the mould of gauge ﬁeld theories 
such as Maxwell or Yang-Mills. The parallel between covariant derivatives and con-
nections in GR and QFT suggests that gravity may be treated as a gauge ﬁeld theory

μν as the gauge connection. However, though the Christoffel connection is an 
afﬁne connection it does not transform as a tensor under arbitrary coordinate trans-
formations (c.f. [ 2, Chap. 4]) and thus cannot play the role of a gauge connection 
which should be a covariant quantity. 
normal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript rho┌ρ
μν allows us to parallel transport vectors v Superscript muvμ and, 9 in general, arbitrary tensors 
(vectors are of course a special case of tensors) i.e. it allows us to map the tangent 
spaceupper T Subscript pTp at pointpp to the tangent spaceupper T Subscript p primeTp' at the pointp primep'. The map depends on the 
path connectingpp andp primep' and it is this fact that allows us to measure local geometric 
properties of a manifold. However, in order to allow the parallel transport of spinors 
the Christoffel connection is not sufﬁcient. 
The Christoffel connection does not “know” about spinor ﬁelds of the form psi Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper IψμI
(whereupper II is a Lie algebra index). A theory of quantum gravity which does not know 
about fermions would not be very useful. Thus we need an alternative to the Christof-
fel connection which has both these properties; covariance with respect to coordinate 
transformations, and coupling with spinors. 
Up until now we have worked with GR in second-order form, i.e. with the metric 
g Subscript mu nugμν as the only conﬁguration variable (hence this is also called the metric formu-
lation). The Christoffel connection normal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript rho┌ρ
μν is determined by the metric compatibility 
condition, 
nabla g Subscript mu nu Baseline equals 0 period∇gμν = 0 .
(4.38) 
The passage to the quantum theory is facilitated by switching to a ﬁrst-order formula-
tion of GR (also called the connection formulation), in which both the metric and the 
connection are treated as independent conﬁguration variables. However due to the 
problems with the Christoffel connection noted above, we shall choose a ﬁrst-order 
formulation in terms of a tetrad or “frame-ﬁeld” (which we will see shortly takes the 
role of the metric) and a gauge connection (the “spin connection”), both of which 
take values in the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. In the following subsections we 
will describe the tetrads and the spin connection in some detail, before proceeding 
to our ﬁrst example of a ﬁrst-order formulation of gravity, the Palatini formulation. 
The connection formulation exposes a hidden symmetry of geometry as illustrated 
by the following analogy. The introduction of spinors in quantum mechanics (and 
the corresponding Dirac equation) allows us to express a scalar ﬁeld phi left parenthesis x right parenthesisφ(x) as the 
“square” of a spinor phi equals normal upper Psi Superscript i Baseline normal upper Psi Subscript iφ = 𝚿i𝚿i. In a similar manner the use of the tetrads allows 
us to write the metric as a square g Subscript mu nu Baseline equals e Subscript mu Superscript upper I Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript upper J Baseline eta Subscript upper I upper Jgμν = eI

4.3.2
Tetrads 
We begin by considering the four dimensional manifoldscript upper MM, introduced in Sect. 4.2, 
above. As we know, any sufﬁciently small region of a curved manifold will look 
ﬂat 10 and so we may deﬁne a tangent space to any point upper PP in script upper MM. Such a tangent 
space will be a ﬂat Minkowski spacetime, and the point upper PP may be regarded as part 
of the worldline of an observer, without loss of generality. This tangent space will be 
spanned by four vectors,e Subscript mueμ. Each basis vector will have four components,e Subscript mu Superscript upper IeI
μ where 
upper I element of StartSet 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetI ∈{0, 1, 2, 3}, referred to the locally-deﬁned reference frame (the “laboratory 
frame” of the observer who’s worldline passes through upper PP, with lengths and angles 
measured using the Minkowski metric). 11 As noted back in Chap. 1, such a set of four 
basis vectors is referred to as a tetrad or vierbein (German for “four legs”). 12 Since 
the tetrads live in Minkowski space, their dot product is taken using the Minkowski 
metric. But the dot product of basis vectors is just the metric itself, so the metric of 
script upper MM at any point is just given by 
g Subscript mu nu Baseline equals e Subscript mu Superscript upper I Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript upper J Baseline eta Subscript upper I upper Jgμν = eI

where eta Subscript upper I upper J Baseline equals d i a g left parenthesis negative 1 comma plus 1 comma plus 1 comma plus 1 right parenthesisηI J = diag(−1, +1, +1, +1) is the Minkowski metric. Taking the determi-
nant of both sides we ﬁnd that 
det left parenthesis g Subscript mu nu Baseline right parenthesis equals det left parenthesis eta Subscript upper I upper J Baseline right parenthesis det left parenthesis e Subscript mu Superscript upper I Baseline right parenthesis squared equals minus det left parenthesis e Subscript mu Superscript upper I Baseline right parenthesis squareddet(gμν) = det(IJ)det(eI

therefore e equals StartRoot negative g EndRoot ∴e = √−g
(4.42b) 
whereg identical to det left parenthesis g Subscript mu nu Baseline right parenthesisg ≡det(gμν) ande identical to det left parenthesis e Subscript mu Superscript upper I Baseline right parenthesise ≡det(eI
μ). Due to this fact the tetrad can be thought of as 
the “square-root” of the metric. 
Tetrads can thus be interpreted as the transformation matrices that map between 
two sets of coordinates, as can be seen by comparing Eq. (4.41) with the standard 
form for a coordinate transformation, Eq. (2.16). It is this fact which makes the tetrads 
a useful tool in modern formulations of GR. Since the components of spinors are 
deﬁned relative to the ﬂat “laboratory frame” of the tangent space, and tetrads map
10 So long as the manifold is continuous, not discrete. This is an important point to keep in mind 
for later. 
11 The components can be regarded a internal to the “laboratory frame” tangent space, and hence 
the choice of indicesupper I comma upper J ellipsisI, J . . . is appropriate. 
12 The similar word vielbein (“any legs”) is used for the generalisation of this concept to an arbitrary 
number of dimensions (e.g. triads, pentads).

the metric of this tangent space to the metric of the full four-dimensional spacetime, 
they serve the role we mentioned above, of allowing us to construct a connection 
that knows about spinor quantities as well as vectors and tensors. The construction 
of such a connection will be described below.

4.3.3
Choosing a Gauge Group 
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a student in possession of a basic familiar-
ity with loop quantum gravity will be in want of an explanation of the signiﬁcance of 
SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C). If we wish to construct a theory that encompasses GR under the framework 
of gauge ﬁeld theories we should anticipate that the local symmetries of spacetime 
will deﬁne the gauge group of our quantum gravity theory. To give one example, BF 
theory (discussed in Sect. 7.2) in three dimensions contains (2+1) general relativity, 
where choosing SOleft parenthesis 3 right parenthesis(3) results in a Riemannian metric, 13 while choosing SO(2,1) 
results in a Lorentzian one. 
We have seen already that gauge ﬁeld theories are constructed by promoting 
global gauge symmetries to local symmetries, giving rise to gauge ﬁelds which 
manifest as connection terms in the covariant derivative. The reader will recall from 
the start of Chap. 2 that special relativity is formulated in a ﬂat spacetime, and 
hence any transformation of the coordinates applies globally, while GR describes 
curved spacetime, with SR applying in any sufﬁciently small region 14 and mappings 
between coordinate choices in widely-separated regions accounting for the spacetime 
curvature. In other words, we expect the symmetries of SR to carry over to GR but to 
be locally applicable, rather than global, and hence expect the existence of a covariant 
derivative with a connection term. We will discuss the choice of gauge group of this 
connection term using both a conceptual argument, and a more precise mathematical 
formulation. 
Both arguments involve recognising that rotations in spacetime can be mapped 
to SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) transformations. As noted in Chap. 2 the causal structure of spacetime 
deﬁnes a future light-cone and past light-cone at each event. The past light-cone of
13 A Riemannian metric by deﬁnition always assigns lengths greater than zero to distinct points in 
a manifold. This is in contrast to the Minkowski metric, which as per footnote 2 of Chap. 2, may  
not. 
14 In constructing a theory of quantum gravity we may ﬁnd that this is not strictly true, as spacetime 
may not be viably treated as continuous at all length scales, and in fact the concept of a background 
spacetime may not be valid at all. But these are subtleties to dwell upon in the latter parts of this 
book. For now, we’ll focus on classical theories of spacetime structure.

an observer at any given value of time is the celestial sphere at a ﬁxed distance from 
the observer. The celestial sphere can be parametrised by the angles thetaθ, phiφ, and any 
point on a sphere can be stereographically projected onto a plane. For our purposes, 
this shall be taken to be the complex plane, so that any point on the celestial sphere 
corresponds with a complex number zeta equals upper X plus i upper Yζ = X + iY . We can write this as the ratio of 
two complex numberszeta equals chi divided by upsilonζ = χ/υ. This may seem like an odd thing to do, exchanging 
one complex number for two, but if we write chiχ and upsilonυ as the components of a 2-
vector it allows us to let zetaζ become inﬁnite or zero (corresponding to stereographic 
projection of the “north pole” and “south pole” of the celestial sphere) by acting on 
this 2-vector with a transformation that has a ﬁnite determinant (and hence keeps the 
magnitudes of both chiχ and upsilonυ within a ﬁnite range). Such a linear transformation can 
be written in the form of a2 times 22 × 2 matrix with complex components. We can of course 
write chiχ and upsilonυ as functions of thetaθ and phiφ, and vice-versa. So a change of the complex 
coordinates is equivalent to a coordinate transformation of the real angles thetaθ, phiφ. If  
we take the determinant of this transformation matrix to be +1 (which we can do, 
without loss of generality) this is an SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) transformation. Thus SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) is the 
local gauge group of special relativity. 
To state this result more precisely, we recognise that the Lorentz group is generated 
by three rotations, denotedupper J Subscript aJa, and three boosts—which we may think of as rotations 
in the planes deﬁned by the time direction and a spatial direction—denoted upper K Subscript aKa.

Since the Pauli matrices are traceless 2 times 22 × 2 matrices, the upper J Subscript aJa and upper K Subscript aKa will generate 
(via exponentiation, as usual) a group of2 times 22 × 2 matrices with complex entries, having 
determinant plus 1+1. The group SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) consists of such matrices, and has six inde-
pendent parameters, which we can identify with the magnitudes of the rotations and 
boosts.

These are simply the commutation relations of the Lorentz Lie algebra. Thus the

The reader should recognise from Eqs. (4.45) and (4.46), that while the commu-
tators of the rotations are linear combinations of rotations, so are the commutators of 
the boosts. In other words, the boosts are not closed under commutation. However

hence both the upper N Superscript plusN + and upper N Superscript minusN −independently act like generators of SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2), and we 
conclude that the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is equivalent to two copies of the 
Lie algebraGerman s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesissu(2). This leads in a well-known manner to classifying representations 
(Sect. A.1) of the Lorentz group by pairs of eigenvalues. With upper J Subscript aJa and upper K Subscript aKa chosen as 
per Eq. (4.44) we ﬁnd that upper N Subscript a Superscript plus Baseline equals 0N +

a = 1
2σa and upper N Subscript a Superscript minus Baseline equals 0N −
a = 0 yielding the 
left parenthesis 1 divided by 2 comma 0 right parenthesis(1/2, 0) representation, which acts on left-handed spinors. Note that having one 
or both generators equal to zero is perfectly acceptable, as exponentiation of zero 
yields 11, the sole element of the trivial group. Indeed the simplest representation of 
the Lorentz group is the trivial representation, with all group elements equal to 1. It 
acts upon Lorentz scalars (since these don’t change under a Lorentz transformation 
i.e. are multiplied by 1). The eigenvalues of upper N Superscript plus Baseline equals 0N + = 0 and upper N Superscript minus Baseline equals 0N −= 0 are both zero, so 
we refer to this as theleft parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0) representation. Naturally the commutation relations are 
fulﬁlled since left bracket 0 comma 0 right bracket equals 0[0, 0] = 0. 
But let us return to the matter at hand. Just as a pair of real scalars may be identiﬁed 
with a complex scalar, we may identify German s l left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesissl(2, C) as the complexiﬁcation of German s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesissu(2). 
Without getting bogged down in details, the take-home message is that SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) is 
found to be the universal covering group of the Lorentz group. 15 This should sound 
familiar to physicists—the well-known fact that SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) is a double-cover of SOleft parenthesis 3 right parenthesis(3)
is another example of such a relationship. 
With the correspondence between the Lorentz group andSL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) established we 
can go on to think about what this means for transformations of spinors. The Lorentz 
group is a subgroup of the Poincaré group, which consists of translations in addition 
to the rotations and boosts we have just considered. Dynamics on a ﬂat spacetime 
can be described by the Poincaré group, however in a general curved spacetime 
such as we would expect in GR, translational symmetry is broken and only local 
Lorentz invariance remains as an unbroken symmetry. As discussed in Sect. 2.1 the 
mapping between local coordinate bases is encoded in the connection. However 
the Christoffel connection does not allow for the parallel transport of spinors. It is 
therefore not suitable to be used in constructing a theory of quantum gravity. The 
simplest candidate that allows for parallel transport of spinors is an German s l left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesissl(2, C) valued 
connectionupper A Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper I upper JAμI J. Such a choice of connection is a logical candidate for casting GR 
as a gauge theory, and will be referred to as a spin connection.
15 It should be borne in mind that the isomorphism is between the algebras, not the groups. The 
group SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2), with its relationship to rotations, is compact. This reﬂects the fact that rotating an 
object through a ﬁnite number of ﬁnite rotations can return it to its starting orientation. However 
the Lorentz group is non-compact, reﬂecting the fact that even an arbitrarily-large number of ﬁnite 
boosts cannot accelerate an object to the speed of light, and so boosts may be parametrised by a 
“rapidity” which takes values between negative and positive inﬁnity.

Spin Connection 
In order to be able to parallel transport objects with spinorial indices we need a 
suitable extension of the notion of a covariant derivative which acts on vectors to 
one which acts on spinors (we follow [ 8, Appendix B]). The condition for parallel 
transport of a vector is that its covariant derivative with respect to the Christoffel 
connection should vanish, i.e.

The term “spin connection” may cause some confusion, by tricking newcomers 
into thinking they have to learn a new concept, when it fact this is nothing more than 
the notion of parallel transport of a particle along a Wilson line.

In the deﬁnition of script upper DD we have included the Christoffel connection. Ideally, in 
a gauge theory of gravity, we would not want any dependence on the spacetime

Next we consider the curvature tensors for the Christoffel and the spin connections

The Palatini approach to GR starts with this action and treats the metric and the 
connection as independent dynamical variables. Variation of the action with respect 
to the metric yields the vacuum ﬁeld equationsupper R Subscript mu nu Baseline equals 0Rμν = 0, while variation with respect 
to the connection implies that the connection is the Christoffel connection. Discussion 
of the Palatini approach in terms of the metric and Christoffel connection can be found 
in many textbooks (see e.g. [ 2, Appendix E]). 
Having gone to the effort of deﬁning tetrads and the spin connection we now wish 
to write the action for GR in terms of these variables. We saw in Sect. 4.1 that require-
ments of covariance and simplicity dictated the form of the action for GR. Similarly 
our construction of an action based on tetrads and the spin connection is guided by 
physical considerations. Firstly we want the action to be diffeomorphism invariant. 
We also require the Lagrangian density to be a four-form, which we can integrate 
over a four-dimensional spacetime to give a scalar (thus this action is valid only in 
four dimensions). The curvature of the connection is already a two-form, so (sup-
pressing spacetime indices for simplicity) we include e Superscript upper I Baseline and e Superscript upper J Baseline identical to e Subscript left bracket mu Baseline Superscript upper I e Subscript nu right bracket Baseline Superscript upper JeI ∧eJ ≡e[μIeν] J, which is 
a two-form. 16 This yields the Palatini action, the simplest diffeomorphism-invariant 
action one can construct using tetrads and the curvature of the gauge connection. 
We emphasise that this is not simply upper S Subscript EHSEH rewritten with a change of variables, but 
a parallel construction. The discussion above is intended to describe the physical 
intuition behind this construction. It is conventional to use the notation upper F Subscript mu nu Superscript upper I upper JF I J

curvature of the spin connection, to yield

therefore in this approach the metric compatibility condition Eq. (4.38) arises as the 
equation of motion obtained by varying the action with respect to the connection. 
Our derivation of Eq. (4.67a) utilized thatupper F left bracket omega plus delta omega right bracket equals upper F left bracket omega right bracket plus script upper D Subscript left bracket omega right bracket Baseline left parenthesis delta omega right parenthesisF[ω + δω] = F[ω] + D[ω](δω), where 
script upper D Subscript left bracket omega right bracketD[ω] is the covariant derivative deﬁned with respect to the unperturbed connectionomegaω
as in Eq. (4.55). The resulting equation of motion, Eq. (4.67a), is then the torsion-free 
or metric-compatibility condition which tells us that the tetrad is parallel transported 
by the connection omegaω. This then implies that Eq. (4.63) holds, i.e. upper F Subscript mu nu Baseline Superscript upper I upper J Baseline identical to upper R Subscript mu nu Baseline Superscript upper I upper JFμν I J ≡Rμν I J. 
The second equation of motion can be obtained by inspection, since upper FF does not 
depend on the tetrad. Already we see dramatic technical simpliﬁcation compared 
to when we had to vary the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to the metric as in 
Eq. (4.2). 
We will digress at this point, much as we did in Sect. 4.1, in order to show that 
Eq. (4.67b) is equivalent to Einstein’s vacuum equations. We ﬁrst note that the volume

In the ﬁrst step we have used the result in Eq. (4.70). In the second step we have 
used the fact that the contraction of two epsilonϵ tensors can be written in terms of anti-
symmetrized products of Kronecker deltas. In the third and fourth steps we have 
simply contracted some indices using the Kronecker deltas and expanded the anti-
symmetrized product explicitly. In the ﬁfth and sixth steps we have made use of 
Eq. (4.61) and the deﬁnition of the Ricci tensor as the trace of the Riemann tensor: 
upper R Subscript beta Baseline Superscript mu Baseline equals upper R Subscript alpha beta Baseline Superscript alpha muRβμ = Rαβαμ. Contracting the last line of the above withe Superscript nu upper IeνI and using the fact that

Thus the tetradic action in the ﬁrst-order formulation—where the connection and 
tetrad are independent variables—is completely equivalent to classical general rela-
tivity. 
4.3.6
Palatini Hamiltonian and Constraints 
Up to this point we have been discussing classical approaches to GR. The Palatini and 
ADM approaches reproduce Einstein’s original formulation of GR, but as mentioned 
in Sect. 4.3, one would hope that they provide a formulation amenable to canonical 
quantisation. We can perform a 3 plus 13 + 1 split of the Palatini action, Eq. (4.65) and 
obtain a Hamiltonian which, once again, is a sum of constraints. However, while the 
resulting formulation appears simpler than that in terms of the metric variables, there 
are some second class constraints which when solved [ 8, Sect. 2.4] yield the same 
set of constraints as obtained in the ADM framework. Thus, the Palatini approach 
does not appear to yield any substantial improvements over the ADM version as far 
as canonical quantization is concerned. To proceed to a quantum theory, we must 
transition to a description of gravity in terms of the Ashtekar variables. But ﬁrst, let 
us brieﬂy review the ADM splitting in the tetrad formalism. For this purpose there 
are two approaches. 
The ﬁrst approach involves repeating the steps in Sect. 4.2, but this time with 
the ﬁrst order action (4.65) (where the dynamical variables are the tetrad and the 
connection), rather than with the Einstein-Hilbert action (4.64). This method is quite 
tedious and is summarized in Appendix F. Here we present a more direct approach 
due to Thiemann [ 7, Sect. I.1.3]. 
Thiemann’s approach is quite simple. It involves starting with the ADM con-
straints in the metric formulation and rewriting functions of the 3-metric h Subscript a bhab and 
3-momentum pi Subscript a bπab in terms of the tetrad e Subscript a Superscript je j
a and the extrinsic curvature one-form

a, but  
the 3-metric h Subscript a bhab remains invariant. Thus, in the tetrad formalism, the action of the 
rotation group introduces three new degrees of freedom, 17 which were not present 
in the metric formulation. These extra degrees of freedom can be eliminated by 
introducing the extrinsic curvature one-form, 
upper K Subscript a Superscript i Baseline equals upper K Subscript a b Baseline e Subscript b Superscript i Baseline commaK i

(4.73) 
where upper K Subscript a bKab is the extrinsic curvature (4.20) of the 3-manifold normal upper Sigma∑. This equation can 
be inverted to give

Since upper K Subscript a bKab is symmetric, the following constraint on upper K Subscript a Superscript iK i

As discussed in the previous section, we wish to attempt to canonically quantise GR,
which means turning the Hamiltonian, diffeomorphism and Gauss constraints into
operators and replacing Poisson brackets with commutation relations. This proce-
dure is easier said than done, however. In a practical sense one must be careful with
the ordering of operators, and hence constructing appropriate commutation relations
is not as easy as one might at ﬁrst hope. We shall discuss the way forward in outline,
before turning to a more detailed discussion of each step. Firstly we simplify the
constraints by adopting a complex-valued form for the connection and tetrad vari-
ables. These are the Ashtekar variables. Next one performs a .3
1 decomposition
to obtain the Einstein-Hilbert-Ashtekar (EHA) Hamiltonian .

to be a sum of constraints. We have already seen that these constraints all equal zero,

does admit a choice built from objects we are already familiar
with—Wilson loops. These loops are then allowed to intersect, to yield area and vol-
ume operators of the spacetime. As a result, the states of quantum spacetime come to
be represented by graphs whose edges are labelled by representations of the gauge
group (for GR this is SU.(2)). Throughout, the notion of background independence,1
which is central to general relativity, is considered sacrosanct.
The reader interested in the history behind the canonical quantization program,
with further mathematical details, is referred to [1].
1 It is important to mention one aspect of background independence that is not implemented, a priori,
in the LQG framework. This is the question of the topological degrees of freedom of geometry. On
general grounds, one would expect any four dimensional theory of quantum gravity to contain non-
trivial topological excitations at the quantum level. Classically, these excitations would correspond
to defects which would lead to deviations from smoothness of any coarse-grained geometry.

Ashtekar Formulation:“New Variables”for General
Relativity
We have already discussed the ﬁrst-order form of GR above. Now let us turn our
attention to Ashtekar’s complex-valued version of this formalism. We begin with
tetradic GR whose action is written in the Palatini form. This action is equivalent to
the usual Einstein-Hilbert action on-shell, i.e. for conﬁgurations which satisfy Ein-
stein’s ﬁeld equations, as shown in Sect.4.3.5. For dealing with spinors, a formalism
deﬁned in terms of connections and tetrads is more useful than one deﬁned in terms
of the metric, as shown above. When we perform the ADM splitting of the Palatini
action, we switch from variables deﬁned in the full four-dimensional spacetime to
the three-dimensional hypersurfacesnormal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t. Hence the tetrads at each point become “tri-
ads”,e Subscript mu Superscript upper I Baseline right arrow e Subscript a Superscript ieI
μ →ei
a wheremu right arrow a element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetμ →a ∈{1, 2, 3},upper I right arrow i element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetI →i ∈{1, 2, 3}, and the spin connection
is likewise restricted, to become normal upper Gamma Subscript a Superscript i Baseline equals omega Subscript a j k Baseline epsilon Superscript j k i┌i
a = ωajkϵ jki. The phase space variables of the
Palatini picture left parenthesis e Subscript a Superscript i Baseline comma normal upper Gamma Subscript a Superscript i Baseline right parenthesis(ei
a, ┌i
a) are the intrinsic metric of the spacelike manifold normal upper Sigma∑and a
function of its extrinsic curvature respectively, similarly to the situation we noted in
Sect.4.2. Unfortunately in this case the Hamiltonian constraint (Eq. (4.80c)) is still
a complicated non-polynomial function and canonical quantization does not appear
to be any easier in this formalism.
Ashtekar made the remarkable observation that the form of the constraints simpli-
ﬁes dramatically2 if instead of the real connectionomega Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper I upper JωμI J one works with a complex,
self-/anti-self-dual connection (this means that the connection is equal to plus or minus 1±1 times
the dual connection, which is deﬁned in an analogous manner to the dual ﬁeld strength
of Eq. (3.22)). At the heart of the formulation of general relativity as a gauge the-
ory lies a canonical transformation from the triad and connection to the “new” or
Ashtekar variables,

Both upper A Subscript a Superscript iAi
a and upper E overTilde Subscript i Superscript a ˜Ea
i admit SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) rotations with respect to the internal indices (and
hence the choice of densitised triads is non-unique). We can therefore treat the
Ashtekar formulation of gravity as an SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) gauge theory. This is consistent with
our previous discussion about the choice of gauge group for gravity (Sect.4.3.3), as

Ashtekar Formulation:“New Variables”for General Relativity

Comparing these to the form of the Palatini constraints (4.80a), we see that the
Gauss constraint now takes the form of a net divergence of the triad “electric” ﬁeld,
in analogy with the form of the Gauss law in electromagnetism. The diffeomorphism
constraint is now linear in the triad ﬁeld. The greatest simpliﬁcation is seen in the
Hamiltonian constraint which is now only quadratic in the triad, whereas previously,
due to the presence of the 1 divided by det left parenthesis q right parenthesis1/ det(q) term, it had a non-polynomial dependence on
the triad. This makes quantisation feasible. In fact [3], it turns out that the exponen-
tial of the Chern-Simons invariant on the manifold is an exact solution of all three
constraints! (See Appendix G for more details.)
The phase space conﬁguration and momentum variables are upper E overTilde Subscript i Superscript a ˜Ea
i and the spa-
tial connection upper A Superscript i Baseline Subscript aAi a. The second class constraints which were present in the Palatini
frameworkmustnowvanishduetotheBianchiidentity(see[4,Sect.2.4–2.5])andthe
diffeomorphism constraint becomes a polynomial quadratic function of the momen-
tum variables—in this case the triad. We thereby obtain a form for the constraints
which is polynomial in the coordinates and momenta and thus amenable to methods
of quantization used for quantizing gauge theories such as Yang-Mills. The resulting
expression for the Einstein-Hilbert-Ashtekar Hamiltonian of GR is
script upper H Subscript EHA Baseline equals upper N Superscript a Baseline script upper C Subscript a Baseline plus upper N script upper H plus upper T Superscript i Baseline script upper G Subscript i Baseline equals 0HEHA = N aCa + NH + T iGi = 0
(5.3)
where script upper C Subscript aCa, script upper HH and script upper G Subscript iGi are the vector, scalar and Gauss constraints respectively. The
terms upper N Subscript i Superscript aNa
i and upper NN are the shift and lapse, while upper T Superscript iT i is a lie-algebra valued function
over our spatial surface which encodes the freedom we have in choosing the gauge
for the gauge connection. As in Sect.4.2.1 we can calculate the Poisson brackets
between these constraints and the canonical variables. Doing so veriﬁes the intuition
gained from Sect.4.2.1. The Poisson brackets of a function f f with the Hamiltonian
and diffeomorphism constraints gives
StartSet f comma script upper H EndSet equals pound sign Subscript upper N n Sub Superscript right arrow Subscript Baseline f comma StartSet f comma xi Superscript a Baseline script upper C Subscript a Baseline EndSet equals pound sign Subscript xi Sub Superscript right arrow Subscript Baseline f comma{ f , H} = £N →n f ,
{ f , ξaCa} = £→ξ f ,
(5.4)
implying that as expected script upper HH and script upper C Subscript aCa generate time-evolution and spatial diffeomor-
phism respectively. Introducing the gauge degrees of freedom has also led to the
introduction of a third constraint script upper G Subscript iGi, for whose Poisson bracket we have
StartSet f comma upper T Superscript i Baseline script upper G Subscript i Baseline EndSet equals minus upper E overTilde Subscript i Superscript a Baseline upper D Subscript a Baseline upper T Superscript i Baseline comma{ f , T iGi} = −˜Ea
i DaT i ,
(5.5)
implying that script upper G Subscript iGi corresponds to the generators of gauge rotations.
It is instructive to compare the above form of the constraints to their metric
counterparts in Eq. (4.28) which are reproduced below for the reader’s convenience:

is also not too far from the original theory and can be derived from an action. That this
is the case was shown independently by Jacobson and Smolin [5] and by Samuel [6].
They completed the analysis by writing down the Lagrangian from which Ashtekar’s

While this leads to simpliﬁcation of the constraints, the presence of the unit imaginary

obtain physical results—corresponding to a metric valued indouble struck upper RR instead of indouble struck upper CC—we
must impose some restrictions on the possible solutions of the theory. If we use the
notation upper X Superscript bulletX• to represent the time derivative of upper XX, then solutions must satisfy not
only the constraints (5.2a)–(5.2c), but also the so-called “reality conditions”,

The ﬁrst of these is simply the requirement that the metric constructed from the triad
ﬁeld be real. The second says that the metric should remain real under time evolution.

3 The transformation to new variables, as implemented by most authors, including Barbero and
Immirzi, does not involve changing the triad. In this case the Poisson brackets between the new
variables picks up a factor ofgammaγ. However if we transform the triad also, as is done here following
[1], the factor ofgammaγ cancels out when taking the Poisson brackets.

where gammaγ, the so-called “Barbero-Immirzi” parameter (often referred to as just the
Immirzi parameter), is an arbitrary complex number with a signiﬁcant physical inter-
pretation. It is related to the size of a quantum of area, measured in Planck units, and
thus to the area operators mentioned in this chapter’s introduction [10, Sect.6.6.2].
For the particular choice of gamma equals bold iγ = i, the above variables reduce to Ashtekar’s original
form. For any other choice of gammaγ, however, the resulting variables are just as valid
because the transformation remains canonical, i.e. the Poisson brackets before and
after the transformation continue to remain the same, namely

(5.10)
The Barbero-Immirzi parameter, and constraining its possible values, has been
an area of active discussion in the (loop and allied) quantum gravity community for
some time. Speciﬁc topics of discussion include determining its value from compar-
ison with the calculation of the Bekenstein-Hawking gravity of a black hole [11–17],
four-fermion interactions sourced by non-zero value of gammaγ [18–20], effects of renor-
malization on values ofgammaγ [15,21], possible relationship to the Standard Model [22],
its role in obtaining a generalization of the Kodama state (Appendix G) which over-
comes difﬁculties ﬁrst pointed out by Witten [23–25], its role in determining the
strength of topological interactions in LQG of the sort encountered in the Peccei-
Quinn mechanism of the Standard Model [26–29], and more recently a possible
holographic interpretation of gammaγ [30,31]. This list is not meant to be exhaustive and
any errors and emissions of signiﬁcant contributions related togammaγ are solely the result
of the authors’ ignorance.
5.3
To Be or Not to Be (Real)
Before proceeding to the details of the quantization procedure let us address the
controversy over which is preferable, real variables or complex ones. The reality of
the Ashtekar variables depends on the reality of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter—ifgammaγ
is complex (or real), then so are the Ashtekar variables. We have chosen to introduce
the complex variables for historical reasons, and because the self-dual variables
have great pedagogical value for explaining the steps leading to the simpliﬁed form
of the ADM constraints. However the newcomer to LQG (at whom this book is
aimed) should be aware that the choice between real or complex variables is not
immediately obvious. Over time conventional wisdom has favored the real variables,
primarily because they allow us to construct the kinematical Hilbert space of SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2)
spin networks, and some may question the need to discuss the complex variables
in any great detail in an introductory review. But it is worth noting that in recent
years self-dual variables have made something of a comeback in works by Wieland,
Frodden et al., and Pranzetti. Each choice has its pros and cons.
The advantage of using a real value forgammaγ is that the new variables and the resulting
constraints remain real, avoiding the need to impose reality conditions (5.8) on solu-
tions of the constraints. Secondly, a realgammaγ avoids difﬁculties that arise when moving
to the quantum theory—since withgamma equals bold iγ = i, the gauge group of the theory isSL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C),

64

which is non-compact and it is not clearly understood how to perform integration
over non-compact groups.
The disadvantage of a real value forgammaγ is that the form of the Hamiltonian constraint
is no longer as simple as given in (5.2c), and picks up another term quadratic in both
the triad and extrinsic curvature,
script upper H equals epsilon Superscript i j Baseline Subscript k upper E overTilde Subscript i Superscript a Baseline upper E overTilde Subscript j Superscript b Baseline upper F Superscript k Baseline Subscript a b Baseline minus 2 left parenthesis 1 plus gamma squared right parenthesis upper E overTilde Subscript i Superscript left bracket a Baseline upper E overTilde Subscript j Superscript b right bracket Baseline upper K Subscript a Superscript i Baseline upper K Subscript b Superscript j Baseline almost equals 0 periodH = ϵi j k ˜Ea

b ≈0.
(5.11)
In contrast we can see that whengamma equals bold iγ = i, the second term in the above vanishes and
we are left with the usual Ashtekar form of the constraint.
A complex value ofgammaγ implies that the spectrum of the area operator (to be studied
in greater detail in Sect.6.3) will also contain complex eigenvalues. It is not clear
what physical interpretation one can assign to complex areas or complex volumes.
Moreover the structure of the kinematical Hilbert space of LQG (to be discussed
later in Chap.6) is understood only for the case of realgammaγ. Ifgammaγ is taken to be complex
then the entire technology of spin networks—using which, for instance, the black
hole entropy calculation (Sect.8.1) is performed—is rendered unusable.
On the other hand, retaining a complex gammaγ means that the spatial connection has
an interpretation as a spacetime connection since it transforms correctly under dif-
feomorphisms [6,32,33], whereas this is not true for the real or “Ashtekar-Barbero”
connection. The Hamiltonian constraint is polynomial which is one of the principle
motivations and advantages for going from metric dynamics to connection dynamics.
Wieland [34,35] has shown that starting from the complex variables (with
SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) as gauge group) one can perform the canonical quantization procedure
and obtain the same kinematic Hilbert space as in the SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) case. Thus the earlier
concerns regarding the viability of complex variables vis-a-vis the existence of the
kinematical Hilbert space would appear to have been resolved.
Frodden, Perez, and Ghosh [36] have shown that when the dimension of the
Hilbert space of SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) Chern-Simons gauge theory, which describes the dynamics
of a quantum isolated horizon (QIH) [37,38], is analytically continued to complex
values, its asymptotic behavior has an exponential dependence on the horizon area.
In this way the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is recovered in the semiclassical limit.
Pranzetti [39] has demonstrated that in order to provide a geometrical notion
of the temperature of a QIH one must work with a complex value of the Barbero-
Immirzi parameter. Taking gamma equals bold iγ = i and requiring that the horizon state satisfying the
QIH boundary condition be a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state (i.e. a thermal
equilibrium state) leads to the formula for the temperature of the horizon. The Boltz-
mann and von-Neumann entropies can also be calculated and in the semi-classical
limit both yield the expression for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
With these observations in hand, it is certainly too soon to consign the complex
variables to being merely a historical footnote in the development of LQG.

5.5
Canonical Quantization
65
5.4
Loop Quantization
As noted above, the program of loop quantum gravity involves the following steps:
1. Write GR in connection and tetrad variables (in ﬁrst order form).
2. Perform a3 plus 13 + 1 decomposition to obtain the Einstein-Hilbert-Ashtekar Hamilto-
nian script upper H Subscript EHAHEHA which turns out to be a sum of constraints.
3. Obtain a quantized version of the Hamiltonian whose action on elements of the
physical space of states yields script upper H Subscript EHA Baseline vertical bar normal upper Psi right angle bracket equals 0HEHA|𝚿> = 0.
4. Identify an appropriate basis for the physical states of spacetime.
The ﬁrst two steps have been thoroughly covered. So now, after a fairly lengthy
digression, we are ready to return to the task mentioned in Sect.4.3, rewriting the
constraints in operator form, and identifying the physical states of quantum gravity.
The ﬁrst part of this process was completed in Eqs. (5.2a)–(5.2c).
Thefollowingexpositiononlygivesusabird’seyeviewoftheprocessofcanonical
quantization. The reader interested in the mathematical details of and the history
behind the canonical quantization program is referred to [1].
5.5
Canonical Quantization
To ﬁnd solutions of the equations of motion we want to ﬁnd states normal upper Psi left bracket upper A right bracket𝚿[A] such that
they are acted upon appropriately by the constraints. This means that they satisfy
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column ModifyingAbove script upper H With caret vertical bar normal upper Psi right angle bracket 2nd Column equals 3rd Column 0 2nd Row 1st Column ModifyingAbove script upper C With caret Subscript a Baseline vertical bar normal upper Psi right angle bracket 2nd Column equals 3rd Column 0 3rd Row 1st Column ModifyingAbove script upper G With caret Subscript i Baseline vertical bar normal upper Psi right angle bracket 2nd Column equals 3rd Column 0 EndLayout ˆH|𝚿> = 0
ˆCa|𝚿> = 0
ˆGi|𝚿> = 0
The Gauss constraint tells us that normal upper Psi left bracket upper A right bracket𝚿[A] should be gauge-invariant functions of the
connection. The diffeomorphism constraint is telling us that normal upper Psi left bracket upper A right bracket𝚿[A] should be invari-
ant under diffeomorphisms of the paths along which the connection lies. These
constraints taken together do not impose a particular choice of normal upper Psi left bracket upper A right bracket𝚿[A] upon us, but
they do admit Wilson loops as one possible, and particularly convenient, choice.
Let us consider solutions of the form normal upper Psi left bracket upper A right bracket equals sigma summation Underscript lamda Endscripts normal upper Psi left bracket lamda right bracket upper W Subscript lamda Baseline left bracket upper A right bracket𝚿[A] = ∑
λ 𝚿[λ]Wλ[A]. A given state
will therefore be a sum of loops. These loops may in general be knotted, and hence
topologically distinct from each other. Such states will satisfy the Gauss constraint,
as Wilson loops are gauge-invariant. They will also satisfy the diffeomorphism con-
straint. In fact, diffeomorphism invariance actually helps us reduce the number of
basis states, thereby avoiding a potentially awkward problem. In a theory with a ﬁxed
background and a well-deﬁned metric any tiny change in the shape of a Wilson loop
will lead to a different loop holonomy, since parallel transport is path-dependent.
If different loops are taken to be the orthonormal basis states, this means that each
deformation of a loop results in a new state, orthonormal to every other loop. But in
a diffeomorphism-invariant theory it is not possible to distinguish between any two

66

loops that may be smoothly deformed into each other, and hence the space of loops
consists of only a single member of each topological equivalence class.
Now we must ask whether Wilson loops satisfy the Hamiltonian constraint. Firstly
we observe that the triads (or tetrads when we are working in four dimensions) are
the conjugate momenta to the connection. In quantum mechanics the operator for
the momentum corresponds to derivation with respect to the position coordinate,

The exact form of the resulting functional derivatives is not important for the moment.
However, as will be discussed below (Eq. (6.10)) the loop holonomies contain a
term representing the tangent vector to the curve along which the loop holonomy is
evaluated.ButthetangentvectortotheloopisModifyingAbove lamda With dot equals normal d lamda divided by normal d s˙λ = dλ/ds wheress parametrisespoints

pull out factors of ModifyingAbove lamda With dot˙λ. Then since upper F Superscript k Baseline Subscript a b Baseline equals minus upper F Superscript k Baseline Subscript b aFkab = −Fkba it follows that summation over the
indices of the curvature yields zero, and hence upper F Superscript k Baseline Subscript a b Baseline ModifyingAbove lamda With dot Superscript a Baseline ModifyingAbove lamda With dot Superscript b Baseline equals 0Fkab ˙λa ˙λb = 0, conﬁrming that the
Hamiltonian constraint is satisﬁed.
This loop basis gives us a picture of spacetime at the smallest scale, consisting of
closed paths carrying representations of SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2). It now remains to interpret the loop
basis in terms of physical observables.

Kinematical Hilbert Space
In light of the discussion at the end of the previous chapter, we see that spacetime can
be represented by a wide range of loop states. These may consist of simple closed
loops. The loops may be linked through each other. They may also be knotted, and
hence classiﬁed by knot invariants. And the loops may intersect, creating vertices
at which three or more Wilson lines meet. Historically the importance of all these
possibilities has been considered, and continues to be assessed. We will simply take
the view that a general loop state can have all of the properties listed above, and
turn our attention to understanding the kinematics inherent to this loop picture of
spacetime.
Before we dive straight in to the main subject matter of this chapter it is useful to
introduce a simple model of space, and examine its kinematics. This will allow us to
familiarise the reader with the terminology that will follow, as well as introducing
the basic concepts by which areas and volumes of spacetime regions can be deﬁned.
This also sets the stage for a discussion of dynamics, to be pursued in Chap. 7, in a
low-dimensional case that is easy to visualise.
Throughout this chapter several expressions arise which involve spin operators
and components, and the reader should bear in mind that we will be relying heavily on
the convention thatbold italic j comma bold italic upper J j, J (i.e. in bold) refer to spins, whilej comma upper J j, J are indices. However
we will still write “3-j j symbol” and “6-j j symbol” as these are the names of particular
mathematical structures, rather than the notation that denotes their values.

Kinematics via a Toy Model
Consider a two-dimensional manifold, embedded in three dimensions. The topology
of the mainfold could be arbitrary but to develop useful terminology we are only
concerned with a small region of it, so it may as well not have any handles or holes.
Such a manifold is what we would commonly think of in day-to-day life as a surface,
and can be approximated by a set of ﬂat triangles. By “ﬂat triangles” we mean that the
region within the three edges of each triangle is a subset ofdouble struck upper R squaredR2. Of course, the triangles

Fig.6.1 An example of a
triangulation of a 2D surface
will not necessarily be coplanar with each other, and so the whole arrangement will
resemble interlocking triangular scales on the skin of some animal. The surface
being approximated may have some (extrinsic and/or intrinsic) curvature, and so we
describe the triangular approximation as piecewise ﬂat. The dimensionality of the
triangles (being 2) is one less than that of the space in which they are embedded.
The triangles themselves meet at 1-dimensional edges, and the edges meet at 0-
dimensional vertices. Each triangle is referred to as a simplex (plural, simplices).
Therefore the surface is covered by a pattern of simplices clustered around vertices,
as depicted in Fig.6.1. We will refer to this entire arrangement of simplices, edges,
and vertices as a triangulation, denoted DeltaΔ. The lengths x 1x1, x 2x2, x 3x3 of the edges of
each two-dimensional simplex must obey the triangle inequality,x 1 plus x 2 greater than or equals x 3x1 + x2 ≥x3 (and
of course this relation must hold true for any permutations of 1, 2, and 3).
If the surface being triangulated is ﬂat (i.e. has no intrinsic curvature) traversing
a closed path1 will mean turning through a total of 360 Superscript degrees360◦or 2 pi2π. However if some
of the triangular simplices adjacent to the vertex at the centre of such a closed
path were removed and the remaining simplices reconnected, a closed path would
traverse less than2 pi2π (or more, if instead extra simplices were added). In this case the
triangulated surface would no longer be intrinsically ﬂat, but would have negative or
positive curvature, measured by the deﬁcit angle, or deviation from 2 pi2π encountered
when following a closed path. In short, curvature exists on the boundaries between
ﬂat simplices. This is intuitively equivalent to the idea that traversing the boundary
of a ﬂat paper disk means travelling through an angle of 2 pi2π radians from one’s
starting point, however if a wedge is cut out of the disk and the gap where the wedge
was removed is closed up the paper disk is now no longer ﬂat, but must become
conical. In other words, the paper disk has acquired some intrinsic curvature, and its
circumference has changed from2 pi r2πr toleft parenthesis 2 pi minus theta right parenthesis r(2π −θ)r wherethetaθ is the “deﬁcit angle”, as
per Fig.6.2.
Inwhatfollowsthereisacorrespondencethatcanbedrawnbetweentriangulations
and graphs. A graph is a set of discrete elements often referred to as nodes, points,
or vertices, however we will use the term ‘hubs’, along with a set of associations
between some pairs of hubs. These associations are often called edges, lines, or links,
however we will use the terminology ‘tracks’. Our reason for adopting this slightly
unusual terminology is to maintain clarity when switching between discussions of
abstract graphs, triangulations, and dual triangulations (to be introduced shortly). If
nn tracks meet at a hub that hub is said to be nn-valent.2
1 For instance, one which remains one step away from a speciﬁed vertex, as in Fig.6.2.
2 In the general case it is possible for a track to begin and end on the same hub, however we will
ignore this subtlety for now.

A triangulation DeltaΔ can be thought of as a type of graph. The vertices of a trian-
gulation correspond with hubs of the associated graph, and edges correspond with
tracks. Henceforth any mention of vertices and edges will imply a reference to a
triangulation, not an abstract graph.
Given a triangulationDeltaΔ, we can construct a dual triangulation, denotedDelta Superscript asteriskΔ∗, which
consists of a graph having hubs at the centres of the simplices ofDeltaΔ and tracks which
each cross through exactly one of the edges ofDeltaΔ. We shall refer to the hubs of a dual
triangulation as ‘nodes’, and the tracks of a dual triangulation as ‘links’. Henceforth
any mention of nodes and links will imply a reference to a dual triangulation, not an
abstract graph.
In our two-dimensional model, each two-dimensional simplex is dual to a zero-
dimensional node, and each one-dimensional edge is dual to a one-dimensional link.
Since the simplices in this model are triangular, each node is trivalent (that is, exactly
three links meet at each node), as per Fig.6.3. It is commonplace, and somewhat more
general, to refer to each of these elements as kk-cells. So a triangular simplex is an
example of a 2-cell,3 edges and links are 1-cells, vertices and nodes are 0-cells.
This is the basis of terminology the reader may sometimes encounter, with (dual)
triangulations and their higher-dimensional analogues referred to as piecewise linear
cell complexes.
As noted above, each 1-cell (edge) inDeltaΔ is dual to exactly one 1-cell (link) inDelta Superscript asteriskΔ∗,
and each simplex (2-cell) in DeltaΔ is dual to a node (0-cell) in Delta Superscript asteriskΔ∗. Therefore if a label
exists upon an edge, the same label can be associated with the corresponding link,
and vice versa.
We can anticipate some of the results to be introduced later by recognising that
a graph in which the tracks and/or hubs have some extra information associated
with them can model more complex physical systems than a graph which consists
of “bare” elements, and these can be relevant to the dynamics of such models. For
3 Though a general 2-cell could be a rectangle or hexagon or any other polygon.

instance Ising models are simply graphs with the value of a spin variable associated
to each hub. In general, the extra information associated to the graph could be a
sense of direction, allowing us to think of hub ii as the source of a track, and hub f f
as the destination of a track. It could be scalar values corresponding to lengths of the
tracks. In general, it could be elements drawn from any set or group we choose to
utilise. In fact, a bare graph can be thought of as a graph whose tracks are labelled by
copies of the identity element, which are representations of the trivial group. If the
tracks carry some labels, there may be constraints on the labels assigned to adjacent
tracks. We have already encountered an example of such a constraint in the form of
the triangle inequality, as mentioned above.
This brings us to a conception very much like Penrose’s original proposal of spin
networks [1]. As conceived, these were graphs with trivalent hubs, each track being
labelled by a positive integer. It was originally intended that these spin networks
could provide a geometrical concept of spacetime structure, and only later was it
recognisedthattheyoccurredintheoriesofquantumgravity.Inlightofthepreceeding
discussion,theirsimilaritytothedualtriangulationswehaveintroducedaboveshould
be apparent.
The integer labelsnn assigned to the tracks of one of Penrose’s spin networks must
obey certain constraints. For the three tracks attached to any hub, no single label
should exceed the sum of the other two labels, and the sum of all the labels should be
even. The ﬁrst of these conditions is simply the triangle inequality. But taken together,
they can be seen to be consistent with the addition of spin angular momentum values,
bold italic j equals n italic h over two pi divided by 2 j = nh/2, for some integersn greater than or equals 0n ≥0. Penrose hoped to develop a concept of spacetime
that was not reliant upon the existence of a background coordinate system, and hence
the labels on the tracks of a network could only represent total angular momentum,
not some component thereof in a preferred direction. The rules for coupling the nn
values would be used to perform a type of graphical calculation of probabilities,
from which a sense of ‘parallelism’ and ‘orthogonality’ could be assigned to pairs
of regions of spin networks. In this way the idea of a geometry for spacetime was
supposed to build up, starting with nothing but combinatorics.
With this in mind we will associate spins bold italic j greater than or equals 0 j ≥0 with the three links meeting at
a node in Delta Superscript asteriskΔ∗(and with the corresponding edges in DeltaΔ). It is commonly said that we
label the links with representations of SU(2), although this terminology is probably
not the clearest. It would be better to say that we associate representations of SU(2)
with the links and since representations can be labelled by the maximum eigenvalues,
bold italic j j, which characterise the left parenthesis 2 bold italic j plus 1 right parenthesis(2 j + 1)-dimensional representation of SU(2), we in turn
label the links by the corresponding bold italic j j values. Recall that SU(2) is a double-cover

of the rotation group in three dimensions, SO(3). We can view the intersection of
three links at a node as the coupling of three spins. In general there is an extra detail
to be taken into account—the links carry an associated direction, from one node
to another. There is then a label associated with each node, called an “intertwining
operator” or more commonly just an intertwiner, generally denoted modifying above dotless iı, which is a
mapping from the space of representationsrho Subscript aρa on the links incoming to that node, to
the space of representations rho prime Subscript bρ'
b on the links outgoing from the node, that is to say

An alternative but equally valid way of regarding an intertwiner is as a mapping

as belonging to the space of products of dual representations, and providing a scalar

et al. [2].

where the left parenthesis bold italic j Subscript i Baseline comma m Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis( ji, mi) are the orbital and magnetic quantum numbers of the iith sys-

The 3-j j symbols are non-zero only if three conditions are met; the sum
m 1 plus m 2 plus m 3 equals 0m1 + m2 + m3 = 0, thebold italic j j values are all greater than or equal to zero, and thebold italic j j val-
ues satisfy the triangle inequality. Given the summation in Eq. (6.2) we can see that
3-j j symbols treat the three angular momenta more symmetrically than the Clebsch-
Gordon coefﬁcients, so that intertwining of representations at a node maps freely
between the links chosen to be incoming and outgoing from a given node. Associ-
ating the 3-j j symbols to a node means that no single bold italic j j value exceeds the sum of
the other two (e.g.bold italic j 1 plus bold italic j 2 minus bold italic j 3 greater than or equals 0 j1 + j2 −j3 ≥0) and furthermore that no value is less than the
difference of the other two (e.g. bold italic j 3 greater than or equals StartAbsoluteValue bold italic j 1 minus bold italic j 2 EndAbsoluteValue j3 ≥| j1 −j2|). These conditions hold true under
permutation of the indices 1, 2, 3. Ultimately the constraints on the values of the spin
labels mean that the areas of the 2-cells can only take discrete values.
Now that we have a two-dimensional model with descriptive terminology in place,
let us develop a three-dimensional model. We will want to do this because the space
we live in is three-dimensional, and ultimately the model we develop will corre-
spond to a sheet of a spacelike foliation of four-dimensional spacetime, such as we
encountered when performing the ADM splitting in Sect.4.2. The simplices in the
two-dimensional case were triangles—polygons with the minimum possible num-
ber of edges. In three dimensions the simplices will be tetrahedra—the polyhedra
with the minimum number of faces. Each tetrahedron is bounded by four triangular
faces, has six edges, and four vertices. Hence if we label the edges (as before) with
eigenvalues of representations of SU(2), each simplex is associated to six spins. As
before we can construct a dual cell complex, with nodes corresponding to the centres
of tetrahedra, and links piercing the triangular faces of the tetrahedra, as depicted
in Fig.6.4b (as the reader may have deduced from the two-dimensional case, in dd
dimensions akk-cell is dual to a (d minus kd −k)-cell). Thebold italic j j values associated to edges are not
lengths, but we will see in Sect. 6.3 that they are used in a pairwise fashion to deﬁne
the areas of the faces of tetrahedral simplices occurring in the three-dimensional
case.
As in the two-dimensional case there are constraints to be satisﬁed in constructing
a viable cell complex. The triangle inequality places constraints on the allowed edge
lengths, for two-dimensional triangulations. However, restrictions on the areas of
faces are not enough to uniquely deﬁne a tetrahedron. The relationships between
them are determined by an extension of the concept of the 3-j j symbol, namely the
Wigner 6-j j symbols. These occur in the addition of three angular momenta to form
a fourth (total) angular momentum, and can be written as the sum over products of
four 3-j j symbols,

angular momenta. The 6-j j symbol can be visualised as the tetrahedral Yutsis graph4
(Fig.6.4b). Symmetries of the graph correspond to invariance of the 6-j j symbol
under permutations of its columns, and the interchange of upper and lower symbols
in any two columns. Even though a tetrahedral Yutsis graph has six edges, the 6-j j
symbol imposes a restriction to a condition between four angular momenta. This can
be understood by “peeling open” the tetrahedron into a pair of couplings between
four spins, with any three meeting at a vertex of the tetrahedron (corresponding to
the decomposition into four 3-j j symbols, mentioned above). In the case of Fig.6.4b
we would have, for example, that the value of bold italic j 3 j3 is determined by the values of
the pairs StartSet bold italic j 1 comma bold italic j 2 EndSet{ j1, j2} and StartSet bold italic j 4 comma bold italic j 5 EndSet{ j4, j5}, and likewise the value of bold italic j 6 j6 is determined by the
values of the pairs StartSet bold italic j 1 comma bold italic j 5 EndSet{ j1, j5} and StartSet bold italic j 2 comma bold italic j 4 EndSet{ j2, j4}. Of course, other permutations of these
relationships are equally valid. Hence the constraint requiring that the six edges
form a closed tetrahedron ensures that there are only four independent spin labels,
which are associated with the areas of faces (or links in the dual cell complex).5
The tetrahedral simplices described correspond to tetravalent (i.e. 4-valent) nodes,
at which four links l 1l1, l 2l2, l 3l3, l 4l4 meet. Each node can be decomposed into a pair of
trivalent nodes, for instance by considering the linksl 1l1,l 2l2 and an intermediate linkl Subscript ili
to meet at one node, and the links l 3l3, l 4l4 and l Subscript ili to meet at the other node. There is, of
course, an ambiguity about which external links meet at the same node, resulting in
several possible decompositions, as per Fig.6.5. The intertwining operators at each
node provide weightings for each decomposition via the relevant 6-j j symbols, which
are determined by the 3-j j symbols (Fig.6.6).
Having spent some time developing the conceptual foundations of spin networks,
we will now proceed with a more mathematically explicit discussion. Naturally
4 A graph is a Yutsis graph if it can be partitioned into two subgraphs which are each connected
(there is a path between each node and any other node) and acyclic (there is only one path between
a node and any other node).
5 For a more detailed discussion of this the reader is recommended to consult Sect.3.4 of [2], as
well as the wikipedia articles ‘6-j j symbol’ and ‘Racah W-coefﬁcient’.

Fig. 6.5 A 4-valent node can be decomposed into a pair of 3-valent nodes in multiple ways. The

Fig. 6.6 Using Penrose’s spin network rules to provide a simpliﬁed example of how intertwiners
determine the decomposition of a 4-valent node into two 3-valent nodes. The illustration on the left
is admissible, but the illustration on the right is not, as one label (with value 2) is greater than the
sum of the other two labels at the same node
this will involve reiterating several points already made above, but hopefully the
associated ideas will be clearer as a result. Henceforth we will consider a loop state
to be a graph or network normal upper Gamma⎡with tracks labelled by elements of some gauge group

where g Subscript igi is the holonomy of upper AA along the iith track, deﬁned in Eq. (6.10), below.6
Pictorially, we can imagine something like Fig.6.7a. It is also possible to label the
tracks of these graphs by angular momenta, as per Fig.6.7b, by making use of the
Peter-Weyl theorem (Appendix H). At this point a graph normal upper Gamma⎡consisting of tracks tauτ

6 The expression “holonomy of a track” may surprise the reader. We have previously referred to
a loop holonomy, which measures curvature within a closed path, and described the effect of the
connection along a general curve as Eq. (3.26), the Schwinger line integral. As noted in Rovelli and
Vidotto [3], the use of the term holonomy in the quantum gravity community is a bit different from
the more generally-accepted use of the term. For the sake of consistency with other works in the
LQG literature we take this opportunity to point out that in LQG the name holonomy is frequently
used to refer to the path-ordered exponential of the connection along an arbitrary curve, and will
use it in this sense from now on. Only in the special case where the curve is closed upon itself will
we revert to using the term “loop holonomy”.
7 The use ofchiχ to denote hubs is somewhat unorthodox. Most authors use the term “vertex” much
more freely than is done here, and adopt the symbolvv accordingly, but as alluded to above this risks
confusing triangulations, dual triangulations, and abstract graphs. As a possibly helpful mnemonic
device, recognise that the letterchiχ looks like the convergence of four tracks at a single hub.

Fig. 6.7 States of quantum geometry are given by arbitrary graphs whose tracks are labelled by
group elements representing the holonomy along each track. These graphs can take quite compli-
cated forms. The Peter-Weyl theorem allows us to decompose these states in terms of spin network
states, where tracks are labelled by group representations (angular momenta)

Shortly we shall identify spin networks with dual triangulations, so that hubs of the
graph constituting a spin network are equivalent to nodes, and the tracks of the graph
are equivalent to links.

We now wish to identify operators corresponding to physical observables of the
spacetime. These operators should be based upon the physical structure of the graphs
under consideration. It is worth noting at this point that in the Hamiltonian approach
to quantum gravity that we have pursued there is an ambiguity as to whether we
choose the connection or the triads as the conﬁguration variables. In fact either
choice is permissible, but the physical interpretation of connections as conﬁguration
variables and triads as conjugate momenta is more straightforward, and as we shall
see it allows us to write operators that generate discrete areas and volumes.
In order to obtain suitable regularised operators in conventional quantum ﬁeld
theory, one must smear the ﬁeld corresponding to conﬁguration and momentum
variables over three-dimensional regions. For instance the operatorModifyingAbove normal upper Phi With caret Subscript f ˆΦ f , for the con-
ﬁguration variable phiφ in a scalar ﬁeld theory, would be constructed by smearing the
ﬁeld operator with some function f left parenthesis x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis f (xμ) over some compact subset upper U element of script upper MU ∈M of the

is that it depends on the structure of the background spacetime, which enters through
the integration measure. In a curved spacetime with metric g Subscript mu nugμν, the integral (6.5)

Our goal is a background-independent treatment of geometrical observables. For
this to be possible the smearing procedure should also be background-independent.
In a theory of connections and triads such a procedure is already well known—the
construction of holonomy variables by integrating (“smearing”) the connection along
a one-dimensional curve. We write holonomies (compare Eq. (3.30)) in the form

However, there is an ambiguity in the above procedure because a given statevertical bar normal upper Psi right angle bracket|Ψ⟩

overcome by extending the conﬁguration space script upper AA of regular (smooth, continuous)

arbitrarily discontinuous and need only be continuous along one-dimensional curves.
For further details and discussion the reader is referred to [6–8].

Area Operator
The area operator in quantum geometry is deﬁned in analogy with the classical
deﬁnition of the area of a two-dimensional surface upper SS embedded in some higher
dimensional manifold script upper MM. To impart an intuitive idea of what follows, we may
consider a classical tetrahedron, with each of its triangular faces qualifying as a
surface upper SS as just described. If we treat one vertex of this tetrahedron as the origin,
9 For the interested reader, in particular, we recommend reading [4, Sect. 3] and [5, Sect. I.2] for
details on the historical developments which led to use of spin networks as the basic objects in
LQG.
10 A Haar measure assigns an invariant concept of volume to subsets of locally compact topological
groups (these are sets for which each neighbourhood of a point can be considered to be a closed set,
the neighbourhoods around any two distinct points have empty intersection i.e. it is Hausdorff, and
the set is endowed with a binary operation making it a group.) The exact form of this measure will
depend on the group in question. It serves the useful purpose of establishing a concept of volume
that makes it possible to deﬁne integrals for the functions of locally compact topological groups.

Fig.6.8 Classically a tetrahedron can be deﬁned by three vectors, with any two deﬁning one of the
three faces closest to the origin, and all three deﬁning the fourth face. The magnitude of the wedge
product of any pair of vectors is twice the area of the corresponding face, and the length of the
normal vector.→n to that face is proportional to this area, since the normal vector and wedge product
are dual to each other
then the tetrahedron can be deﬁned by a set of three vectors, denotedModifyingAbove u With right arrow Subscript 1 Baseline comma ModifyingAbove u With right arrow Subscript 2 Baseline comma ModifyingAbove u With right arrow Subscript 3 Baseline→u1, →u2, →u3, all

The normal vector to the face is dual to this bivector, and thus its length measures the
area of the face. We immediately recognise that classical angular momentum may
be regarded as a bivector ModifyingAbove r With right arrow and ModifyingAbove p With right arrow→r ∧→p, owing to the connection between wedge products
and cross products noted in Sect.B.3. The same holds true of angular momentum
in quantum mechanics. This hints strongly that the area of a face can be regarded
as a measure of angular momentum, and in the quantum case, with links (carrying
angular momentum labels) being dual to the triangular faces of tetrahedral simplices,
the area of a face should be related to the spin eigenvalues of the associated links.
This implies that the areas of the faces would take discrete values. Let us explore
these ideas more precisely.
In the simplest case the two-dimensional surface upper SS is a piece of double struck upper R squaredR2 embedded in
double struck upper R cubedR3. In general bothupper SS and the higher-dimensional manifold may have some curvature.
To make use of notation developed above, and without loss of generality, we will
presume upper SS is embedded in a three-dimensional manifold normal upper Sigma∑obtained by foliating
four-dimensional spacetime (see Sect.4.2). To each point s element of upper Ss ∈S we can associate
a triad or “frame ﬁeld” i.e. a set of vectors StartSet ModifyingAbove bold e With right arrow Subscript 1 Baseline comma ModifyingAbove bold e With right arrow Subscript 2 Baseline comma ModifyingAbove bold e With right arrow Subscript 3 Baseline EndSet{→e1, →e2, →e3} which form a basis for the

more succinctly as left brace e Subscript a Baseline Superscript i Baseline right brace Subscript s{eai}s where a comma b comma c element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSeta, b, c ∈{1, 2, 3} index the vectors and i comma j comma k ellipsisi, j, k . . .
label the components of each individual vector in the active or “chosen” coordinate
system. The indices i comma j comma k ellipsisi, j, k . . . are necessary because if upper SS is curved (i.e. the gauge
connectionupper A Subscript aAa is non-zero) the basis at two distinct points inupper SS need not be the same,
and hence a given vector ModifyingAbove bold e With right arrow Subscript a→ea will have different components at different points.

P is inserted in order for both sides to have the correct dimensions.15 We have
therefore found a way of assigning quantised areas to graph states. As the discussion
in Sect.6.1 implied, we would like to use this to operator to assign area to the faces
of a simplex. We can therefore identify the graph of a spin network with a dual
triangulation, and ascribe area to the faces of a simplex by applying Eq. (6.29) to the
spin labels of the links which are dual to these faces.

Volume Operator
Having found a way of assigning quantised area to the faces dual to the tracks of
graph states (spin networks) in Sect.6.3 it is natural to search for an operator which
could assign volume to the regions enclosed by these faces (Fig.6.10). Similarly to
the two-dimensional case, we ﬁnd that the volume of a region of spacescript upper RR is given by

between the two versions lies in this term. The RS operator does not take account
16 In [9] a construction based on the geometry of classical polyhedra is used to obtain an expression
for the volume operator which acts on nodes with valence greater than four. For nodes with fewer
than four links, the associated volume always vanishes independent of the choice of the volume
operator. For other interesting work, see [10] where the pentahedral volume operator is analyzed
and classical chaos is found in the resulting dynamics.

of the orientation of the tracks which meet at the hub, while the AL version does,
and it allows us to speak of a phase transition from a high-temperature (upper T greater than upper T Subscript cT > Tc)
state of geometry, where the volume operator averages to zero for all graphs (which
are “large” in some suitable sense) and a low-temperature (upper T less than upper T Subscript cT < Tc) state where a
geometric condensate forms and the volume operator gains a non-zero expectation
value for states on all graphs. Temperature, in this case, is a parameter with an
externally-imposed value, which determines the probability that the orientation of
any track will ﬂip. The key point here is that the AL version takes into account
the “sign” of the volume contribution from any triplet of tracks meeting at a hub.
Given any such triplet of tracks e Subscript upper I Baseline comma e Subscript upper J Baseline comma e Subscript upper K BaselineeI, eJ, eK , by ﬂipping the orientation of any one
track we ﬂip the sign of the corresponding contribution to ModifyingAbove upper V With caret Subscript upper S Superscript AL.V AL

will ﬂip randomly and the sum over the triplets of tracks in ModifyingAbove upper V With caret Subscript upper S Superscript AL.V AL
S
will give zero for
most (if not all) graph states. As we lower the temperature the system begins to
anneal and for some temperature upper T equals upper T Subscript cT = Tc the system should reach a critical point
where the volume operator spontaneously develops a non-zero expectation on most
(if not all) graph states.
Note that:
1. Since the result of the volume operator acting on a hub depends on the signs
epsilon left parenthesis e Subscript upper I Baseline comma e Subscript upper J Baseline comma e Subscript upper K Baseline right parenthesisϵ(eI, eJ, eK ) of each triplet of tracks, a simple dynamical system would then
consist of a ﬁxed graph with ﬁxed spin assignments (bold italic j Subscript e je) to tracks but with orien-
tations that can ﬂip, i.e. bold italic j Subscript e Baseline left right arrow minus bold italic j Subscript e je ↔−je (much like a spin).
2. The Hamiltonian must be a hermitian operator. This ﬁxes the various terms one
can include in it. We must also include all terms consistent with all the allowed
symmetries in our model.
3. The simplest trivalent spin network has one node with three links (as depicted
by the orange hexagonal lattice in Fig.6.3). One can generalize the action of the
volume operator on graphs which have hubs with valencenn (number of connecting
tracks) greater than 3. (The volume operator gives zero on vertices withn less than or equals 2n ≤2 so
these are excluded). To do so we use the fundamental identity which allows us
to decompose the state describing a hub with n greater than or equals 4n ≥4 into a sum over states with
n equals 3n = 3. Examples of the decomposition of a four valent hub into two three-valent
hubs are given in Fig.6.5.
4. This model can help us understand how a macroscopic geometry can emerge from
the“spin”ormany-bodysystemdescribedbyaHamiltonian,whichcontainsterms
with the volume and area operators, on a spin network.
We are supposing here that the connections between hubs are ﬁxed in place, to create
a static lattice, and only their orientations are allowed to vary. On a tetrahedral lattice
with ﬁxed bold italic j equals 1 divided by 2 j = 1/2, the associated volume at each hub has only two eigenvalues,
plus or minus upper V 0V0, with the sign being determined by the orientation of the spins on
the adjoining tracks.

Spin Networks
This discussion leaves us with a simple mental picture of spin networks, which we
sketched in a somewhat intuitive fashion in Sect.6.1, and which we reiterate here
after having developed it more rigorously. Brieﬂy, spin networks are graphs with
representations (“spins”) of some gauge group (generally SUleft parenthesis 2 right parenthesis(2) orSL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) in LQG)
living on each track. We can equate the spin network graphs with dual triangulations
of a manifold, with eachnn-valent node being dual to a simplex withnn faces, and each
link being dual to a face. By the arguments used above to deﬁne area and volume
operators, the areas of the faces of a simplex, and the area of the simplex itself are
determined by the spin labels on the relevant links. Since each link corresponds with
the parallel transport of spin from one node to another, it is necessary to ensure that
angular momentum is conserved at nodes, and so an intertwiner is associated with
each node. For the case of a four-valent node we have four spins, left parenthesis bold italic j 1 comma bold italic j 2 comma bold italic j 3 comma bold italic j 4 right parenthesis( j1, j2, j3, j4).
More generally a polyhedron with nn faces represents an intertwiner between the
edges piercing each one of the faces.
To put it another way, there is a simple visual picture of the intertwiner. In the
four-valent case, picture a tetrahedron enclosing a given node, such that each link
pierces precisely one face of the tetrahedron. Now, the natural prescription for what
happens when a surface is punctured by a spin is to associate the Casimir of that
spin bold italic upper J squaredJ2 with the puncture. The Casimir for spin bold italic j j has eigenvalues bold italic j left parenthesis bold italic j plus 1 right parenthesis j( j + 1). These
eigenvalues are identiﬁed with the area associated with a puncture.
In order for the links and nodes to correspond to a consistent geometry it is
important that certain constraints be satisﬁed. For instance, for a triangle we require
that the edge lengths satisfy the triangle inequalitya plus b less than ca + b < c and the angles should
add up to angle a plus angle b plus angle c equals kappa pi∠a + ∠b + ∠c = κπ, with kappa equals 1κ = 1 if the triangle is embedded in a ﬂat
space andkappa not equals 1κ /= 1 denoting the deviation of the space from zero curvature (positively
or negatively curved).
In a similar manner, for a classical tetrahedron, now it is the sums of the areas
of the faces which should satisfy “closure” constraints. For a quantum tetrahedron
these constraints translate into relations between the operators bold italic j Subscript i ji which endow the
faces with area.
For a triangle, giving its three edge lengths left parenthesis a comma b comma c right parenthesis(a, b, c) completely ﬁxes the angles
and there is no more freedom. However, specifying the areas of all four faces of
a tetrahedron does not ﬁx all the freedom. The tetrahedron can still be bent and
distorted in ways that preserve the closure constraints. These are the physical degrees
of freedom that an intertwiner possesses—the various shapes that are consistent with
a tetrahedron with a given set of face areas. We can understand this as meaning that
when tetrahedra are “glued together” the areas of the joined faces must match, but
the shapes of the joined faces do not need to match (and are, in fact, meaningless in
a background-independent context).

Kinematical Hilbert Space
6.6
Looking Ahead to Spin Foams
In LQG the kinematical entities describing a given state of quantum geometry are
spin networks. The dynamical entities—i.e. those that encode the evolution and
history of spin networks—are known as spin foams. If a spin network describes a
dd-dimensional spacelike geometry, then a spin foam describes a possible history
which maps this spin network into another one, via some series of intermediate spin
networks embedded within d plus 1d + 1 dimensions, all of which are within the kinemat-
ical Hilbert space. The name spin foam derives from the superﬁcial resemblance
borne to a mass of soap bubbles by the structure produced when a spin network is
“extruded” through one higher dimension. In order to determine the transition ampli-
tudes between two different states of quantum geometry whose initial and ﬁnal states
are given by spin networks upper S Subscript iSi and upper S Subscript fSf, one must sum over all possible spin foams
which interpolate between the two spin network states. This sum over spin foams
should sound familiar, since it is essentially the sum over geometries mentioned near
the end of Sect.4.1 in our discussion of the Einstein-Hilbert action, and subsequent
discussion of the ADM splitting.
We will turn our attention to spin foams more fully in the next chapter, but note
here that when the sum over all allowed histories is performed one ﬁnds that the
resulting amplitude depends only on the boundary conﬁguration of spins. This is
holography. The holographic principle boils down to saying that the state of a system
is determined by the state of its boundary. Therefore, although the point is not made
as often as it possibly should be, LQG embodies the holographic principle in a very
fundamental way. This point is discussed in more detail in Chap. 9.
The remainder of this book will deal with the dynamics of spacetime in loop
quantum gravity, and the applications of LQG to physical scenarios which may lend
themselves to experimental testing of the theory. It is not our intention to discuss
any of the subsequent topics in exhaustive detail. We do hope, though, that a good
overview of the recent developments in LQG, and its applications to a range of topics
(like cosmology, for instance) will help anyone new to the ﬁeld understand where to
turn next as they investigate loop quantum gravity and related ideas for themselves.

Dynamics of Spin Networks 
The discussion has reached a point where we understand the basic structure of space-
time in loop quantum gravity. In short, the similarities between general relativity and 
quantum ﬁeld theory have been noted, and we have seen how a foliation that allows 
us to view spacetime in terms of generalised coordinates and canonical momenta 
can be constructed. The quantization of this model brings us to a point where the 
structure of spacetime is viewed as discrete, and composed of intersecting loops. This 
enables us to view the kinematics of the theory in terms of one-dimensional links 
that meet at nodes, the valence of any node being equal to the number of links that 
meet there, and each node being associated with a discrete volume contribution to 
a spatial manifold. The earlier “chain-mail” conception of interlinking loops (which 
inspired the name loop quantum gravity) has largely given way to this graph-based 
concept of spin networks. 
Of course, the most signiﬁcant feature of general relativity is that it is a theory of 
dynamical spacetime. Therefore, while kinematics are important, it is not sufﬁcient 
to treat spacetime as a static network, but we should also ask how this quantised 
spacetime can change its geometry. Without this ability, our quantum spacetime is 
unable to account for the full range of phenomona that occur within general relativity. 
To this end, we will now turn to the topic we touched on at the end of the previous 
chapter, spin foams. We have come a long way since the discussions of quantum 
ﬁeld theory and classical general relativity at the start of this book. These topics are 
covered in a profusion of textbooks, and should be familiar to most physicists, but 
we are now heading into territory where less familiar concepts lurk, and ideas from 
group theory, quantum ﬁeld theory, and graph theory mix together in surprising ways. 
As we proceed, we will focus on describing concepts clearly and spelling out the 
meanings of terminology that may be used in unfamiliar ways, and also mention the 
historical development of these ideas, setting the reader up to explore more thorough 
mathematical coverage of each topic in their own further reading.

Dynamics of Spin Networks 
7.1
Spin Foams 
A spin foam corresponds to a history which connects two spin network states. To build 
an intuition for how this can be achieved, we will return to the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional toy models we developed in Sect. 6.1. Consider a spin network— 
that is, a dual triangulation Delta Superscript asteriskΔ∗ of a two-dimensional surface script upper SS, embedded in three 
dimensions. Now extend each kk-cell in Delta Superscript asteriskΔ∗ away from the surface. Every kk-cell 
will extrude to a left parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis(k + 1)-cell, and the ﬁnal spin network obtained is a copy of the 
dual triangulation Delta Superscript asteriskΔ∗. The cell complex we have obtained is a trivial example of 
a spin foam. If we think of the spin foam as a mapping from a dual triangulation 
of an initial surface to a dual triangulation of a ﬁnal surface then we have in fact 
just described the “identity spin foam”. Although simple, this example serves two 
primary purposes. Firstly, it explains the motivation behind the name, since it looks a 
bit like a foam of soap bubbles. And secondly, it shows that the labels on thekk-cells of 
the original triangulation (for k greater than or equals 0k ≥ 0) are carried by the correspondingleft parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis(k + 1)-cells 
of the spin foam—hence the 2-cells of the spin foam (which we will call sheets) carry 
spins, and the 1-cells of the spin foam (which we will call edges) carry intertwiners. 
Naturally we can imagine an equivalent process happening simultaneously with the 
triangulationDeltaΔ, since we can constructDeltaΔ fromDelta Superscript asteriskΔ∗ and vice-versa, and so we are also 
constructing a copy of the surface script upper SS. The three-dimensional region “swept out” by 
the triangulationDeltaΔ (as opposed to the spin network) as it extends away from script upper SS can 
be identiﬁed asscript upper S times left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracketS × [0, 1], where naturallyleft bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket[0, 1] is a subset ofdouble struck upper RR. We can therefore 
imagine that we have two parallel surfaces, script upper S 0S0 and script upper S 1S1. If the process were repeated 
nn times we would have a succession of two-dimensional manifolds upper S Subscript iSi, with spin 
networks embedded in them. This is entirely analogous to the foliation of spacetime 
which we encountered in Sect. 4.2, and so we should regard the variable ii as a time 
parameter. 
Any valid (non-trivial) dynamics for spin networks must transform an initial 
network in the kinematical Hilbert space into another network also in the kinemat-
ical Hilbert space. There are two basic transformations from which the transitions 
between network states can be built. These are the “2-to-2” move, in which we take 
a pair of triangular 2-cells connected along a single edge, and redeﬁne the edge to 
run between the two vertices which they do not initially have in common, and the 
“1-to-3” move, in which a single triangle is split into three. These evolution moves 
(and thus the process of extruding a triangulation) can also be viewed in terms of 
the dual triangulationDelta Superscript asteriskΔ∗, which is a trivalent graph as noted before. From this per-
spective the 2-to-2 move consists of an adjacent pair of trivalent nodes in a network 
exchanging one incoming link each, and the 1-to-3 move consists of a single trivalent 
node splitting into three, in analogy to the “star-triangle transformation” used in the 
analysis of electrical circuits (see Fig. 7.1a). The inverse moves are also possible, of 
course, and the reader should easily recognize that the 2-to-2 move is its own inverse, 
while the inverse of the 1-to-3 move shrinks a trio of nodes down to form a single 
node. 
It can be seen from Fig. 7.1b (right) that the 1-to-3 move acting on the dual 
triangulation creates a set of sheets which form a tetrahedron having one vertex in

on the dual triangulation creates a set of sheets which form a tetrahedron having two 
vertices in each of the surfaces script upper S Subscript iSi and script upper S Subscript i plus 1Si+1. As a result, in what follows, the nodes 
of a spin network embedded indd-dimensional space will sometimes be equated with 
the vertices of a left parenthesis d plus 1 right parenthesis(d + 1)-simplex. However, it is not necessarily true that the sheets 
resulting from the evolution of a spin network in script upper S Subscript iSi to a spin network in script upper S Subscript i plus 1Si+1 will 
form simplices of the resulting spacetime. For instance, the trivial identity spin foam 
described at the start of this chapter does not divide the manifold intodd-dimensional 
simplices. It is worth stating clearly then, to avoid confusion in what follows, that the 
spin networks are dual triangulations of add-dimensional manifold, and the spin foams 
that arise from them can be seen as subdivisions (rather than dual triangulations) 
of a left parenthesis d plus 1 right parenthesis(d + 1)-dimensional manifold. However, we can see from Fig. 7.1b (left)  that  a  
triangulation (as opposed to a dual triangulation) of a two-dimensional surface gives

rise to a (2+1)-dimensional structure of tetrahedra. This is the basis of the Regge 
model of 2+1 gravity, and is ﬂeshed out further in Appendix I. 
It should be kept in mind that referring to a spin foam as a two-dimensional 
piecewise linear cell complex does not mean the spin foam is two-dimensional, 
or able to be embedded in a two-dimensional manifold. Rather, it means that the 
fundamental pieces of which the spin foam is built up are two-dimensional. Just as 
the spin network is a complex of one-dimensional line segments, the spin foam is a 
complex of two-dimensional sheets. 1 
It is fairly easy to see that a cross-section through any spin foam will single out a 
spin network intermediate between the initial and ﬁnal network states. Naturally this 
network will be of one dimension lower than the foam, hence a four-dimensional 
spin foam will (when “sliced through” by spacelike three-dimensional hypersurfaces) 
yield intermediate three-dimensional spin networks. 
This is essentially identical to the construction of a spacetime foliation at a ﬁxed 
value of ﬁducial time which we have already encountered. Note that the topology of 
the spin network (i.e. the number of nodes, and the links deﬁned between any pair 
of nodes) remain unchanged for slices between vertices of the spin foam, but can 
change when moving between slices that occur “before” and “after” any vertex. 
The discussion so far has dealt with spin networks embedded in two-dimensional 
hypersurfaces, which extrude along the time direction to produce three-dimensional 
spin foams. Since the universe in which we live is (3 plus 13 + 1)-dimensional we will want 
to extend the concepts we’ve developed so far to three-dimensional hypersurfaces 
which foliate four-dimensional spacetime. Thus we are re-treading the path laid 
out in Sect. 6.1, and as we argued there, the basic three-dimensional simplices will 
be tetrahedra. In analogy to the 2-2 and 1-3 moves already encountered, we can 
consider the evolution moves which carry a spin network in a three-dimensional 
spatial hypersurface into another hypersurface. One such move is the 1-4 move, 
which expands a single node in the spin network into a tetrahedral arrangement 
of four nodes (each node being dual to a tetrahedral 3-simplex). We can therefore 
see that four-dimensional spin foams will be composed of 4-simplices having ﬁve 
vertices (which we will identify with spin network nodes labelled 1 comma ellipsis comma 51,  .  . . ,  5 as in 
Fig. 7.2, where one node resides in hypersurfacescript upper S Subscript iSi and the other four in the surface 
script upper S Subscript i plus 1Si+1), ten edges (that is, the six edges of a tetrahedron, plus another four edges 
between the ﬁfth node and the other four), and ﬁve tetrahedral “faces” (namely the 
tetrahedra deﬁned by the nodesStartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 EndSet{1, 2, 3, 4},StartSet 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 EndSet{2, 3, 4, 5},StartSet 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma 1 EndSet{3, 4, 5, 1},StartSet 4 comma 5 comma 1 comma 2 EndSet{4, 5, 1, 2}, 
and StartSet 5 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSet{5, 1, 2, 3}). The inverse move, that is the 4-1 move, shrinks a tetrahedral 
cluster of 3-simplices down to a single node (i.e. a single 3-simplex). We are also 
led to consider the 3-2 move (or 2-3 move) in which three of the ﬁve vertices of 
a 4-simplex reside in one hypersurface, and the other two reside in the subsequent 
(or previous) hypersurface. These evolution moves are illustrated in Fig. 7.2a. It is 
1 We note that we are restricting the discussion somewhat here for the sake of simplicity. We 
recommend Sect. 1 of [ 1] as a good starting-point to investigate more deeply the details around 
deﬁning spin foams.

a spatial simplex (i.e. 3-simplex), but rather a tetrahedral cluster of spatial simplices, 
as illustrated in Fig. 7.2b. 
As was suggested above by the initial example of an identity spin foam, we can 
think of spin foams as mappings or operators 2 which act upon the kinematical states

implying a background manifold which is broken up into simplices, we are entitled to

7.1.1
Transition Amplitudes 
With a clear mental picture of spin foams in both 2+1 dimensions and 3+1 dimensions 
hopefully established, one can formally view a spin foam as a succession of states

and so on, wherescript upper H Subscript EHAHEHA is deﬁned in Eq. (5.3), with vertical bar normal upper Psi left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis right angle bracket|Ψ(t0)⟩as the initial state [ 2, 3]. 
At each node the Hamiltonian constraint acts to modify the geometry of the spin 
network according to the 2-to-2, 1-to-3, and 3-to-1 moves. 
Initial and ﬁnal spin network states can be viewed as describing conﬁgurations 
of the metric of initial and ﬁnal spacelike hypersurfaces forming the boundary of 
a spacetime manifold, left bracket g Subscript i Baseline right bracket[gi] and left bracket g Subscript f Baseline right bracket[gf]. As a result, the scalar product on the space of

is a quantity of particular interest. As this is a measure of how much an initial and 
ﬁnal state of geometry overlap, it would be expected to determine the amplitude 
for transition between initial and ﬁnal spatial metrics. In this expression we inte-
grate over the space of metrics up to diffeomorphism, which are consistent with the 
boundary conditions (i.e. left bracket g Subscript i Baseline right bracket[gi] and left bracket g Subscript f Baseline right bracket[gf]), with script upper PP being the projector on the kernel of 
the Hamiltonian constraint. 
It is the picture of spinfoams as operators, acting upon states which are spin 
networks, which connects to the sum-over-geometries concept invoked in Chap. 4. 
The action, and hence the weighting associated with the resultant geometries, is 
determined by the spin and intertwiner labels carried by the links and nodes. A 
particular spin foamscript upper FF is the entire complex of sheets extruded between the links of 
intermediate spin networks, the edges between sheets (extruded from nodes of spin 
networks), and the vertices where these meet. The initial and ﬁnal spin network states 
therefore constitute the boundary of script upper FF. But the piecewise linear cell complex of a 
spin foam is adorned with spins and intertwiners inherited from the spin networks 
it embodies. As a result, to each particular spin foam can be associated a transition 
amplitude of the form

As mentioned, each of these expressions is purely formal, and it is desirable to 
move beyond a formal view of spin foams, to make explicit calculations feasible. 
Naturally this is easier said than done, and new approaches continue to be developed. 
For the remainder of this chapter we will look at some of the historical and current 
efforts to address this task. 
7.2
Early Developments 
The ﬁrst topic we will look at, BF theory, is over twenty years old at the time of 
writing. In a sense then we are stepping backwards in time, before surveying newer 
developments which may be of greater interest to the modern reader. However this 
topic is noteworthy for establishing concepts and terminology which continue to be 
important in discussions of loop quantum gravity and spinfoams, and furthermore its 
mathematical formulation is intimately linked to the conceptual image of spin foams 
laid out in Sect. 7.1. 
The discussion of classical GR in Chap. 4 used the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian 
frameworks to motivate our deﬁnitions and concepts. Discussions of BF theory often 
involve the language of differential forms and exterior derivatives (Appendix B), and 
so a comparison between the discussions in Chap. 4 (involving indices on terms such 
as the connection and curvature) and the index-free notation of differential forms 
may also beneﬁt the reader by providing multiple perspectives. In particular this 
dovetails with the Palatini formulation which we covered in Sect. 4.3.5. Although 
not essential for the following discussion, the content of Appendix J provides a guide 
to some of the language and concepts frequently encountered in the wider literature 
on these topics. 
7.2.1
BF Theory 
BF theory has long been of interest as the three-dimensional version contains (2+1) 
general relativity, however for brevity we will concentrate on the four-dimensional 
case, in which we obtain (3+1) general relativity as a BF theory with extra constraints. 
By this point, the mention of constraints should give a hint as to where the discussion 
is leading. 
At the classical level we choose add-dimensional manifoldscript upper MM and a gauge group 
upper GG with an associated Lie algebraGerman gg. The theory involves two basic ﬁelds. The ﬁrst is 
a 1-formupper AA which we identify as a connection. The second is a left parenthesis d minus 2 right parenthesis(d − 2)-form which 
4 Other authors may refer to them as faces.

we denoteupper EE. In four dimensions this obviously makesupper EE a 2-form. Since the exterior 
derivative of akk-form is aleft parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis(k + 1)-form, the curvature ofupper AA is a 2-form which we refer 
to as upper FF. The choice of symbol here is intentionally reminiscent of the ﬁeld strength 
tensor upper F Subscript mu nuFμν, which we will recall embodied the curvature of the gauge ﬁeld upper A Subscript muAμ in 
quantum ﬁeld theory (as per Eqs. (3.15) and  (3.16)). In what follows we will make 
use ofd Subscript upper AdA, the exterior covariant derivative with respect to the connectionupper AA such that 
d Subscript upper A Baseline omega equals d omega plus upper A and omegadAω = dω + A ∧ ω, and recognise the curvature form as upper F equals d upper A plus upper A and upper AF = d A  + A ∧ A. This  
bears a clear resemblance to the form of the ﬁeld strength tensor given in Eq. (3.16). 
The relevant Lagrangian is obtained by taking the wedge product upper E and upper FE ∧ F, which  
deﬁnes add-form, i.e. a form having the same number of dimensions as the manifold 
script upper MM, and taking the trace 5 to obtain 
script upper L equals trace left parenthesis upper E and upper F right parenthesis periodL = Tr(E ∧ F) .
(7.4) 
Notice the similarity to the integrand of the Einstein-Hilbert action in the absence of 
matter, Eq. (4.64), where we have a curvature term given byupper R equals g Superscript mu nu Baseline upper R Subscript mu nuR = gμν Rμν, and recall 
that the curvature term in the BF action is a 2-form. The similarity here becomes 
even more pronounced when we recall the discussion of tetrads and their relationship 
to the metric in Sect. 4.3.2. The “extra constraints” mentioned above in fact refer to 
writing upper EE in terms of the tetrads. Speciﬁcally, if we require that upper E equals e and eE = e ∧ e we can 
view the upper EE as simple bivectors, corresponding to the triangular faces of tetrahedra, 
as described at the start of Sect. 6.3. As one would expect of a bivector, when the 
orientation of a face is reversed, the sign ofupper EE is reversed. We also require that these 
tetrahedra have non-zero volume, and that the four faces must meet up properly so 
that the tetrahedron is closed. The full list of these constraints can be found in [ 5], 
and as just mentioned, imposing them ensures that we obtain general relativity. The 
variation of the action obtained from Eq. 7.4 is zero when

(7.5) 
This result is to be expected in a theory of spacetime without matter—it simply says 
that the connection is ﬂat. We will notice that d Subscript upper A Baseline upper F equals 0dA F = 0 allows for transformations 
upper E right arrow upper E plus d Subscript upper A Baseline etaE → E + dAη, adding an appropriately-chosen derivative term to upper EE, which  result  
in physically equivalent solutions [ 4]. 
The classical phase space of BF theory is investigated by foliating spacetime, as 
was done in Sect. 4.2, so  that  script upper M equals normal upper Sigma times double struck upper RM = ∑× R. By a suitable choice of gauge the time 
component ofupper AA can be set to zero and we ﬁnd that the ﬁeldupper EE becomes the canonically 
conjugate momentum to upper AA, henceupper E equals partial differential script upper L divided by partial differential ModifyingAbove upper A With dotE = ∂L/∂ ˙A. The analogy with classical electro-
magnetism leads to upper EE being referred to as the electric ﬁeld in some instances (even 
though the student of quantum gravity may wonder what electric ﬁelds are doing in

a theory of dynamical spacetime). It is also responsible for the naming of the Gauss 
constraint (ﬁrst mentioned in Sect. 4.2.1), as the condition d Subscript upper A Baseline upper E equals 0dA E = 0 is reminiscent 
of Gauss’ law from classical electromagnetism in the absence of charges. 6 
Based upon BF theory Barrett and Crane [ 5] developed, with notable contribu-
tions from Baez, a model of spacetime dynamics which is closely related to spin 
foams. In this model the spin networks are labelled by representations of SO(4) (or 
SU(2)times×SU(2)), and the tetrahedral 3-simplices extrude into 4-simplices, exactly as 
we have already discussed. The choice of SO(4) was determined by the desire to shift 
from a three-dimensional description of spacetime, i.e. (2+1) general relativity, to a 
four-dimensional description. It was realised [ 6] that this model could be interpreted 
in terms of a Feynman graph of a class of theories that came to be known as group 
ﬁeld theories, to which we will turn in Sect. 7.3.3. However, the model is not identical 
to loop quantum gravity [ 7], and so we will mention it for historical context, but not 
dwell on it. 
7.2.2
Chern–Simons Theory 
The image we have built up in the previous sections is of the conﬁgurations of 
simplices (or the appropriate dual cell-complexes) as a kind of Feynman diagram for 
spacetime structure. Correspondingly, we expect a transition between an initial spin 
network state and a ﬁnal spin network state to involve sums over the appropriately 
weighted intermediate spin foams. We naturally want the sum over spin foams to be 
triangulation independent, and we can be conﬁdent this is the case if we can relate 
the triangulations to some set of topological invariants. 
Frequently when summing over intermediate states in quantum ﬁeld theory, we 
encounter divergences which must be tamed somehow. Similarly, when summing 
over spin foam states we encounter divergences. Roughly speaking, the sheets of 
the spin foam (being extruded from links in a spin network) are labelled by spins. 
Naively the sum over possible spin foams can include arbitrarily large spins, leading 
to transition amplitudes which diverge. What we would like, then, is a way to limit the 
permissible spin values so that the sum-over-geometries does not diverge. Fortunately 
in BF theory there is a way to do this, by adding extra terms to the Lagrangian. 
In the three-dimensional case the BF action is written in terms of upper EE, upper FF, and  a

In this case spacetime is no longer ﬂat—upper FF becomes non-zero. 
To see why this is an effective way of eliminating divergences we will need 
to digress again, to talk about Chern–Simons theory (which is also discussed in 
Appendix G). This is a background-free gauge theory, originally formulated in three 
dimensions, with action

In fact, Chern–Simons theory is a topological ﬁeld theory, meaning the observables 
of the theory tell us about the topological invariants of spacetime itself. The action 
upper S Subscript CSSCS is (perhaps unsurprisingly, then) a topological invariant. 
If we deﬁne two connections 
upper A Subscript plus or minus Baseline equals upper A plus or minus beta upper EA± = A ± β E
(7.9) 
then the BF action can be written as the difference of two Chern–Simons actions,

(7.10) 
by appropriate choices of betaβ and kk, and so if we can induce a cutoff for spin values 
in Chern–Simons theory, we should achieve the same for BF theory. The quantitykk 
is referred to as the Chern–Simons level, and will play an important role in taming 
the divergences that have motivated these steps. 
In the Abelian case the wedge product upper A and upper A and upper AA ∧ A ∧ A in Eq. (7.8), which we can 
think of a self-interaction term for the connection, is zero and so we are left with the 
leading upper A and d upper FA ∧ dF term only, corresponding to a ﬂat connection, which we looked at 
in Sect. 7.2.1. 
The non-Abelian case corresponds to non-zero self-interactions, and results in 
the upper E and upper E and upper EE ∧ E ∧ E term in the BF action. The coupling strength is written as normal upper Lamdaᴧ, since  
it is generally identiﬁed with a cosmological constant, which we can think of as 
representing the energy density of empty space. The introduction of this cosmological 
constant term leads to a modiﬁcation of the spin networks we have by now come 
to know and (presumably) love, such that they may be visualised as networks of 
ribbons. It would be a signiﬁcant digression to explain the details properly, and so 
we will provide below a conceptual outline of the reasoning which brings us to this 
view. For more details we recommend the reader consults [ 8, 9].

The Cosmological Constant 
In discussing BF theory above it was mentioned that gauge transformations were 
possible, and involved adding an appropriate derivative term to upper EE. Working with 
explicit indices again, to emphasise the similarity to the discussion in Sect. 3.1, it  is  
natural to ask whether the action Eq. (7.8) is invariant under gauge transformations,

(7.11) 
(notice the similarity here to Eq. (3.5), though with a slight change in notation). It 
is here that we must address the concept of winding numbers. Consider a mapping 
f left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i theta f (θ ) = eiθ . Clearly this is a mapping from the circle to itself,f colon upper S Superscript 1 Baseline right arrow upper S Superscript 1 f : S1 → S1. We can

case the mapping windsww times around the circle, andww is referred to as the winding 
number of the mapping. We can also deﬁne a function f Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i left parenthesis w theta plus a theta 0 right parenthesis fa(θ ) = ei(wθ +aθ0). Setting 
a equals 0a = 0 yields f 0 left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i left parenthesis w theta right parenthesis f0(θ ) = ei(wθ ), while setting a equals 1a = 1 yields another mapping with the 
same winding number, f 1 left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i left parenthesis w theta plus theta 0 right parenthesis f1(θ ) = ei(wθ+θ0). Varying the value of aa generates a class 
of mappings between f 0 f0 and f 1 f1 with the same winding number. Such a class of 
mappings that can be smoothly deformed into each other is called a homotopy class. 
What does this have to do with gauge transformations? We can readily identify 
the mappingsf Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i w theta plus a fa(θ ) = eiwθ+a as U(1) transformations. It is not difﬁcult to generalise 
to other groups, such as SU(2), as we did in Eq. (3.13). We will refer to the relevant 
transformations as gg, as  per  Eq.  (7.11). In the case of SU(2) this is equivalent to a 
mapping g colon upper S cubed right arrow upper S cubedg : S3 → S3, as a Euclidean nn-dimensional space with points at inﬁnity 
identiﬁed is equivalent to an nn-sphere (the ﬁrst upper S cubedS3), while the group manifold of 
SU(2) is the secondupper S cubedS3. 
Applying the gauge transformation above to upper A Subscript muAμ and taking the variation of the 
Chern–Simons action we obtain a sum of two terms

The second term is actually proportional to the winding numberww associated to the 
gauge transformation. As mentioned above, these kinds of mappings can be assigned 
to distinct homotopy classes. Since gauge transformations associate a group element 
g element of upper Gg ∈ G with each point, x right arrow from bar g left parenthesis x right parenthesisx |→ g(x ), one possible gauge transformation is the map-
ping to the identity element. This leads to a distinction between mappings that can be 
connected to the identity, and those that cannot. A transformation corresponding to 
anything less than a full rotation has a winding number of zero and can be deformed to 
no winding. These are generally called ‘small’ gauge transformations. Transforma-
tions corresponding to a full rotation, or several full rotations, have non-zero winding 
number and cannot be smoothly deformed to the identity. These are referred to as 
‘large’ gauge transformations. Thus the winding number is a characteristic of gauge

must be gauge-invariant, and hence so are the VEVs themselves. 
The simplest observables we can calculate are Wilson loops. 7 A Wilson loop 
corresponds to a closed curvelamdaλ, which as already discussed can be used to probe the 
amount of curvature of a gauge ﬁeld. Now consider a collection ofrr non-intersecting, 
closed curves, and endow each closed curve with an orientation, i.e. a preferred 
direction, which can be thought of as consistent set of vectors tangent to the curve 
at each point. The union of these closed curves will be referred to as a link, upper LL. The  
closed curves in this link may interconnect with each other, and each closed curve 
may pass around and through itself forming a knot. There are a number of quantities 
that can be used to characterise links and knots, which we discuss in Appendix K. 
The product of Wilson loops is referred to as a Wilson link, upper W left bracket upper L right bracketW[L]. Working in 
the Abelian case for simplicity of illustration, the expectation value of a Wilson link 
is (see [ 9])

is an integer which counts the number of times one closed curve winds through 
the other. This linking number can be related to the ﬂux linking associated with 
electromagnetism, if we think of one closed curve as a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines,

derived from but also displaced from lamdaλ.  To do this  we “frame”  lamdaλ, which is to say 
we assign a vector to every point of lamdaλ, and let the tips of these vectors be the points

with some ﬁnite width between its “left” and “right” sides (see Fig. 7.3). 
We then treat these edges as separate knots. The problematic self-linking number 
normal upper Phi left bracket lamda right bracketΦ[λ] is then replaced by the linking numbernormal upper Phi left bracket lamda comma lamda prime right bracketΦ[λ, λ']. Of course, to ensure thatlamdaλ and 
lamda primeλ' are truly distinct, the resulting ribbon deﬁned between them must be an orientable 
surface, and hence their crossings must result in twists that are integer multiples 
of 2 pi2π . 
This framing of curves, when applied to a spin network, turns each link into a 
ribbon and each node into a disk. The unframed (i.e.normal upper Lamda equals 0ᴧ= 0) spin networks could be 
analysed combinatorially using skein relations (see Appendix K) which embodied the 
representation theory of the groupupper GG determining the link labels. The extra framing 
in the normal upper Lamda not equals 0ᴧ/= 0 case depends on an extra parameter 
q equals exp left parenthesis StartFraction bold i Baseline 2 pi Over k plus h EndFraction right parenthesisq = exp
( i2π

)
(7.16) 
where h equals 2h = 2 in the SU(2) case. It should be noted that when we work in the spin-
one half 1 
2 representation of SU(2) we ﬁnd that the linking number of a Wilson link is the 
Kauffman bracket (Appendix K) evaluated with 
upper A Superscript 4 Baseline equals q equals exp left parenthesis StartFraction bold i Baseline 2 pi Over k plus 2 EndFraction right parenthesisA4 = q = exp

(7.17) 
where in this case upper AA is a speciﬁc parameter of the Kauffman bracket, not to be 
confused with upper A Subscript muAμ. 
We can view qq as a deformation parameter, related to the framing of the spin 
networks. Now the relevant skein relations encode a labelling by representations of 
a qq-deformed group USubscript q Baseline left parenthesis German g right parenthesisq (g) (also frequently called a “quantum group”). Despite the 
name, these are actually not groups, but rather U(German gg) is the enveloping algebra 8 of 
the algebra German gg, and  USubscript q Baseline left parenthesis German g right parenthesisq (g) is the enveloping algebra “deformed” by the parameter qq. 
8 The basics of group theory and algebras are covered in Appendix A.1 but the reader in need of 
a more detailed discussion may consult the wikipedia article ‘Universal enveloping algebra’, Sect. 
9.3 of [ 10], etc.

Dynamics of Spin Networks 
Such objects are a substantial subject in their own right, but we have attempted to 
address them brieﬂy in Appendix L. 
This construction achieves our stated goal of eliminating divergences. Writing BF 
theory in terms of Chern–Simons theory means we arrive at a version of spin networks 
and spin foams in which the labellings by representations of a group are replaced 
by representations of the correspondingqq-deformed group. Similarly the labellings 
by intertwiners in terms of representations are replaced by intertwiners deﬁned in 
terms of the qq-deformed group’s representations. In this case only representations

values associated to faces. 
7.3
Some Recent Developments 
Attempts to convert the conceptual view of spin foams, embodied in Eq. (7.1) 
into practical, tractable calculations require great ingenuity. Much effort has been 
expended on developing such calculations, a full discussion of which is beyond the 
scope of this book. But a common feature of such efforts centres upon choosing 
labelling schemes for the links and nodes in a spin network, and hence the associ-
ated faces, edges, and vertices of a spin foam. We have already seen in the case of 
BF theory and the development of loop quantum gravity that different choices of 
gauge group are possible, guided by the desire for computational ease and physical 
plausibility. In a similar fashion, labelling the elements of spin networks and spin 
foams by group representations, tensors, etc. has led to a number of interesting ideas 
and avenues for further research. We provide here a brief survey to whet the reader’s 
appetite for their own investigations. We will start by discussing a very general con-
cept, that of tensor networks, which hints at connections between quantum gravity, 
topology, and quantum computing, amongst other concepts, before reviewing some 
recent and more speciﬁc work by various authors. 
7.3.1
Tensor Networks 
We are all familiar with the idea of contracting tensor indices. In the case of a tensor 
acting on a vector, covector, or another tensor, we think of this as the action of a 
mapping from the space of objects being acted upon to construct a new mapping 
or quantity (e.g. the inner product). In many applications we can regard a series of 
operations as tensors themselves. The logic gates in a computer circuit, for example, 
behave like simple tensors, and composing several of these together can produce quite 
complex evaluations of the inputs provided to the circuit. Of course, a computer 
circuit can also be interpreted as a type of graph, with junctions and logic gates 
acting as hubs (to use the terminology we adopted in Sect. 6.1). It therefore becomes 
possible to view a series of tensors related by index contractions, a circuit, and a 
graph with appropriately labelled tracks and hubs as different versions of the same 
type of structure. That structure is what we mean when we refer to a tensor network.

Fig. 7.4 Contraction of tensor indices using Penrose’s graphical notation. On the top row we see 
two tensors (staggering of the indices has been suppressed to save space), and the product formed 
by two contractions between them. Different versions of the Kronecker delta, and a trace formed 
by contracting an upper and lower index on the same tensor are shown on the bottom row 
Visualising interrelated tensors as forming a network becomes more intuitive 
when we employ a graphical notation due to Penrose [ 11]. In this notation a tensor 
with nn raised indices and mm lowered indices is drawn as a box or shape with nn lines 
emerging from the top andmm lines emerging from the bottom. Contractions between 
tensors are then represented by joining a line attached to the top of one box with a 
line attached to the bottom of another box (or possibly the same box), as illustrated 
in Fig. 7.4. Contraction of an upper index and a lower index reduces the number of 
‘free’ lines in the diagram by exactly two. In this notation a scalar has no indices 
and hence no lines emerging from it, so if a tensor has one upper index (line) and 
one lower index (line) the contraction (joining) of the two gives a scalar—the trace 
of the tensor in question. 
Various tensors of interest can be represented in this notation—for example the 
Kronecker delta is simply an unadorned line, either vertical, or with open ends point-
ing up or down (depending on whether it has mixed, raised, or lowered indices.) This 
is consistent with the way the Kronecker delta serves (in the summation convention) 
to equate indices, e.g. upper T Superscript a b Baseline delta Subscript a Superscript c Baseline upper U Subscript c Superscript d Baseline equals upper T Superscript a b Baseline upper U Subscript a Superscript dT abδc 
aUd 
c = T abUd 
a , and hence acts like (in the graphical 
notation) a line between the relevant tensors. 
A symbol with a single upwards or downwards line stands in for a quantity with 
a single raised or lowered index—such as a vector with components v Superscript ava or a dual 
vector with components u Subscript bub. In the standard way we can think of a tensor with pp 
raised indices and qq lowered indices as being the tensor product of pp vectors and qq 
dual vectors, e.g.upper T Subscript c Superscript a b Baseline equals v Superscript a Baseline circled times w Superscript b Baseline circled times u Subscript cT ab 
c = va ⊗ wb ⊗ uc. If the vectors and dual vectors are elements 
of the representation spaceupper VV and dual representation spaceupper V Superscript asteriskV ∗ of some groupupper GG then 
we can view these composite tensors with pp raised indices andqq lowered indices as

Further discussion of this notation can be found in [ 11,12], and several informative 
reviews (especially for those with an interest in quantum information and quantum 
computing) can be found in [ 13,14]. A very thorough discussion of the use of network 
diagrams to perform calculations involving coupling of spins, as discussed in Chap. 6, 
can be found in [ 15]. 
7.3.2
Spinorial LQG and Coherent States 
We have at great length discussed the assignment of a representation of a group to the 
links in a spin network. We have also seen in Chap. 3 how holonomies correspond 
with the transport of spinors along a path. The spinorial formulation of LQG pro-
motes the importance of this idea, labelling either end of each link in a spin network 
with a spinor indouble struck upper C squaredC2. This implies that the nodes are then labelled by several spinors, 
the number of spinors being equal to the valency of the node [ 16]. In this view the 
labelling by spinors is more fundamental, and any labelling of links by representa-
tions and nodes by intertwiners is derived from the spinors. Since the components of 
a spinor are complex numbers this approach has great promise to simplify calcula-
tions, by converting calculations involving representation theory into comparatively 
straightforward matters of complex analysis.

The interpretation of ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow →X as the normal vector to a face implies a matching con-
straint. When two simplices are joined, pairing a face on one simplex with a face on 
the other, we expect the faces to have the same area. Using the idea that vertical bar zeta right angle bracket|ζ⟩and vertical bar xi right angle bracket|ξ⟩
are the spinors on opposite ends of the link passing between (i.e. dual to) these two 
faces, and the relationship between components of a null vector, we can write the

A further constraint implied by the normal vectors ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow →X arises from the fact that an 
nn-valent node will have nn spinors associated to it. This constraint, which may be 
written

can be interpreted as a requirement that the normal vectors sum to zero, or in other 
words the associated faces join together to form a closed simplex. Hence this is a 
closure constraint. 
In [ 16– 18] the labelling of nn-valent nodes by spinors was used to investigate 
spatial simplices beyond the tetrahedra we have discussed so far. This generalisation 
carried over to polyhedra withnn faces (with the restriction that exactly three faces met 
at a vertex). 10 In this polyhedral view of loop quantum gravity each spatial simplex 
is dual to a vertex labelled by an intertwiner carrying an irreducible representation 
of U(nn). 
It was already mentioned in Sect. 6.4 that tetrahedral simplices are not uniquely 
deﬁned by the area of their faces. This admits an invariance under area-preserving 
diffeomorphisms of the simplices. 
In the case of polyhedral simplices, it is possible to construct operators which 
increase and decrease surface area. These are essentially raising and lowering oper-
ators, exactly as we would expect in the case of harmonic oscillators, and are related 
to the interpretation of spin (angular momentum) labels determining the area of a 
face dual to a line carrying that label. Consider commutator relations for a pair of 
uncoupled harmonic oscillators,

The fact that we have operators that create and annihilate units of surface area of the 
polyhedra means we can think of a Fock space, with a vacuum state vertical bar 0 right parenthesis|0). The use of 
a rounded ket (or bra) indicates a coherent state. The creation operators in Eq. (7.37) 
can then act upon the vacuum to create coherent states vertical bar bold italic upper J comma zeta Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis|J, ζi ), wherebold italic upper JJ is an integer 
equal to the area of the relevant face (which we denote in bold, consistent with the 
spin-area equivalence established in Chap. 6). The inner product of coherent states 
is found to be a straightforward power of the area, thus

Coherent states [ 19] are generally “well-behaved” under transformations, and can 
be thought of as states of minimal uncertainty, i.e. states for which the uncertainty 
principle yields an equality, rather than an inequality. One would hope then that 
they would shed light on the semi-classical limit of the theory. It turns out [ 16] that  
the coherent states are obtained by the action of U(upper NN) on states corresponding to 
polyhedra (or nodes in the dual spin network in which all but two of the labelling 
spinors are zero.) To think of this process as creating arbitrary-valency nodes out of 
the vacuum makes intuitive sense, as an arrangement of two links meeting at such a 
bivalent node is equivalent to a single link with no node at all (i.e. the spin on one side 
of the “node” must equal the spin on the other side to conserve angular momentum,

to itself 
and so the associated intertwiner must simply be the identity.) The machinery thus 
developed makes it possible to evaluate expectation values of operators deﬁned from 
Eq. (7.34). It is found that the mean values grow faster than the uncertainties as 
upper J right arrow normal infinityJ →∞, showing that these coherent states peak as upper JJ becomes large. 
Up until now we have been talking about individual spatial simplices. So let us 
step back to review some work [ 20] in which the spinorial approach to LQG is extend 
to cover the case of gluing simplices together to form spin networks, with a view to 
discussing spin foams. We begin by considering the simple case of a Wilson loop 
with both ends connecting to the same 2-valent node, as depicted in Fig. 7.5. 11 
Then as in Eq. (3.30) the loop holonomy is constructed and its trace taken to obtain

This is ﬁne for a description of the classical phase space, requiring simplices to 
be closed and ﬂat, and for any curvature in the spacetime they triangulate to occur at 
the edges between simplices, just as was described in the toy model of Sect. 6.1. The  
upper F Subscript i jFij and their extension to the case of multi-node networks are classical quantities. 
The quantisation of this picture associates a Hilbert spacescript upper H Subscript normal upper GammaH⎡to the spin network 
which is dual to this triangulation, as per Eq. (6.11). The question then arises as to 
whetherscript upper H Subscript normal upper Gamma Superscript spinHspin

, the Hilbert space we would construct for a network with links labelled 
by pairs of spinors, corresponds withscript upper H Subscript normal upper GammaH⎡. In [  20] a mapping was constructed between 
the Hilbert space of a single link labelled by a spin, and a single link labelled by pairs 
of spinors. This mapping was then extended to networks with an arbitrary number 
of nodes and links.

case of the Fock vacuum, but still serves to introduce a simple version of some results which will

where we now invoke two complex numbersz 0z0,z 1z1 corresponding to the two complex 
components of a spinor. Equation (7.40) illustrates the connection between familiar 
notation in terms of total and magnetic quantum numbers (withbold italic j j taking half-integer 
values and mm taking values between plus or minus bold italic j± j) and points left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis(x, y) where x comma yx , y are natural

This allows the construction of the Hilbert space for a link labelled by a spinor at 
either end. It is given by two copies of the space of functions for a spinor, however 
we must take into account the matching constraint which as we have seen generates 
U(1) gauge transformations. Hence the Hilbert space for a link is identiﬁed as 
script upper H Subscript l Superscript spin Baseline equals left parenthesis script upper U 2 times script upper U 2 right parenthesis divided by normal upper U left parenthesis 1 right parenthesisHspin

m2 (one might expect the occurrence of two 
different values, bold italic j 1 j1 and bold italic j 2 j2, however it can be shown that all states with bold italic j 1 not equals bold italic j 2 j1 /= j2 
vanish). 
The Hilbert space of an individual link does not pay attention to the SU(2) gauge 
transformations that may be applied to thenn spinors labelling annn-valent node. The 
transition to considering the Hilbert space of entire networks labelled by spinors 
can be achieved by constructing SU(2) invariant functions corresponding to nodes, 
and connect these in such a way as to fulﬁll the U(1) invariance required by the 
matching constraint on each link between nodes. It turns out that, fornn-valent nodes, 
polynomials in the variablesupper F Subscript i jFij deﬁned in Eq. (7.36) are elements ofscript upper U 2 Superscript circled times nU⊗n 
2 , and hence 
can be used (nodewise) to construct functions of the spin networks, extending the 
result of Eq. (7.39). Speciﬁc details can be found in [ 20], but the basic result is that 
functions of the upper F Subscript i jFij are much easier to work with than expressions involving SU(2) 
recoupling theory applied to the intertwiners labelling spin network nodes. 
7.3.3
Group Field Theory 
Up to this point our ideas of spin networks, and spin foams, have had a fairly simple 
form which (if technically challenging) is at least intuitively simple; choose a base 
manifold which we can think of as similar if not identical to double struck upper R Superscript upper NRN , embed  a  graph  in  
that manifold, label the tracks and hubs of the graph, and ultimately consider only the 
labelled graph so that the base manifold becomes superﬂuous. In group ﬁeld theory 
[ 21] the base manifold is instead taken to be the group manifold of a Lie group. 
This means that points in the manifold are no longer explicitly positions in some 
version of space (or spacetime), but group elements deﬁned by particular choices of 
parameters. 
To explore this idea, let us deﬁne a ﬁeld phiφ which is a mapping from dd copies of 
a Lie group manifold to the complex numbers 
phi colon upper G Superscript d Baseline right arrow double struck upper Cφ : Gd → C

where the upper U left parenthesis g prime Subscript i Baseline comma g Subscript i Baseline right parenthesisU (g'

the Schwinger line integral terms which we encountered in Eq. (3.26). These terms 
were identiﬁed as gauge rotations, and so in this case the upper UU are mappings between 
StartSet g Subscript i Baseline EndSet{gi} and StartSet g prime Subscript i EndSet{g'
i}. Consequently we can view phiφ as a tensor transforming under dd copies 
of the groupupper UU, where  the StartSet g Subscript i Baseline EndSet{gi} are the tensor index labels.

We can give a physical meaning to the integrand of Eq. (7.53) by reference to 
a series of graph diagrams [ 6]. We will use the hub-track terminology for abstract 
graphs, but very shortly see how these diagrams relate to simplices and spin networks. 
To start, representphiφ as a tetravalent hub. Note that in general we will consider several 
hubs labelled by ii, explaining the notation g Subscript i jgij used above, as referring to track j j 
attached to hubii. As we are only considering one hub (for the moment) we simplify 
the indices accordingly. We therefore label the four tracks of the hubg 1 comma ellipsis g 4g1,  . . .  g4, as  in  
Fig. 7.6, and write phi left parenthesis g Subscript j Baseline right parenthesis equals phi left parenthesis g 1 comma g 2 comma g 3 comma g 4 right parenthesisφ(g j ) = φ(g1, g2, g3, g4). A consequence of the simpliﬁcation 
of indices is that the graph diagrams that will now be introduced are also simpliﬁed. 
This will be rectiﬁed shortly. 
For the moment, recall the discussion in Sect. 7.3.1, in which we consider the 
joining of lines to be equivalent to contraction of indices. Setting the indices of two

obtain, for instance,upper F Superscript mu nu Baseline upper F Subscript mu nu Baseline equals upper F squaredFμν Fμν = F2. Diagramatically we can view this as taking two

with kk (not to be confused with the Chern–Simons level of Sect. 7.2.2) standing in 
for pairs ofi comma ji , j values. These values ofkk correspond to the ten edges of a 4-simplex, 
with the ﬁve hubs corresponding to its vertices, as described in Sect. 7.1. Performing 
the contractions between phi Subscript upper A Baseline commaφA, phi Subscript upper B Baseline commaφB , phi Subscript upper C Baseline commaφC , phi Subscript upper D Baseline commaφD, phi Subscript upper EφE we obtain a diagram as in Fig. 7.8. 
Examining the resultant connections and identifyingg Subscript i jgij as the group element which 
labels the edge connecting vertex ii with vertexj j, we see that the indices associated 
to each hub are as given in Eqs. (7.54a)–(7.54e).

Some Recent Developments

Fig. 7.9 Contraction of . φ tensors in two (left), three (middle), and four dimensions. In the two-
dimensional case each. φ has two lines running through it, and corresponds to a linear face—in blue— 
of a 2-simplex (a triangle). In three dimensions has three lines run through each . φ, corresponding 
to a triangular face of a 3-simplex (a tetrahedron). The tetrahedral faces of the 4-simplex (right) are 
omitted for clarity, but a quick comparison shows that Fig. 7.8 is the same diagram with “external” 
lines omitted 
Now it is tempting to identify the ﬁve hubs in Eqs. (7.54a)–(7.54e) as vertices of a 
volume simplex in four dimensions. We can understand the potential term Eq. (7.53) 
as being based on the structure of such simplices. However, we should actually 
recognise that the phiφ can be associated with four lines (and so four of the tracks per 
hub have been suppressed so far, just as we suppressed one index on g Subscript i jgij above.) So 
we should think of each hub as a tetrahedral face of a 4-simplex, and think of g Subscript i jgij as 
representing the line running through faces ii andj j. This conception is illustrated in 
Fig. 7.9, in two, three, and four dimensions. Likewise, the coupling of two phiφ factors 
in the kinetic part of the action, as illustrated in Fig. 7.7, should be thought of as a 
set of four lines passing into and through one phiφ, through the next phiφ and continuing 
out the other side. 
This leaves us with a scheme that can very easily be viewed as a Feynman diagram 
for interactions between an initial spin network state and a ﬁnal state. We can there-
fore conceive of performing a perturbative sum over all topologies and geometries 
of the simplices. In this way we connect up to the concept of a path integral over 
ﬁeld conﬁgurations involving a perturbative sum of interaction terms described by 
Feynman diagrams, as outlined in Sect. 3.4. This in turn should enable the calcula-
tion of the transition amplitudes mentioned above. For further details, the reader is 
recommended to consult the reviews [ 22,23]. Other interesting reviews of the spin 
foam formalism and group ﬁeld theory include [ 24,25]. 
The time has come to move on from our survey of approaches to the quantum 
dynamics of spacetime. In each case the goal has been to construct something recog-
nisable as a path integral formulation of the structure of spacetime, in other words, 
the sum-over-histories for our quantum version of general relativity. Hopefully this 
discussion has set the stage for the reader to explore these concepts on their own. 
We now turn to looking at some applications of the ideas we have covered so far.

Applications 
Ultimately, the value of any theory is judged by its relevance for the real world. 
Unfortunately, due to the small length scales involved, direct tests of models of 
quantum gravity are not easy to perform. However one can try to reproduce well-
known results from other physical theories as a preliminary consistency test for newer 
theories. In this section, we will consider how LQG can be applied to the calculation 
of black hole entropy, and cosmological models. 
While the question of black hole entropy is, as yet, an abstract problem, it is 
concrete enough to serve as a test-bed for theories of quantum gravity. In addition 
to the Bekenstein area law (mentioned in Chap. 1), by investigating the behavior of 
a scalar ﬁeld in the curved background geometry near a black hole horizon it was 
determined [ 1] that all black holes behave as almost perfect black bodies radiating 
at a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, upper T proportional to 1 divided by upper M Subscript BHT ∝ 1/MBH. 
This thermal ﬂux is named Hawking radiation after its discoverer. These properties 
of a black hole turn out to be completely independent of the nature and constitution 
of the matter which underwent gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the 
ﬁrst place. These developments led to the understanding that a macroscopic black 
hole, at equilibrium, can be described as a thermal system characterized solely by 
its mass, charge and angular momentum. 
Bekenstein’s result has a deep implications for any theory of quantum gravity. 
The “Bekenstein bound” refers to the fact that Eq. (1.1) is the maximum number of 
degrees of freedom—of both, geometry and matter–that can lie within any region 
of spacetime of a given volume upper VV . The argument is straightforward [ 2]. Consider 
a region of volume upper VV whose entropy is greater than that of a black hole which 
would ﬁt inside the given volume. If we add additional matter to the volume, we will 
eventually trigger gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a black hole, 
whose entropy will be less than the entropy of the region was initially. However, 
such a process would violate the second law of thermodynamics and therefore the 
entropy of a given volume must be at a maximum when that volume is occupied 
by a black hole. And since the entropy of a black hole is contained entirely on its

that would be required to describe the physics in a given region of spacetime script upper MM, in  
any theory of quantum gravity, scales not as the volume of the regionupper V left parenthesis script upper M right parenthesisV (M), but as 
the area of its boundary [ 2, 3] upper N Subscript max Baseline proportional to upper A left parenthesis partial differential script upper M right parenthesisNmax ∝ A(∂M). 
In view of the independence of the Bekenstein entropy on the matter content of 
the black hole, the origin of Eq. (1.1) must be sought in the properties of the horizon 
geometry. Assuming that at the Planck scale, geometrical observables such as area 
are quantized such that there is a minimum possible area element a 0a0 that the black 
hole horizon, or any surface for that matter, can be “cut up into”, Eq. (1.1) can be 
seen as arising from the number of ways that one can put (or “sew”) together upper NN 
quanta of area to form a horizon of area upper A equals k upper N a 0A = kNa0, where kk is a constant. In this 
manner, understanding the thermal properties of a black hole leads us to profound 
conclusions: 
1. In a theory of quantum gravity the physics within a given volume of spacetimescript upper MM 
is completely determined by the values of ﬁelds on the boundary of that region 
partial differential script upper M∂M. This is the statement of the holographic principle. 
2. At the Planck scale (or at whichever scale quantum gravitational effects become 
relevant) spacetime ceases to be a smooth and continuous entity, i.e. geometric 
observables are quantized. 
In LQG, the second feature arises naturally—though not all theorists are convinced 
that geometry should be “quantized” or that LQG is the right way to do so. One can 
also argue on general grounds that the ﬁrst feature—holography—is also present in 
LQG, though this has not been demonstrated in a conclusive manner. Perhaps this 
book might motivate some of its readers to close this gap! 
Let us now review the black hole entropy calculation in the framework of LQG. 
8.1
Black Hole Entropy 
The ideas of quantum geometry allow us to give a statistical mechanical description 
of a black hole horizon. This is analogous to the statistical mechanical description 
of entropy for a gas, or some other system composed of many smaller parts, and is 
related to the concept, mentioned above, that the horizon of a black hole can be cut 
up into small area elements. Just as a gas in classical thermodynamics can have a 
macrostate deﬁned by its pressure, temperature, etc. and microstates deﬁned by the 
positions and momenta of its constituent molecules, we are led to the idea that a 
black hole can have macrostates deﬁned by mass, charge, and angular momentum, 
and microstates deﬁned by the properties of the area elements its boundary has been 
subdivided into. 
In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system,upper SS, was related to the number 
of microstates, normal upper OmegaΩ, by Boltzmann by the formula 
upper S equals k Subscript upper B Baseline ln normal upper OmegaS = kB ln Ω
(8.1)

For a proof that the logarithmic deﬁnitions of entropy provided by Boltzmann and 
Gibbs correspond to the thermodynamic deﬁnition usually encountered ﬁrst in under-
graduate courses, 
normal d upper S greater than or equals StartFraction normal d upper Q Over upper T EndFractiondS ≥ dQ 
T 
(8.3) 
the reader is referred to [ 4]. 
It is perhaps worth taking a small digression to discuss these microstate-based 
equations in more detail, since they suggest that the entropy of a black hole can indeed 
be calculated by reference to the microstates of quantum geometry at its boundary. 
Many discussions of entropy quote the result that it is a logarithmic function of the 
number of microstates,normal upper OmegaΩ but a clear-cut explanation of why can be hard to come by. 
Indeed the formula 
upper S equals k Subscript upper B Baseline ln normal upper OmegaS = kB ln Ω
is often “dropped in” to discussions and derivations alike, and explained (if at all) by 
saying that it turns a large number (the number of microstates) into a smaller, more 
manageable number, and that it has the correct properties to describe the disorder of 
a physical system. 1 This may seem half-hearted and unsatisfying to many readers 
(it certainly does to the author), so in Appendix M a discussion is provided which is, 
if not entirely devoid of hand-waving, at least somewhat less vague. This discussion 
is largely based on Shannon’s work on entropy in the context of information theory 
[ 5]. 
In general there are two ways to calculate the entropy associated with a given 
random variable xx: 
1. Using Shannon’s formula. Let us say that we sample our random variable from 
some given ensemble, from which we draw upper NN samples. The variable xx takes 
values in the set StartSet x Subscript i Baseline EndSet{xi} where i equals 1 comma 2 comma ellipsis ni = 1, 2, . . .  n. Then the entropy associated with our 
lack of knowledge of the variable xx is given by 
upper S left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts p left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis ln p left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesisS(x) = − 
n
∑
i=1 
p(xi ) ln p(xi )
(8.4) 
1 For instance if you combine two systems with entropyupper S 1S1 andupper S 2S2, the resulting system has entropy 
upper S equals upper S 1 plus upper S 2S = S1 + S2. This is not an entirely trivial or universal property, since if you combine two systems 
at temperaturesupper T 1T1 andupper T 2T2, the resulting system does not attain a temperatureupper T equals upper T 1 plus upper T 2T = T1 + T2.

where p left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesisp(xi ) is the probability that the random variable takes on the value x Subscript ixi . If  
in the upper NN samples on which the entropy is based, the i thith value x Subscript ixi occurs k Subscript iki times 
(with the constraint thatsigma summation Underscript i Endscripts k Subscript i Baseline equals upper N∑
i ki = N), then we have the usual frequentist deﬁnition 
for the probability associated with that value, 
p left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals StartFraction k Subscript i Baseline Over upper N EndFraction periodp(xi ) = ki

The deﬁnition of the Shannon entropy (8.4) is equivalent to the deﬁnition of the 
Gibbs entropy in statistical mechanics. 
2. Using the statistical mechanics method, or its more general version, Jaynes’ for-
malism [ 4]. This is based on the maximum entropy principle, according to which, 
in the absence of any prior information about a given random variable the least 
unbiased assumption one can make is that the variable satisﬁes a probability 
distribution which possesses the maximum possible entropy. This assumption 
leads us to the usual Boltzmann form of the probability. For a given value of the 
random variable x Subscript ixi , the associated probability distribution must satisfy the max-
imum entropy criterion (wherein (8.4) is maximized) and also the usual axioms 
of probability theory p left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals StartFraction k Subscript i Baseline Over upper N EndFraction period

In the case of quantum geometry, the microstates correspond with the assignments 
of area to the discrete “pieces” of a surface (such as the event horizon of a black 
hole). Hence for each macroscopic interval of area in the range left bracket upper A plus delta upper A comma upper A minus delta upper A right bracket[A + δ A, A − δ A], 
entropyupper SS is proportional to the log of the number of ways in which we can puncture 
the sphere to yield an area within that interval (Fig. 8.1).

In addition to (8.10) the integers StartSet k Subscript upper I Baseline EndSet{kI} must also satisfy a so-called projection

The task at hand is the following; given an interval left bracket upper A plus delta upper A comma upper A minus delta upper A right bracket[A + δ A, A − δ A], where 
upper AA is a macroscopic area value and delta upper Aδ A is some small interval (delta upper A divided by upper A much less than 1δ A/A << 1), and the

There are various approaches to this problem. We summarize two of these—the 
simple argument of Rovelli’s [ 7] and the number theoretical approach of [ 8, 9] in the  
next section, and in the following section which we describe the approach based on 
Chern-Simons theory with SU(2) gauge group. 
8.1.1
Rovelli’s Counting 
We want to compute the number of sequences upper N left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisN (M), where each sequence StartSet k Subscript i Baseline EndSet{ki} 
satisﬁes

Let upper N Subscript plus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisN+(M) denote the number of sequences such that sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts k Subscript i Baseline equals upper M∑
i ki = M and upper N Subscript minus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisN−(M) 
denote the number of sequences such that sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts left parenthesis k Subscript i Baseline plus 1 right parenthesis equals upper M∑
i (ki + 1) = M). Then the above set of 
inequalities implies that [ 7] 
upper N Subscript minus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis less than upper N left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis less than upper N Subscript plus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis periodN−(M) <  N (M) <  N+(M) .
(8.13) 
Computing upper N Subscript plus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisN+(M) boils down to counting the number of partitions of upper MM, i.e. 
the numbers of sets of ordered, positive integers whose sum is upper MM. As noted in 
[ 7], this can be solved by observing that if left parenthesis k 1 comma k 2 comma ellipsis comma k Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis(k1, k2, . . . ,  kn) is a partition of upper MM, 
then 
left parenthesis k 1 comma k 2 comma ellipsis comma k Subscript n Baseline comma 1 right parenthesis(k1, k2, . . . ,  kn, 1) and 
left parenthesis k 1 comma k 2 comma ellipsis comma k Subscript n Baseline plus 1 right parenthesis(k1, k2, . . . ,  kn + 1)
are 
partitions 
of 
upper M plus 1M + 1. 
All partitions of upper M plus 1M + 1 can be obtained in this manner and therefore we have 
upper N Subscript plus Baseline left parenthesis upper M plus 1 right parenthesis equals 2 upper N Subscript plus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesisN+(M + 1) = 2N+(M), which implies thatupper N Subscript plus Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals upper C 2 Superscript upper MN+(M) = C2M, whereupper CC is a constant.

Number Theoretical Approach 
This approach consists of two steps: 
A.
Determine allowed sequences. This involves solving the Brahmagupta-Pell 
(BP) equation. 4 For now, we will work in units where 4 pi gamma l Subscript normal upper P Superscript 2 Baseline identical to 14πγl2 
P ≡ 1. Thus for 
a given set of upper NN punctures on a quantum horizon, the total area can be written 
as 
upper A equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript upper N Endscripts upper A Subscript i Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript upper N Endscripts StartRoot left parenthesis k Subscript i Baseline plus 1 right parenthesis squared minus 1 EndRoot periodA = 
N

Ai =

∑
i=1
√
(ki + 1)2 − 1 . 
For each possible value of kk, let g Subscript kgk be the number of punctures which have the 
corresponding eigenvalue. So, we can write 
upper A equals sigma summation Underscript k equals 1 Overscript k Subscript max Baseline Endscripts g Subscript k Baseline StartRoot left parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis squared minus 1 EndRootA = 
kmax
∑
k=1 
gk
√
(k + 1)2 − 1 
with g Subscript k Baseline equals 0gk = 0 if no puncture has spin k divided by 2k/2. Clearly the sum over all possible 
values of kk gives the total number of punctures on the horizon, sigma summation Underscript k Endscripts g Subscript k Baseline equals upper N∑
k gk = N. 
As shown in Appendix N, the square root of any integer can be written as 
the product of an integer and the square-root of a square-free integer. Since 
k element of double struck upper Z right double arrow left parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis squared minus 1 element of double struck upper Zk ∈ Z ⇒ (k + 1)2 − 1 ∈ Z, therefore we can write 
StartRoot left parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis squared minus 1 EndRoot equals y Subscript k Baseline StartRoot p Subscript k Baseline EndRoot
√
(k + 1)2 − 1 = yk 
√pk 
for some y Subscript k Baseline element of double struck upper Zyk ∈ Z and p Subscript k Baseline element of double struck upper Apk ∈ A, where double struck upper AA is the set of square-free integers. This 
implies that the area eigenvalue can be written as an integer linear combination 
of square-roots of square-free numbers, 
upper A equals sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript i Subscript max Baseline Endscripts y Subscript i Baseline StartRoot p Subscript i Baseline EndRoot commaA =

4 It is well-known that the name of “Pell’s Equation” was the result of Leonhard Euler’s misidenti-
ﬁcation of John Pell with the mathematician Lord Brouckner. If we gave Euler a second chance to 
name the equation, he might have called it “Brouckner’s equation”. This equation had previously 
been intensively studied by the Indian mathematicians Brahmagupta and Bhaskara around the 5th 
century B.C. and 12th century A.D. respectively. However, Brouckner and Euler are to be forgiven 
for not having knowledge of the existence of this earlier work. The authors hereby take the liberty 
of correcting this historical wrong associated with the naming of this equation, by adding the preﬁx 
“Brahmagupta” to the presently accepted name “Pell’s Equation”.

i = 1. 
This is commonly known as Pell’s equation, or perhaps more appropriately as the 
Brahmagupta-Pell equation. A method for obtaining its solutions is described 
in Appendix O. 
B.
Determine the number of valid ways of sprinkling labels from an allowed 
sequence onto the edges. This can be mapped to one of the simpler exam-
ples of NP-complete problems in the ﬁeld of computational complexity—the 
number partitioning problem (NPP) [ 10,11]. 
The relevance of the NPP for black hole entropy arises as follows: The counting 
of states of a horizon for a non-rotating black hole boils down to determin-
ing the number of ways in which we can choose spin-labels k Subscript iki from a given 
sequence StartSet k 1 comma period period period comma k Subscript upper N Baseline EndSet{k1, ..., kN} (where the allowed sequences are determined by solving 
the Brahmagupta-Pell equation) to each of the i equals 1 period period period upper Ni = 1...N edges puncturing the 
horizon, such that sigma summation k Subscript i Baseline equals 0∑ki = 0. 
More generally the case where sigma summation k Subscript i Baseline equals m left parenthesis m greater than 0 right parenthesis∑ki = m (m > 0), corresponds to a horizon 
with angular momentummm. This is equivalent to the statement of the NPP, where 
given an arbitrary but ﬁxed sequence of (positive) integersupper A equals StartSet a Subscript i Baseline comma period period period comma a Subscript upper N Baseline EndSetA = {ai , ..., aN}, one 
asks for the number of ways upper N Subscript upper ANA in which we can partition upper AA into two subsets 
upper A Subscript plusA+ and upper A Subscript minusA−, such that the difference of the sum of the elements of each subset 
is minimized, sigma summation Underscript upper A Subscript plus Baseline Endscripts a Subscript i Baseline minus sigma summation Underscript upper A Subscript minus Baseline Endscripts a Subscript i Baseline equals m∑

A− ai = m. For the black hole entropy problem mm 
is given by sigma summation k Subscript i Superscript plus Baseline minus sigma summation k Subscript i Superscript minus Baseline equals m∑k+ 
i −∑k− 
i = m. 
As shown in [ 8] this problem can be mapped to a non-interacting spin-system 
[ 12] as follows. Consider a chain ofupper NN spins each of which can be in an upvertical bar up arrow right angle bracket|↑⟩
state or a down vertical bar down arrow right angle bracket|↓⟩state. If a Subscript iai belongs to upper A Subscript plusA+ (upper A Subscript minusA−) then we set the iith spin to 
up (down). Consequently the constraintupper A Subscript plus Baseline minus upper A Subscript minus Baseline equals mA+ − A− = m can be expressed as the 
condition that 
m minus sigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript upper N Endscripts a Subscript i Baseline upper S Subscript i Baseline equals 0m −

where upper S Subscript i Baseline element of StartSet plus 1 comma negative 1 EndSetSi ∈{+1, −1} are the possible eigenvalues of sigma Subscript zσz. The problem of parti-

8.1.3
Chern-Simons Approach 
Another approach to the black hole entropy problem rests on the observation that 
the dynamics of punctures on the black hole horizon, in the framework of LQG, 
is described by a Chern-Simons theory. This relationship was ﬁrst observed in the 
classic papers by Ashtekar et al. [ 13– 15]. 
Building upon these ﬁndings, Kaul and Majumdar [ 16] were the ﬁrst to show 
that the Bekenstein-Hawking expression for the entropy of a four-dimensional 
Schwarzschild black hole could be obtained from the dimensionality of the Hilbert 
space of an SU(2) Chern-Simons theory living on the horizon of that black hole. In 
addition to the leading term proportional to the area of the horizon, they were also 
able to obtain corrections proportional to the logarithm of the area in [ 17]. For a 
recent updated review of their ﬁndings see [ 18,19]. 
More recently work by Engle and co-workers [ 20,21], reaches a similar conclusion 
by working in a manifestly SU(2) invariant formulation of the horizon degrees of 
freedom. 
For a possible connection between the physics of the quantum Hall effect, as 
described by a Chern-Simons theory, and the question of black hole entropy see 
[ 22,23]. 
In this regard it is also worth mentioning that Chern-Simons theory provides 
an exact solution of the Hamiltonian constraint in terms of Ashtekar’s self-dual 
variables. This solution is known as the Kodama state [ 24] and its properties have 
been extensively studied by Randono [ 25– 27]. A brief introduction to the Kodama 
state is given in Appendix G. 
8.1.4
Entropy from Entanglement 
The relationship between entropy of entanglement and the entropy of black hole 
horizons was ﬁrst suggested more than two decades ago in [ 28,29]. 
Consider a system, which could be a one-dimensional spin-chain (Fig. 8.2a) or a 
quantum ﬁeld theory living on some spacetime (Fig. 8.2b). Divide the system into 
two partsupper AA andupper BB. Letrho Subscript upper A upper BρAB be the density matrix representing the state of the system

The von-Neumann entropyupper S Subscript upper ASA of regionupper AA (or the entropyupper S Subscript upper BSB of region upper BB) can now 
be deﬁned as 
upper S Subscript upper A Baseline equals trace Subscript upper A Baseline left bracket rho Subscript upper A Baseline ln rho Subscript upper A Baseline right bracket comma upper S Subscript upper B Baseline equals trace Subscript upper B Baseline left bracket rho Subscript upper B Baseline ln rho Subscript upper B Baseline right bracket periodSA = TrA [ρA ln ρA] ,
SB = TrB [ρB ln ρB] .
(8.17) 
The two entropies are equal, upper S Subscript upper A Baseline equals upper S Subscript upper BSA = SB, so we only need to calculate one of them. In 
[ 28,29] a scalar ﬁeld was employed as a “probe” ﬁeld. After performing the trace 
over the interior region (upper BB in Fig. 8.2b), the reduced density matrix rho Subscript upper AρA was found. 
Its von-Neumann entropy was found to be proportional to the area of the boundary 
surfaceupper SS separating the interior and exterior regions. 5 This relationship between the 
entanglement entropy and the “area” of the boundary has turned out to be very general 
and is not limited to3 plus 13 + 1 dimensional spacetime or to scalar ﬁelds. Some reviews of 
this phenomenon of “holographic” entanglement entropy are [ 30,31]. A perspective 
inspired by the anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdSCFT) correspondence 
can be found in [ 32]. 
In 2010, a seminal paper by Mark Van Raamsdonk [ 33] argued that entanglement 
is the glue that holds spacetime together. A similar idea had earlier been suggested by 
Brian Swingle [ 34] who proposed that holographic spacetimes ﬁnd a realization in the 
structure of networks formed from a technique, originally developed for studying 
many body strongly correlated systems, known as entanglement renormalization 
[ 35,36]. Since then a substantial amount of work has been done [ 37,38] towards 
providing concrete support for this proposal. 
5 Strictly speaking, a surface and its area are not the same thing, and the entropy is proportional 
to the area rather than equal to it. However we feel it is acceptable in this case to use the standard 
symbol for entropy, upper SS, to indicate the boundary surface between the two regions, because of the 
conceptual connection between the surface and the entropy.

In 2006 Livine and Terno [ 39] ﬁrst suggested that entanglement between differ-
ent parts of the horizon might contribute to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the 
black hole. In 2008 Donelly [ 40] and in 2012 Bianchi and Myers [ 41,42] proposed 
that Bekenstein-Hawking entropy could be understood as arising from the entropy of 
entanglement between the quantum geometric degrees of freedom on either side of 
the horizon. Similar ideas have been put forth by Dasgupta [ 43]. While these propos-
als have much in common with Raamsdonk & Swingle’s ideas of geometry emerging 
from entanglement, the question of black hole entropy has yet to be addressed in the 
context of entanglement renormalization. 
In conclusion, the study of black hole entropy in LQG is a very rich and active 
ﬁeld and the results presented in this review, while very important and pioneering, 
should not been seen as the ﬁnal word on this topic. 
8.2
Loop Quantum Cosmology 
One of the ﬁrst avenues to follow when approaching old problems with new tools 
is to select the simplest possible scenarios for study, in the hope that the under-
standing gained in this arena would ultimately lead to a better understanding of 
more complex systems and processes. In classical GR this corresponds to studying 
the symmetry reduced solutions 6 of Einstein’s equations, such as the Friedmann-
LeMaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies and their anisotropic counter-
parts, and various other exact solutions such as deSitter, anti-deSitter, Schwarzschild, 
Kerr-Newman etc. 7 which correspond respectively to a “universe” (in this very 
restricted sense) with positive cosmological constant (normal upper Lamda greater than 0Ʌ >  0), a universe withnormal upper Lamda less than 0Ʌ <  0, 
a non-rotating black hole and a rotating black hole (both in asymptotically ﬂat space-
times 8 ). In each of these cases the metric has a very small number of local degrees 
of freedom and hence provides only a “toy model”. Of course, in the real world, 
the cosmos is a many-body system and reducing its study to a model such as the 
FLRW universe is a gross simpliﬁcation. However, via such models, one can obtain 
a qualitative grasp of the behavior of the cosmos on the largest scales. This is the 
spirit in which the ideas of LQG are applied to the cosmos as a whole, leading to the 
ﬁeld of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). 
The following discussion draws primarily from [ 46– 48]. For a more in-depth 
introduction to the topic the reader is invited to consult [ 49,50]. 
6 That is, the solutions of the EFEs possessing strong global symmetries which reduces the effective 
local degrees of freedom to a small number. 
7 We refer the reader to the extremely comprehensive and well-researched catalog of solutions to 
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, in both metric and connection variables, presented in [ 44]. A somewhat 
older, but still valuable, catalog of exact solutions is given in [ 45].

are as follows:

foldscript upper MM and a metric deﬁned on that manifold,g Subscript mu nugμν, is said to be spatially homogeneous

that for any two points x comma y element of normal upper Sigma Subscript t Baselinex, y ∈∑t , there exists an s element of upper Ss ∈ S such that s left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals ys(x) = y. Under

where s Superscript stars⋆is the pullback 9 of the spatial metric under the action of the isometry ss.

an arbitrary rotation acting on elements of upper T Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisTp(x). 
Isotropy is a more restrictive condition than homogeneity, because isotropy nec-
essarily implies homogeneity, however the reverse is not true.

Connection Variables 
In the connection formulation the deﬁnition of isotropy and homogeneity is different 
from that in the metric picture, because here the relevant variables—the connection 
and tetrad—transform not under the action of diffeomorphisms, but under the action 
of gauge transformations gg. 11 
Gauge Transformation Given a gauge group upper GG (typically SL left parenthesis 2 comma double struck upper C right parenthesisSL(2, C) for four-
dimensional Lorentzian gravity or SU(2) for the three-dimensional spatial slices) 
and a manifoldscript upper MM, a gauge transformation is a mapg colon script upper M right arrow upper Gg : M → G from the manifold 
to the group, whose action on a given connection-tetrad (or triad) pair left parenthesis upper A Subscript a Superscript i Baseline comma e Subscript i Superscript a Baseline right parenthesis( Ai

While states of the form e Superscript bold i mu Super Subscript j Superscript ceiμ j c look very much like the familiar plane-waves e Superscript bold i k xeikx of 
classical and (non-loop) quantum mechanics, in contrast to plane-waves holonomy 
states are discontinuous in the “momenta”mu Subscript jμ j . This can be understood by recognising 
that for general graph states, i.e. those not restricted to correspond to homogeneous 
and/or isotropic geometries, states living on different graphs are orthogonal (6.12),

In the present situation, when two statespsi 1ψ1 andpsi 2ψ2 are given in terms of two different 
sets of “momenta” StartSet mu Subscript j Baseline EndSet{μ j} and StartSet mu Subscript j prime Baseline EndSet{μ j'}, the two states can be said to living on different

regardless of how small the difference mu Subscript i Baseline minus mu Subscript jμi − μ j is. Thus the basis states (8.39) for a 
homogeneous, isotropic spacetime are deﬁned on a real number line, equipped not 
with the usual continuous topology, but with a discrete topology! Because of this 
fact there does not exist any operator corresponding to the connectionModifyingAbove c With caretˆc. 13 Therefore 
13 One might hope that such an operator could be obtained by taking the derivative ofModifyingAbove exp bold i mu c With caret

when quantizing expressions involving powers ofcc, the corresponding operators have 
to be constructed from exponentials of the connection. 
As an example, consider the factor ofc squaredc2, occurring in the deﬁnition of the Hamil-

to write ModifyingAbove c With caret squaredˆc2 in terms of exponentials. This can be done by noting that

upper SS, and n Superscript a Baseline comma n Superscript b Baseline comma n Superscript cna, nb, nc are tangent vectors to the edges of normal upper Gamma┌which meet at vv. 
Now, we know that the operator ModifyingAbove bold italic upper J With caret ˆJ is bounded from below, i.e. has a minimum 
eigenvalue of 1 divided by 21/2. Thus the volume operator ModifyingAbove upper V With caret V must also necessarily be bounded 
from below, with the smallest possible volume eigenvalue in LQG being of the order 
gamma Superscript 3 divided by 2 Baseline l Subscript normal upper P Superscript 3γ3/2l3 
P. 
Thus we arrive at the conclusion that because of the quantization of geometric 
operators in full LQG it is not permissible to take the limitdelta right arrow 0δ → 0 in expressions such 
as (8.54). This fact lies at the core of the observation that LQC cures the singularities 
in cosmological evolution that are encountered in the limit that the scale factor 
bold italic a right arrow 0a → 0 when we solve the classical FRLW equations or their quantum counterparts, 
the Wheeler-deWitt equations. 
Furthermore, a similar line of reasoning shows that the factor ofModifyingAbove StartAbsoluteValue p EndAbsoluteValue Superscript negative 3 divided by 2 Baseline With caret  
|p|−3/2, multiply-
ing the scalar ﬁeld momentum in the LQC Hamiltonian (8.52), remains bounded from 
above throughout the evolution of the universe. In classical general relativity, where 
p tilde bold italic a squaredp ∼ a2, as the initial Big Bang singularity is approached, the scale factor diverges 
bold italic a right arrow 0a → 0, leading to inﬁnite energy densities for the scalar (and any other matter) ﬁeld. 
In LQC, the fact that ModifyingAbove StartAbsoluteValue p EndAbsoluteValue Superscript negative 3 divided by 2 Baseline With caret  
|p|−3/2 has an upper bound of order tilde l Subscript normal upper P Superscript negative 3∼ l−3 
P , ensures that such 
divergences do not occur. The consequence is that cosmological evolution remains 
regular and non-singular as one approaches the Big Bang and, in fact, one can evolve 
past the moment of creation into what can be interpreted as a collapsing phase of a 
universe which existed before our own! 
Though the interpretation of the various branches of the cosmological evolution 
in LQC as bouncing universes might be a matter of some debate, it is clear that due 
to the tight consistency constraints on this geometric approach to quantum gravity 
we can rest assured that singularities such as the one encountered at the moment of 
the Big Bang or the one which is the end result of uncontrolled gravitational collapse 
of matter, resulting in formation of a black hole, are artifacts of a description of

Discussion 
Any fair and balanced review of LQG should also mention at least a few of the many 
objections its critics have presented. A list of a few of the more important points of 
weakness in the framework and brief responses to them follows: 
1. LQG admits a volume extensive entropy and therefore does not respect the Holo-
graphic principle: This criticism hinges upon the description of states of quantum 
gravity as spin networks which are essentially spin-systems on arbitrary graphs. 
However, spin networks only constitute the kinematical Hilbert space of LQG. 
They are solutions of the spatial diffeomorphism and the Gauss constraints but not 
of the Hamiltonian constraint which generates time-evolution. This criticism is 
therefore due to a (perhaps understandable) failure to grasp the difference between 
the kinematical and the dynamical phase space of LQG. 
In order to solve the Hamiltonian constraint we are forced to enlarge the set of 
states to include spin foams which are histories of spin networks. In a nutshell 
then, as we mentioned in Sect. 6.6, the kinematical states of LQG are the spin 
networks, while the dynamical states are the spin foams. The amplitudes asso-
ciated with a given spin foam are determined completely by the speciﬁcation of 
its boundary state. Physical observables do not depend on the possible internal 
conﬁgurations of a spin foam but only on its boundary state. In this sense LQG 
satisﬁes a stronger and cleaner version of holography than string theory, where 
this picture emerges from considerations involving graviton scattering from cer-
tain extremal black hole solutions. 
In [ 1] it is shown that in the context of loop quantum cosmology of a radiation-
ﬁlled ﬂat FLRW model, Bousso’s covariant entropy bound [ 2] is respected. As 
one approaches the moment of the Big Bang, and quantum gravitational effects 
become large the bound is violated, however, far from the Big Bang, when geom-
etry has become semiclassical the bound comes into force. 
As yet, there is no general proof of whether or not LQG respects Bousso’s bound. 
However, one might argue that the structure of LQG is amenable to the spirit of

Discussion 
Bousso’s bound. The latter suggests that there is a fundamental limit to the num-
ber of degrees of freedom in any given region of spacetime. Such a fundamental 
limit is already present in LQG in the form of the quantized area and volume 
operators which tell us that any region of spacetime must contain a ﬁnite number 
of geometric degrees of freedom. 
2. LQG violates the principle of local Lorentz invariance/picks out a preferred frame 
of reference: Lorentz invariance is obeyed in LQG but obviously not in the exact 
manner as for a continuum geometry. As has been shown by Rovelli and Speziale 
[ 3] the kinematical phase space of LQG can be cast into a manifestly Lorentz 
covariant form. A spin network/spin foam state transforms in a well-deﬁned way 
under boosts and rotations. Similarly in quantum mechanics one ﬁnds that a 
quantum rotor transforms under discrete representations of the rotation group 
SOleft parenthesis 3 right parenthesis(3). 
3. LQG does not have stable semiclassical geometries as solutions—geometry 
“crumbles”: CDT simulations e.g. [ 4] show how a stable geometry emerges. 
As mentioned in Sect. 4.1, this involves calculating a sum over histories for the 
geometry of spacetime, between some initial and ﬁnal state. The stability of the 
spacetimes studied in such simulations appears to be dependent on causality— 
that is, spacetime geometries develop unphysical structures in the Euclidean case, 
which are controlled when there is a well-deﬁned past and future, as is the case 
in LQG. The question of exactly how similar CDT and LQG are to each other is 
a matter of continuing investigation. 
4. LQG does not contain fermionic and bosonic excitations that could be identiﬁed 
with members of the Standard Model: The area and volume operators do not 
describe the entirety of the structures that can occur within spin networks. LQG 
or a suitably modiﬁed version which allows braiding between various edges will 
exhibit invariant topological structures. Recent work [ 5– 10] has been able to 
identify some such structures with SM particles. In addition, in any spin-system— 
such as LQG—there are effective (emergent) low-energy degrees of freedom 
which satisfy the equations of motion for Dirac and gauge ﬁelds. Xiao-Gang 
Wen and Michael Levin [ 11,12] have investigated so-called “string-nets” and 
ﬁnd that the appropriate physical framework is the so-called “tensor category” 
or “tensor network” theory [ 13– 15]. In fact string-nets are very similar to spin 
networks so Wen and Levin’s work—showing that gauge bosons and fermions 
are quasiparticles of string-net condensates—should carry over into LQG without 
much modiﬁcation. 
5. LQG does not exhibit dualities in the manner String Theory does: Any spin system 
exhibits dualities. A graph based model like LQG even more so. One example of 
a duality is to consider the dual of a spin network which is a so-called 2-skeleton 
or simplicial cell-complex. Another is the star-triangle transformation, which can 
be applied to spin networks which have certain symmetries, and which leads to a 
duality between the low and high temperature versions of a theory on a hexagonal 
and triangular lattice respectively [ 16]. 
6. LQG doesn’t admit supersymmetry, wants to avoid extra dimensions, strings, 
extended objects, etc: Extra dimensions and supersymmetry are precisely that—

“extra”. Occam’s razor dictates that a successful physical theory should be 
founded on the minimum number of ingredients. It is worth noting that at the time 
of writing of this book, results from the Large Hadron Collider appear to have 
ruled out many supersymmetric extensions of the standard model. By avoiding 
the inclusion of extra dimensions and supersymmetry, LQG represents a perfectly 
valid attempt to create a theory that is consistent with observations. 
7. LQG has a proliferation of models and lacks robustness: Again a lack of extra 
baggage implies the opposite. LQG is a tightly constrained framework. There 
are various uniqueness theorems which underlie its foundations and were rig-
orously proven in the 1990s by Ashtekar, Lewandowski and others. There are 
questions about the role of the Immirzi parameter and the ambiguity it introduces 
however these are part and parcel of the broader question of the emergence of 
semi-classicality from LQG (see Simone Mercuri’s papers [ 17,18] in this regard). 
8. LQG does not contain any well-deﬁned observables and does not allow us to 
calculate graviton scattering amplitudes: Several calculations of two-point cor-
relation functions in spin foams exist in the literature [ 19]. These demonstrate the 
emergence of an inverse-square law. 
As well as discussing criticisms of LQG, it is also fair to consider what role this 
theory may have in the future. We would not have written a review of the formulation 
of LQG if we did not consider it an important and interesting theory—one which 
we feel is probably a good representation of the nature of spacetime. However it is 
wise to remember that most physical theories are ultimately found to be ﬂawed or 
inadequate representations of reality, and it would be unrealistic to think that the 
same might not be true of LQG. Questions linger about the nature of time and the 
interpretation of the Hamiltonian constraint, among other things. What is the value 
then, in studying LQG? Perhaps LQG will eventually be shown to be untenable, or 
perhaps it will be entirely vindicated. As authors of this book, we feel that the truth 
will probably lie somewhere in the middle, and that however much of our current 
theories of LQG survive over the next few decades, this research program does 
provide strong indications about what some future (and, we hope, experimentally 
validated) theory of “quantum gravity” will look like.

A.1
Lie Groups and Algebras
Symmetries in physics (that is to say, transformations which leave the underlying
physics unchanged) and conserved quantities are intimately related by Noether’s
theorem. Symmetries play a pivotal role in establishing which physical laws are
allowed. For instance we saw in Sect.3.1 how the requirement that the laws of physics
remain unchanged under a local gauge transformation necessitated the existence of
a covariant derivative and a gauge ﬁeld.
Symmetries have several properties which are taken as the deﬁning features of a
group. Consider a set upper GG containing elements g 1 comma g 2 comma ellipsisg1, g2, . . . Furthermore, consider an
operation, denoted here by the symbol degrees◦, which maps exactly two elements of upper GG
to some quantity. We will call such a mapping a binary operation. Then the set and
binary operation taken together form a group if for allg element of upper Gg ∈G the following properties
are satisﬁed:
1. g Subscript j Baseline degrees g Subscript k Baseline element of upper G comma for all g Subscript j Baseline comma g Subscript k Baseline element of upper Gg j ◦gk ∈G, ∀g j, gk ∈G (closure)
2. there exists e element of upper G∃e ∈G such that g degrees e equals e degrees g equals gg ◦e = e ◦g = g (identity)
3. for all g element of upper G there exists g Superscript negative 1 element of upper G∀g ∈G ∃g−1 ∈G such that g Superscript negative 1 Baseline degrees g equals g degrees g Superscript negative 1 Baseline equals eg−1 ◦g = g ◦g−1 = e (inverse)
4. g Subscript j Baseline normal degree left parenthesis g Subscript k Baseline degrees g Subscript l Baseline right parenthesis equals left parenthesis g Subscript j Baseline degrees g Subscript k Baseline right parenthesis degrees g Subscript l Baseline for all g Subscript j Baseline comma g Subscript k Baseline comma g Subscript l Baseline element of upper Gg j ◦(gk ◦gl) = (g j ◦gk) ◦gl ∀g j, gk, gl ∈G (associativity)
The groups we will be concerned with have elements that vary continuously as
functions of some parameter or parameters. These are known as Lie groups. For
example, rotations through some angle thetaθ, which can be written as g left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i thetag(θ) = eiθ, and
which transform one point on a unit circle to another. In what follows we will call
this the circle group. It is worth emphasising that the group elements in this case are
the transformations of the points on a circle, and not the points themselves.
Rotations in a circle can also be enacted by operating on a vector by a2 times 22 × 2 matrix.
Such matrices have two important properties. Their transpose is also their inverse
(we refer to such matrices as “orthogonal”) and their determinant is equal to +1 (we

Appendix A:Groups,Representations,and Algebras
refer to such matrices as “special”). Hence these matrices are called SO(2) matrices
(short for “special orthogonal two-by-two”). Such matrices are again continuous
functions of the single parameterthetaθ, and are hence isomorphic to the circle group. The
circle group is actually a 1 times 11 × 1 example of a “unitary” group (one whose transpose
complex conjugate is its inverse). Hence the circle group is also called U(1). Note
that the special unitary group of 1 times 11 × 1 matrices SU(1) consists of only a single
element, the identity, and is referred to as the trivial group. While the special groups
correspond to rotations, the groups of matrices with determinantequals negative 1= −1 correspond to
reﬂections. Generalupper N times upper NN × N matrices with arbitrary non-zero determinants (i.e. they
are invertible) form the “general linear” group GL(upper NN). Where required, the ﬁeld of
numbers used as matrix elements can be speciﬁed explicitly. For instance the group
whose elements areupper N times upper NN × N matrices with complex entries and arbitrary determinants
is GL(upper NN,double struck upper CC). The subgroup with determinant equals plus 1= +1 of this general linear group is
SL(upper NN,double struck upper CC). The unitary subgroup of this special linear group is SU(upper NN), or SU(upper NN,double struck upper CC)
if one is being explicit. Restricting to the ﬁeld of real numbers we obtain the special
orthogonal group SO(upper NN). The orthogonal groups represent rotations in a space with
a Riemannian metric (i.e. one which always ascribes a separation greater than zero
to distinct points). In Minkowski space, with metriceta Subscript mu nu Baseline equals diag left parenthesis negative 1 comma plus 1 comma plus 1 comma plus 1 right parenthesisημν = diag(−1, +1, +1, +1),
the group of Lorentz transformations is SO(3,1), denoting that in nn dimensions (in
this case n equals 4n = 4), only n minus 1n −1 of the terms in the metric are positive.
Since SO(2) and U(1) both embody rotations in a circle, it is clear that there
can be different representations of a group. In fact, we could represent rotations in
the complex plane by an inﬁnite number of different functions, exp left brace bold i k theta right braceexp{ikθ}, with each
function being labelled by different integer1 values of the parameterkk. Speciﬁcally,
a representation of a group is a mapping from group elements gg to functions upper D left parenthesis g right parenthesisD(g),
which are usually taken to be matrices, such that upper D left parenthesis g Subscript a Baseline right parenthesis upper D left parenthesis g Subscript b Baseline right parenthesis equals upper D left parenthesis g Subscript a Baseline degrees g Subscript b Baseline right parenthesisD(ga)D(gb) = D(ga ◦gb) for all
a comma ba, b. We can easily see that, for instance, rotations in the plane can be represented
by the 1 times 11 × 1 “matrices” upper D 1 left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i thetaD1(θ) = eiθ, and the 2 times 22 × 2 matrices

Some representations contain a level of redundancy, allowing them to be viewed as
composed of simpler representations. Such redundant representations are referred to
as being reducible. A representation which is not reducible is called an irreducible
representation or irrep.
The tangent space to a Lie group (e.g. the group of rotations g left parenthesis theta right parenthesis equals e Superscript bold i thetag(θ) = eiθ) at
the identity, is the corresponding Lie algebra. Rotations in three dimensions can
be represented by the group SO(3), or the group SU(2). To be speciﬁc, consider
a general element upper R element of SU left parenthesis 2 right parenthesisR ∈SU(2) which can be written in terms of three parameters

Lie algebras are referred to with the same notation, but lower case fraktur lettering,
as the corresponding group. Hence the Lie algebra of SU(2) isGerman s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesissu(2). Since this group
corresponds to rotations in three dimensions, German s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesissu(2) has three generators, which we
recognise from Eqs. (A.3) above as the Pauli matrices, sigma Subscript aσa.
At an intuitive level, an algebra can be thought of as a vector space with the
usual operation of vector addition, and a second binary operation (generally called
the commutator or Lie bracket). In the case of the circle group, the Lie algebra is
one-dimensional, and the (single) basis vector deﬁnes a direction of rotation. The
entire group can be built up by inﬁnitesimal iterations of this rotation, and hence the
group is said to be generated by the basis vector of the corresponding Lie algebra.
General elements of SU(2) are created (in analogy to the U(1) exampleexp left parenthesis i theta right parenthesisexp(iθ)), by
exponentiating theGerman s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesissu(2) generators multiplied by three angle parameters. Hence we
have exp left brace bold i theta Subscript a Baseline t Subscript a Baseline right braceexp{iθata}, where t Subscript a Baseline equals one half sigma Subscript ata = 1
2σa. The commutator of the German s u left parenthesis 2 right parenthesissu(2) generators is given
by the relation left bracket t Subscript a Baseline comma t Subscript b Baseline right bracket equals bold i epsilon Subscript a b c Baseline t Subscript c[ta, tb] = iϵabctc.
The groups SO(3) and SU(2) share equivalent Lie algebras, but this does not mean
the two groups are identical, as a Lie algebra is a tangent space deﬁned at the identity
element. SU(2) and SO(3) are locally isomorphic, but globally distinct, as there are
two elements in SU(2) that correspond to each element in SO(3). We say that SU(2)
is a double cover of SO(3), and also refer to SU(2) as the universal covering group
of SO(3).
For the purposes of explaining loop quantum gravity we will be most often con-
cerned with SU(2), though what we are about to say can be easily generalised to
other groups. The SU(2) matrices act on vectors with two complex components.
Such vectors can be written as linear combinations of the two basis vectors

In the case of intrinsic angular momentum these correspond to pure “spin-up” and
“spin-down” states. Multiplying these by italic h over two pi t 3 equals one half italic h over two pi sigma 3 t3 = 1

The set of eigenvalues StartSet plus italic h over two pi divided by 2 comma negative italic h over two pi divided by 2 EndSet{+ /2, − /2} is an example of a multiplet of states. As
the discussion above suggests, different representations of SU(2) are possible, and
these act upon different multiplets. Note that if we setitalic h over two pi equals 1 = 1 the number of states in
the multiplet is equal to 2 bold italic j plus 12 j + 1, where bold italic j j is the largest eigenvalue in the multiplet.

Appendix A:Groups,Representations,and Algebras
Different representations can therefore be referred to by the largest eigenvalue in
the corresponding multiplet. It is a common and unfortunate practice, however, to
refer to the eigenvalues as a representation of the group. This can be confusing,
as the eigenvalues do not have the deﬁning property of a representation, namely
that upper D left parenthesis g Subscript a Baseline right parenthesis upper D left parenthesis g Subscript b Baseline right parenthesis equals upper D left parenthesis g Subscript a Baseline degrees g Subscript b Baseline right parenthesisD(ga)D(gb) = D(ga ◦gb) for all a comma ba, b. Therefore when the student encounters
statements that the loops from which loop quantum gravity derives its name are
“labelled by representations of SU(2)”, it should be understood that what is really
meant is that representations of SU(2) are associated to the loops and in turn the
loops “are labelled by values drawn from the multiplets upon which representations
of SU(2) act”, a point we have also attempted to emphasise in Sect. 6.1.
A.2
Lorentz Lie-Algebra
In Sect.4.3.3 we discussed the Lorentz group, which consists of rotations around
three axes, generated by upper J Subscript xJx, upper J Subscript yJy, upper J Subscript zJz, and boosts along three axes, generated by upper K Subscript xKx,
upper K Subscript yKy, upper K Subscript zKz. It was noted that a 2 times 22 × 2 representation of the rotations and boosts can be
constructed from the Pauli matrices, as per Eq. (4.44). It is useful to recognise that
the upper J Subscript aJa can be regarded as purely spatial rotations, while the upper K Subscript aKa can be thought of
as rotations in the three planes deﬁned by the time axis and each of the three spatial
axes.
The generators of the nn-dimensional representation of the Lorentz Lie algebra
can be written in terms of the (n times nn × n) Dirac gamma matricesStartSet gamma Superscript upper I Baseline EndSet{γI}, which satisfy the
anticommutation relations

where g Superscript upper I upper JgI J is the metric tensor and double struck 1 Subscript n times n1n×n is the n times nn × n identity matrix.
For the case of n equals 4n = 4, a possible choice of the matrices is given by

Blades,Forms,and Duality
The notion of self-/anti-self-duality of the gauge ﬁeldupper F Subscript alpha betaFαβ is central to understanding
both the topological sector of Yang-Mills theory and the solutions of Einstein’s equa-
tions in the connection formulation. As discussed in Sect.3.2, the use of multivectors
and kk-forms can be very helpful for understanding duality. They also occur in the
formulation of BF theory and hence play a role in setting the stage for spinfoams,
as well as various approaches to writing GR as a gauge theory. Let us review these
concepts.
B.1
Blades and Multivectors
A vector is normally visualised as a directed line segment with a magnitude which
is interpreted as a length. One way to form the product of two vectors ModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v
is the dot productModifyingAbove u With right arrow dot ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u · →v, which is a scalar that is maximised when the vectors are par-
allel. We can also form the wedge product,ModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v, which is a directed surface spanned
byModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u andModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v (the direction being both an orientation in space and a preferred direction
of rotation around the boundary of the surface), with a magnitude interpreted as the
area of the surface. This directed surface is called a bivector, and its magnitude is
maximised when ModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v are perpendicular (and zero when they are parallel). The
wedge product of three non-coplanar vectors is a trivector, which may be visualised
as a parallelipiped with a direction (interpreted as a preferred direction assigned to
a path around the edges of the parallelipiped) and a magnitude (interpreted as its
volume). The wedge product of kk vectors (assuming they are not parallel, copla-
nar, etc.) will in general be called a kk-blade, and can be visualised as an oriented
kk-dimensional

that each of thekk vectors forming akk-blade deﬁne the length and orientation of its edges.

volume.3 A scalar may be regarded as a 00-blade. We will use u comma v comma wu, v, w (without
arrows) to denote kk-blades in general, and retain ModifyingAbove u With right arrow comma ModifyingAbove u With right arrow comma ModifyingAbove w With right arrow→u, →u, →w speciﬁcally for ordinary

Consider two vectors ModifyingAbove u With right arrow equals u Superscript 1 Baseline e 1 plus u squared e 2→u = u1e1 + u2e2 and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow equals v Superscript 1 Baseline e 1 plus v squared e 2→v = v1e1 + v2e2 with orthonormal
basis vectors e 1e1, e 2e2 (we restrict ourselves to two dimensions for simplicity but can
easily generalise). The most general product of the vectors ModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v, which we will
refer to as their Clifford product, is

i.e. we don’t assume the basis vectors commute. In the special case ModifyingAbove u With right arrow equals ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u = →v we let
ModifyingAbove u With right arrow ModifyingAbove v With right arrow equals ModifyingAbove u With right arrow dot ModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u→v = →u·→u, hence

= (u1)2(e1)2 + u1u2(e1e2 + e2e1) + (u2)2(e2)2
= (u1)2 + (u2)2 .
In other words, since u Superscript 1u1 and u squaredu2 commute (they’re scalars) the terms involving e 1 e 2e1e2
and e 2 e 1e2e1 must sum to zero, so left parenthesis e 1 right parenthesis squared equals left parenthesis e 2 right parenthesis squared equals 1(e1)2 = (e2)2 = 1 while e 1 e 2 equals minus e 2 e 1e1e2 = −e2e1. The product

Considering orthonormal basis vectors e Subscript iei, e Subscript je j etc. we ﬁnd that the Clifford prod-
uct e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript i Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline dot e Subscript ieiei = ei · ei. Conversely when i not equals ji /= j we have e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript j Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline and e Subscript jeie j = ei ∧e j since in this case
e Subscript i Baseline dot e Subscript j Baseline equals 0ei · e j = 0. We adopt the notation e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript j Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline and e Subscript j Baseline equals e Subscript i jeie j = ei ∧e j = ei j, and this product deﬁnes
a basis bivector. Likewise e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript j Baseline e Subscript k Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline and e Subscript j Baseline and e Subscript k Baseline equals e Subscript i j keie jek = ei ∧e j ∧ek = ei jk, and so forth. Since any
1-blade (i.e. vector) can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors e.g.
3 The terminology “kk-vector” is also sometimes used, but we avoid it here as it can cause confusion
with vectors inkk dimensions.

ModifyingAbove u With right arrow equals u Superscript 1 Baseline e 1 plus u squared e 2 plus ellipsis→u = u1e1 + u2e2 + . . . it is straightforward to extend these concepts to kk-blades
in general, so that any 2-blade (bivector) can be written as a linear combination
v equals v Superscript 12 Baseline e 12 plus v Superscript 23 Baseline e 23 plus ellipsisv = v12e12 + v23e23 + . . . (where the v Superscript i jvi j are scalars), and so forth for 33-blades, 44-
blades, etc. A linear combination of kk-blades, which may involve several different
values of kk (e.g. w equals w Superscript 1 Baseline e 1 plus w squared e 2 plus w cubed e 12w = w1e1 + w2e2 + w3e12 which is a sum of vector and bivector
parts) is referred to as a multivector, or sometimes a Clifford vector. We can readily
generalise Eq. (B.2) to deﬁne the Clifford product of kk-blades as
u v equals u dot v plus u and v perioduv = u · v + u ∧v .
(B.5)
The importance of kk-blades and multivector quantities in physics has already
been touched upon in Sect. 3.2 when discussing the ﬁeld-strength tensor. Their
importance can be further illustrated if we consider the case of four-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, where the scalar product is taken using the metriceta Subscript mu nuημν. Hence
e 0 e 0 equals negative 1e0e0 = −1, and e 1 e 1 equals e 2 e 2 equals e 3 e 3 equals plus 1e1e1 = e2e2 = e3e3 = +1. In this case there is an isomorphism
between the basis vectors and the Dirac gamma matrices, gamma Subscript muγμ, and the reader can
verify that the basis vectors satisfy StartSet e Subscript mu Baseline comma e Subscript nu Baseline EndSet equals 2 eta Subscript mu nu{eμ, eν} = 2ημν, the deﬁning relation of the
Dirac matrices (see Eq. A.4). Since this anticommutator is formed by taking Clifford
products of the e Subscript mueμ, the gamma matrices are said to generate a representation of a
Clifford algebra.4
With the scalar values of e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript ieiei established (for all values of ii) the product u vuv in
Eq. (B.5) can be explicitly evaluated by writinguu andvv in terms of the basis vectors
e Subscript iei. As a result, Eq. (B.5) remains valid even when uu is a kk-blade and vv is an ll-blade
withk not equals lk /= l, or when either or both ofuu andvv are multivectors (i.e. linear combinations
of 0-blades, 1-blades, 2-blades, etc.)
A bivector is said to be simple if it can be written as the wedge product of exactly
two vectors. This is always possible in two or three dimensions, e.g. the sum of the
two bivectorse 12 plus e 23 equals e 1 and e 2 minus e 3 and e 2 equals left parenthesis e 1 minus e 3 right parenthesis and e 2e12 + e23 = e1 ∧e2 −e3 ∧e2 = (e1 −e3) ∧e2, and hence this is the
wedge product of two vectors. However it is not necessarily possible in four or more
dimensions, e.g. e 12 plus e 34e12 + e34 is not a simple bivector.
B.2
Differential Forms and the Exterior Derivative
In Sect.3.2 we mentioned the close correspondence between kk-blades and differ-
ential forms. The most apparent distinction between these concepts is that while a
1-blade has a magnitude interpreted as a length, a 1-form has a magnitude which
is interpreted as a density (with 2-blades, 2-forms, 3-blades etc. having magnitudes
which generalise to area, area-density, volume etc.)
Differential forms are a tool applied to a wide variety of manifolds, but we will
take some pedagogical liberties including restricting ourselves to double struck upper R Superscript upper NRN. As a result
the discussion that ensues will hopefully be easy to follow, and build up the relevant
4 It should be emphasised that, as noted at the start of Sect. A.2, the Dirac gamma matrices provide a
representation of the algebra, but as such they are not the fundamental objects under consideration.
That honour belongs to the basis vectors themselves.

156
Appendix B:Blades,Forms,and Duality
concepts, but may cause more experienced pure mathematicians to snarl with indig-
nation. Much of the discussion that follows is distilled from Chaps.4 and 5 of [2],
and a more precise, detailed exposition can be found therein.
The standard example of a 1-form is the differential d xdx, while the equivalent
example of a vector is StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x EndFraction ∂
∂x . To understand why d xdx can be thought of as a density
(rather than a vector of inﬁnitesimal length, which is how it’s usually introduced in
elementary calculus classes) it helps to think of the directional derivative. This is the
scalar productModifyingAbove v With right arrow dot nabla f→v · ∇f of the gradient of a functionf f with some vectorModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v, and deﬁnes
how f f changes as we move along the direction deﬁned by ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v.
The important thing to keep in mind here is thatnabla f∇f is a function which embodies
all the information for how f f changes in any direction. If we specify a point upper PP (by
selecting particular values of the variables upon which f f depends) we are left with
the information deﬁning how muchf f varies under any displacement away from P. A
particular displacement is deﬁned by providing a vectorModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v. Sonabla f∇f at P is a mapping
from vectors to scalars. But the mappings from vectors to scalars are just what we
think of as forms, visualised as contour lines, with the number of contour lines a
vector crosses deﬁning a scalar product of the corresponding vector and form. Since
the point P can vary, we can think ofnabla f∇f as a ﬁeld of such mappings (or “covectors”),
one for each possible choice of P.
Now consider the total derivative of a function f f ,
d f equals StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction d x Superscript 1 Baseline plus StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x squared EndFraction d x squared plus ellipsisd f = ∂f
∂x1 dx1 + ∂f
∂x2 dx2 + . . .
(B.6)
The minimalistic change of notation fromnabla f∇f tod fd f should serve as a clue that these
are similar entities, and of course the partial derivatives occurring in Eq. (B.6) are
simply the components of nabla f∇f . It therefore makes sense to think of d x Superscript 1dx1, d x squareddx2 etc.
as the basis 1-forms that d fd f is composed of. We can then think of writing d x Superscript idxi not
to denote an inﬁnitesimal change in the quantity x Superscript ixi, but as a notation similar to ModifyingAbove e With caret Subscript iˆei
for unit basis vectors. The total derivative is a speciﬁc example of a more general
concept which we will call the exterior derivative.
Consider a kk-form, alpha equals alpha Superscript 1 Baseline and alpha squared and ellipsis alpha Superscript kα = α1 ∧α2 ∧. . . αk and an ll-form beta equals beta Superscript 1 Baseline and beta squared and ellipsis beta Superscript lβ = β1 ∧β2 ∧. . . βl,
wherekk might be equal toll, but need not be. The exterior derivative of their product
will be
d left parenthesis alpha and beta right parenthesis equals d alpha and beta plus left parenthesis negative 1 right parenthesis Superscript k Baseline alpha and d beta periodd(α ∧β) = dα ∧β + (−1)kα ∧dβ.
(B.7)
The second term acquires a factor of left parenthesis negative 1 right parenthesis Superscript k(−1)k because placing dd to the right of alphaα
involves swapping a series of wedge products, picking up a factor of negative 1−1 with each
swap. If we were to write a 11-form as alpha equals alpha Subscript i Baseline d x Superscript iα = αidxi application of Eq. (B.7) would
yield
d alpha equals d alpha Subscript i Baseline and d x Superscript i Baseline perioddα = dαi ∧dxi.
(B.8)
Prompted by Eq. (B.7) the reader may anticipate a second term on the right, however
we use this particular example to introduce the important relationd left parenthesis d f right parenthesis equals 0d(d f ) = 0 obeyed
by the exterior derivative, which ensures that the anticipated term vanishes. A similar
line of reasoning can be applied to the case of a general kk-form.

Appendix B:Blades,Forms,and Duality
157
B.3
Duality
Differential forms and kk-blades can be seen to correspond closely. A bivector and
a 2-form both deﬁne a 2-dimensional subspace of whatever manifold they live in.
A trivector and a 3-form both deﬁne a 3-dimensional subspace, etc. However as
mentioned in Sect.3.2, kk-blades can be easier to visualise, as the magnitude of a kk-
blade is akk-dimensional volume. It can therefore often be easier to think of how the
wedge products ofkk-forms behave by visualising them askk-blades instead. However
we visualise them, it is clear that in nn dimensions a kk-blade (or kk-form) deﬁnes not
only a kk-dimensional subspace, but also an left parenthesis n minus k right parenthesis(n −k)-dimensional subspace which is
the set of directions not spanned by the kk-blade (or kk-form) under consideration.
This latter subspace is said to be dual to the former. In fact the discussion in Sect.3.2
invoked a speciﬁc example of the concept of duality, namely a mapping between
bivectors in a spacetime plane (i.e. a two-dimensional plane embedded in a four-
dimensional manifold) and bivectors in the plane deﬁned by the other two spacetime
directions. Thus duality is a notion that emerges naturally from the construction of
the space ofkk-blades, and likewise from the construction of the space of differential
forms, on an nn-dimensional manifold upper MM.
Consider the case ofkk-blades in three dimensions. The antisymmetry of the wedge
product means that the unit trivector e Subscript i j k Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript j Baseline e Subscript kei jk = eie jek picks up a factor of negative 1−1 each
time the order of any two of its factors is swapped, hence e Subscript i j k Baseline equals minus e Subscript i k jei jk = −eikj, etc. and
so the unit trivector is a geometrical representation of the antisymmetric tensorepsilon Subscript i j kϵi jk.
Multiplying a vector by the unit trivector yields a bivector, and multiplying a bivector
by the unit trivector yields a vector (Fig. B.1). To see why, consider the familiar
cross product. Any two vectors ModifyingAbove u With right arrow comma ModifyingAbove v With right arrow element of double struck upper R cubed→u, →v ∈R3 (that are not parallel to each other) span
a two-dimensional subspace of double struck upper R cubedR3. Using these two vectors we construct a third
vector ModifyingAbove w With right arrow equals ModifyingAbove a With right arrow times ModifyingAbove b With right arrow →w = →a × →b, where the components of ModifyingAbove w With right arrow →w are given by w Subscript i Baseline equals epsilon Subscript i j k Baseline u Subscript j Baseline v Subscript kwi = ϵi jku jvk (and we
remind the reader that summation is performed over any repeated indices, as the
raising or lowering of indices is irrelevant indouble struck upper R Superscript upper NRN). This construction is taught to us in
elementary algebra courses, but never quite seemed to make complete sense because
it seemed to be peculiar to three dimensions. The productModifyingAbove u With right arrow times ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u × →v is a vector which is
Fig.B.1 The unit trivectore 123e123 allows us to explore duality in three dimensions. When we take the
Clifford product, indicated here by diamond , of the unit trivector with a vector, the part of e 123e123 parallel
to the vector yields a scalar factor via the dot product, and a factor of zero via the wedge product
part. This leaves us with a bivector perpendicular to the original vector (left). Likewise the Clifford
product ofe 123e123 with a bivector yields a vector (right). In each case the bivector and vector are dual
to each other, since each spans the directions the other doesn’t. Duality is therefore an extension
of the concept of orthogonality. For a four-dimensional object, the dual would be taken withe 1234e1234,
the dual of a vector would be a trivector, and the dual of a bivector would be another bivector

perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the vectorsModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u andModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v. But this plane is the same
one that the wedge productModifyingAbove With right arrow u and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v lies in. If we take the Clifford product ofModifyingAbove With right arrow u and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v with
the unit 3-vector, e 1 and e 2 and e 3 equals e 123e1 ∧e2 ∧e3 = e123 we are left with a vector that is perpendicular
to the plane of ModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v, and which equals minus left parenthesis ModifyingAbove u With right arrow times ModifyingAbove v With right arrow right parenthesis−(→u × →v). Why? Because the components
ofModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v parallel with components of the unit trivector yield scalars, leaving only the
components perpendicular toModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→u ∧→v, as we can see by expanding the Clifford product

where in the third line we have dealt with the excessively-indexed terms
e 12312 equals e 1 e 2 e 3 e 1 e 2e12312 = e1e2e3e1e2 etc. by using the antisymmetry of the product of dissimilar
terms e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript j Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline and e Subscript j Baseline equals minus e Subscript j Baseline and e Subscript i Baseline equals minus e Subscript j Baseline e Subscript ieie j = ei ∧e j = −e j ∧ei = −e jei to rearrange the basis vector terms, so
that we may eliminate some of them using e Subscript i Baseline e Subscript i Baseline equals e Subscript i Baseline dot e Subscript i Baseline equals 1eiei = ei · ei = 1. We also ﬁnd that the
wedge product of ModifyingAbove u With right arrow→u and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow→v has components left parenthesis ModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow right parenthesis Subscript i j Baseline equals u Subscript left bracket i Baseline v Subscript j right bracket(→u ∧→v)i j = u[iv j].
This allows us to view the cross product as a three-dimensional special case
of a procedure that can be performed in any number of dimensions. This pro-
cedure is “forming the dual”. We can say that the cross product of two vectors
in three dimensions is (up to a sign) the dual of the wedge product, and write
left parenthesis ModifyingAbove u With right arrow times ModifyingAbove v With right arrow right parenthesis equals star left parenthesis ModifyingAbove u With right arrow and ModifyingAbove v With right arrow right parenthesis(→u × →v) = ⋆(→u ∧→v).
This concept can be generalised tonn dimensions. In the language of multivectors,
it involves taking the Clifford product with the unit nn-blade e 1 e 2 ellipsis e Subscript n Baseline equals e Subscript 12 ellipsis n Baselinee1e2 . . . en = e12...n.
Re-worded in the language of differential forms, any kk-form upper F Superscript a 1 a 2 ellipsis a Super Subscript k SuperscriptFa1a2...ak, deﬁned on
an nn dimensional manifold upper MM, can be mapped to an (n minus kn −k)-form left parenthesis star upper F Superscript a 1 a 2 ellipsis a Super Subscript n minus k Superscript Baseline right parenthesis(⋆Fa1a2...an−k) by

From now on we will focus onkk-forms rather thankk-blades. But their equivalence,
and the geometric interpretation arising from this, should be kept in mind. It should
be clear that innn dimensions there exists one unit 0-form,5 nn unit 1-forms,n left parenthesis n minus 1 right parenthesisn(n −1)
unit 2-forms, etc. with the number of unit kk-forms increasing as kk approaches n divided by 2n/2
but decreasing as kk exceeds n divided by 2n/2. A similar result is true for kk-blades. We let Superscript n Baseline normal upper Omega Subscript knΩk
5 The reader is reminded that a kk-form is a scalar-valued function—i.e. a mapping that takes kk
vectors as arguments and returns a scalar. When we refer to a “unit” 0-form, we simply mean that
we intend all scalars to be regarded as multiples of the value this form returns when provided with
no vectors as arguments, so we can conveniently think of the unit 0-form itself as the scalar 1.

Field Strength and the Exterior Derivative
Returning our attention to the exterior derivative, recall Eq. (B.8) and the discussion
that followed, from which we recognise that the exterior derivative of a kk-form is a
left parenthesis k plus 1 right parenthesis(k + 1)-form. This feature of the exterior derivative allows us to encapsulate several
familiar differential operators in one.
The exterior derivative of a scalar (or more generally, a scalar-valued function
of several variables) is a 1-form. This turns out to be equivalent to the result from
elementary calculus that the gradient of a scalar-valued function is a vector. Now
consider a 1-form in three dimensions, alpha equals alpha 1 d x Superscript 1 Baseline plus alpha 2 d x squared alpha 3 d x cubedα = α1dx1 + α2dx2α3dx3. The exterior

throughout the wider literature to denote the space of products ofkk vectors. Forms can be regarded
as the elements of a vector space, so this notation is general enough to be—strictly speaking—valid.

we see that whenalphaα is a 1-form,d alphadα is equivalent to the curl of a 1-blade (vector) that
has the same components as alphaα.
Taking the next logical step we ﬁnd that the exterior derivative of a 2-form is a
3-form. In three dimensions a 2-form can (as above) be equated to a vector, while
a 3-form, proportional to d x Superscript 1 and d x squared and d x cubeddx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3 can be equated (again, via the concept
of duality) to a scalar. The divergence of a vector ﬁeld is a scalar, and so it should
come as no surprise to ﬁnd that the exterior derivative of a 2-form is equivalent to
the divergence of a vector ﬁeld.
Thus the exterior derivative embodies and generalises several familiar differential
operators. Part of the beauty of this approach is that the exterior derivative “takes
care of” deciding which differential operator to apply in a given situation, and so
the use of indices to keep track of whether we’re operating on a scalar, vector, or
other quantity, and which component thereof, loses its importance. For example, the
previously-introduced identity d left parenthesis d f right parenthesis equals 0d(d f ) = 0 embodies the identities
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column nabla times left parenthesis nabla f right parenthesis equals 0 2nd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column nabla dot left parenthesis nabla times f right parenthesis equals 0 EndLayout ∇× (∇f ) = 0
∇· (∇× f ) = 0
and works appropriately to whatever type of object f f happens to be.
The gradient, divergence, and curl occur speciﬁcally in the classical theory of
electromagnetism. We have already seen (Sect.3.2) how the electromagnetic ﬁeld
strength tensor can be written in term of bivectors (that is to say, 22-blades). We
can similarly write the ﬁeld strength in terms of 2-forms. To do so we construct a
magnetic ﬁeld 2-form, an electric ﬁeld 22-form, and a ﬁeld-strength 22-form which is
their sum;

(B.11)
where d x Superscript 0 Baseline equals d tdx0 = dt. Comparing this with Eq. (3.21) the equivalence of the two formu-
lations is clear. Applying the exterior derivative to upper BB and writing d upper B Subscript ad Ba as the total

d upper B Subscript a Baseline equals StartFraction partial differential upper B Subscript a Baseline Over partial differential t EndFraction d t plus StartFraction partial differential upper B Subscript a Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction d x Superscript 1 Baseline plus StartFraction partial differential upper B Subscript a Baseline Over partial differential x squared EndFraction d x squared plus StartFraction partial differential upper B Subscript a Baseline Over partial differential x cubed EndFraction d x cubedd Ba = ∂Ba

where StartSet a comma b comma c EndSet{a, b, c} correspond to cyclic permutations of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSet{1, 2, 3}, we have used
d x Superscript a Baseline and d x Superscript a Baseline equals 0dxa ∧dxa = 0 to simplify between the ﬁrst line and the second, and there is a
sum overa equals 1 comma 2 comma 3a = 1, 2, 3 in the last term on the second line. The ﬁrst term on the second
line is simply proportional to the time derivative of upper BB which we will write as partial differential Subscript t Baseline upper B∂t B,
while the second term is equivalent to the divergence of upper BB, which we will write as
d Subscript x Baseline upper Bdx B as it is the exterior derivative restricted to the spatial directions.
Similarly we ﬁnd that in the exterior derivative of upper EE the terms proportional to
left parenthesis partial differential upper E Subscript a Baseline divided by partial differential t right parenthesis d t(∂Ea/∂t)dt vanish, and we are left with only d Subscript x Baseline upper Edx E terms which are proportional
to d tdt and correspond with the curl of upper EE, as per our previous result regarding the
(three-dimensional) exterior derivative of a 2-form. The exterior derivative ofupper FF can
therefore be written
d upper F equals d Subscript x Baseline upper B plus left parenthesis StartFraction partial differential upper B Subscript a Baseline Over partial differential t EndFraction d x Superscript b Baseline and d x Superscript c Baseline and d t plus d Subscript x Baseline upper E right parenthesisdF = dx B +
(∂Ba
∂t dxb ∧dxc ∧dt + dx E
)
(B.14)
where the term in brackets is proportional to d tdt and the other term is not.
Equation (B.14) is therefore equivalent to two separate equations, and setting
d upper F equals 0dF = 0
(B.15)
requires that the divergence of upper BB and the bracketed term in Eq. (B.14) must each
be zero. Equation (B.15) is therefore equivalent to the two homogeneous Maxwell’s
equations.
In a similar fashion the inhomogeneous Maxwell’s equations can be written as
star d star upper F equals upper J⋆d⋆F = J
(B.16)
where the dual ﬁeld strength star upper F⋆F is found by swapping upper E Subscript i Baseline right arrow minus upper B Subscript iEi →−Bi and upper B Subscript i Baseline right arrow upper E Subscript iBi →Ei as
noted in Sect.3.2, and the current upper JJ is an appropriately-deﬁned 1-form.
The dual operation has another nice trick up its sleeve. Consider kk-blades again,
speciﬁcally a 1-bladeu equals u Superscript 1 Baseline e 1 plus u squared e 2 plus u cubed e 3u = u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3. The dual of this can be easily shown
to take the form star u equals u Superscript 1 Baseline e 23 plus u squared e 31 plus u cubed e 12⋆u = u1e23 + u2e31 + u3e12. We keep in mind that the wedge
product of any terms proportional to the same basis vector will be zero, while for
orthogonal basis vectors the wedge product is equivalent to the Clifford product (e.g.
e 1 and e 31 equals 0e1 ∧e31 = 0, and e 1 and e 23 equals e 123e1 ∧e23 = e123). It is then a fairly easy exercise to show that
u and star u equals left parenthesis u Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared e 123 plus left parenthesis u squared right parenthesis squared e 123 plus left parenthesis u cubed right parenthesis squared e 123 periodu ∧⋆u = (u1)2e123 + (u2)2e123 + (u3)2e123 .
(B.17)
This is clearly proportional to (in fact, the dual of) the dot product of uu with itself.
It is easy to visualise how this arises, even without doing the calculation explicitly.
Recalling that duality is a generalisation of the concept of orthogonality, the proper-
ties of the wedge product ensure that only those terms which are dual to each other
(such as e 1e1 and e 23e23) will be non-zero. The reader may conﬁrm for themselves that
an equivalent result is found if we replace the 1-blade uu with a 1-form instead. This
suggests that we can regard u and star vu ∧⋆v as equivalent to the inner product of uu and vv.

162
Appendix B:Blades,Forms,and Duality
Extending this line of reasoning, if we write the ﬁeld strengthupper F Subscript mu nuFμν in terms of bivec-
tors as in Eq. (3.21) and the dual ﬁeld strengthstar upper F Subscript mu nu⋆Fμν deﬁned in Eq. (3.22) equivalently,
then we ﬁnd that their wedge product upper F and star upper FF ∧⋆F is equivalent to one half upper F Subscript mu nu Baseline upper F Superscript mu nu 1
2 Fμν Fμν. Naturally
the same result applies if we write the ﬁeld strength in terms of 2-forms instead of
bivectors.
The discussion of classical electromagnetism is somewhat peripheral to formu-
lating a theory of quantum gravity. It is however, for the reader unfamiliar with the
language of differential forms, useful for illustrating the way in which the notation
of differential forms is used, and hints at how this notation can be generalised to
any number of dimensions, and arbitrary manifolds without the need to juggle a
profusion of indices. It also, hopefully, lends plausibility to the use of index-free
formulations of various quantities such as the actions arising in gauge ﬁeld theories
and formulations of GR, which will be examined further in the following sections
and especially AppendixG.
B.5
Spacetime Duality
From the discussion above and in Sect.B.3, it should be apparent that in four dimen-
sions the dual of any two-form is another two-form
star upper F Subscript alpha beta Baseline equals one half epsilon Subscript alpha beta Baseline Superscript mu nu Baseline upper F Subscript mu nu⋆Fαβ = 1
2ϵαβμν Fμν
(B.18)
(also compare this with Eq. (3.22), and as noted there, the quantity deﬁned on the
plane between any pair of spacetime axes is associated to the quantity deﬁned on
the plane between the other two spacetime axes). It is due to this property of even-
dimensional manifolds that we can deﬁne self-dual and anti-self-dualkk-forms, where
a form is self-/anti-self-dual if
star upper F equals plus or minus upper F period⋆F = ±F.
(B.19)
Given an arbitrary 2-form upper G Subscript mu nuGμν its self-dual part upper G Superscript plusG+ and anti-self-dual part upper G Superscript minusG−
are given by
upper G Superscript plus Baseline equals StartFraction upper G plus star upper G Over 2 alpha EndFraction comma upper G Superscript minus Baseline equals StartFraction upper G minus star upper G Over 2 beta EndFraction commaG+ = G + ⋆G
2α
,
G−= G −⋆G
2β
,
wherealphaα andbetaβ are constants we have introduced for later convenience. We can check
that
star left parenthesis upper G plus or minus star upper G right parenthesis equals plus or minus left parenthesis upper G plus or minus star upper G right parenthesis⋆(G ± ⋆G) = ±(G ± ⋆G)
(B.20)
because star star equals bold 1⋆⋆= 1 in a Euclidean background. In other words star upper G Superscript plus Baseline equals upper G Superscript plus⋆G+ = G+ and
star upper G Superscript minus Baseline equals minus upper G Superscript minus⋆G−= −G−, which is precisely the deﬁnition of (anti-)self-duality. Thus any 2-
form can always be written as a linear-sum of a self-dual and an anti-self-dual piece
upper G equals alpha upper G Superscript plus Baseline plus beta upper G Superscript minus Baseline comma star upper G equals alpha upper G Superscript plus Baseline minus beta upper G Superscript minus Baseline periodG = αG+ + βG−,
⋆G = αG+ −βG−.

Appendix B:Blades,Forms,and Duality

The above results hold for a Euclidean spacetime. For a Lorentzian background
we would instead have star star equals negative bold 1⋆⋆= −1 and the dual of a two-form is given by
star upper F Subscript alpha beta Baseline equals StartFraction bold i Over 2 EndFraction epsilon Subscript alpha beta Baseline Superscript gamma delta Baseline upper F Subscript gamma delta⋆Fαβ = i
2ϵαβγδFγδ
(B.21)
and the statement of (anti-)self-duality becomes
star upper F equals plus or minus bold i upper F⋆F = ±iF
(B.22)
with the self-dual and anti-self-dual pieces of a two-form upper GG being given by
upper G Superscript plus Baseline equals left parenthesis upper G plus star bold i upper G right parenthesis divided by 2 alphaG+ = (G + ⋆iG)/2α and upper G Superscript minus Baseline equals left parenthesis upper G minus star bold i upper G right parenthesis divided by 2 betaG−= (G −⋆iG)/2β.
B.6
Lie-Algebra Duality
The previous section discussed self-duality in the context of tensors with spacetime
indices upper T Superscript alpha beta ellipsis Baseline Subscript gamma delta ellipsisT αβ...γδ.... In gauge theories based on non-trivial Lie algebras we also have
tensors with Lie algebra indices, such as the curvature upper F Subscript mu nu Baseline Superscript upper I upper JFμν I J of the gauge connec-
tion upper A Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper I upper JAμI J where upper I comma upper JI, J label generators of the relevant Lie algebra.. The dual of the
connection can then be deﬁned using the completely antisymmetric tensor acting on
the Lie algebra indices, as in
star upper A Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper I upper J Baseline equals one half epsilon Superscript upper I upper J Subscript upper K upper L Baseline upper A Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper K upper L Baseline period⋆AμI J = 1
2ϵI J K L AμK L.
(B.23)
B.7
Yang-Mills
Let us illustrate the utility of the notion of self-duality by examining the classical
Yang-Mills action. We write this in a manner consistent with the discussion at the
end of Sect.B.4,
upper S Subscript YM Baseline equals integral Underscript upper R Superscript 4 Baseline Endscripts trace left bracket upper F and star upper F right bracketSYM =
 
R4 Tr [F ∧⋆F]
Varying this action with respect to the connection gives us the equations of motion7
d upper F equals 0 comma d star upper F equals 0 commadF = 0 ,
d⋆F = 0 ,
which are satisﬁed if upper F equals plus or minus star upper FF = ±⋆F, i.e. if the gauge curvature is self-dual or anti-self-
dual. Thus for self-/anti-self-dual solutions the Yang-Mills action reduces to
upper S Subscript YM Superscript plus or minus Baseline equals plus or minus integral Underscript upper R Superscript 4 Baseline Endscripts trace left bracket upper F and upper F right bracketS±
YM = ±
 
R4 Tr [F ∧F]
which is a topological invariant of the given manifold and is known as the Pontryagin
index. Here theplus or minus± superscript denotes whether the ﬁeld is self-dual or anti-self-dual.

Geometrical Interpretation
Given any (Lie algebra valued) two-form upper F Subscript a b Superscript upper IF I
ab (where upper I comma upper J comma upper K ellipsisI, J, K . . . are Lie algebra
indices) we can obtain an element of the Lie algebra by contracting it with a member
of the basis of the space of two-forms, left brace d x Superscript i Baseline and d x Superscript j Baseline right brace{dxi ∧dx j} where x Superscript ixi denotes the i thith vector
and not the components of a vector. The components are suppressed in the differen-
tial form notation as explained in the preceding sections. The resulting Lie algebra
element is
normal upper Phi Superscript upper I Baseline equals upper F Superscript upper I Baseline Subscript a b Baseline d x Superscript a Baseline and d x Superscript bϕI = F I ab dxa ∧dxb
andnormal upper Phi Superscript upper IϕI is the ﬂux of the ﬁeld strength through the two-dimensional surface spanned
by StartSet d x Superscript a Baseline comma d x Superscript b Baseline EndSet{dxa, dxb}.
We can also deﬁne
star normal upper Phi Superscript upper I Baseline equals star upper F Superscript upper I Baseline Subscript a b Baseline d x Superscript a Baseline and d x Superscript b Baseline equals one half epsilon Subscript a b Superscript c d Baseline upper F Superscript upper I Baseline Subscript c d Baseline d x Superscript a Baseline and d x Superscript b⋆ϕI = ⋆F I ab dxa ∧dxb = 1
2ϵabcd F I cd dxa ∧dxb
which implies that star normal upper Phi Superscript upper I Baseline Subscript a b Baseline equals one half epsilon Subscript a b Superscript c d Baseline normal upper Phi Superscript upper I Baseline Subscript c d⋆ϕI ab = 1
2ϵabcdϕI cd, i.e. the ﬂux of the ﬁeld strength through
the aa-bb plane is equal to the ﬂux of the dual ﬁeld through the cc-dd plane.

(Anti) Self-dual Connections
When we say that the connection is (anti-)self-dual, explicitly this means that
upper A Subscript mu Superscript upper I upper J Baseline equals plus or minus star upper A Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper I upper J Baseline equals plus or minus StartFraction bold i Over 2 EndFraction epsilon Superscript upper I upper J Subscript upper K upper L Baseline upper A Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper K upper L Baseline periodAI J

Let us now show the relation between the (anti-)self-dual four-dimensional connec-

One would like to be able to determine the data required to embed the spatial hyper-
surfaces normal upper Sigma∑within the 4-manifold script upper MM, given the spacetime metric g Subscript a bgab and the unit

Eq. (4.16) plays the role of the intrinsic metric (or “curvature”) of normal upper Sigma∑. The quantity
k Subscript a bkab is the extrinsic curvature ofnormal upper Sigma∑determined by the particular form of its embedding
in script upper MM. In order to deﬁne k Subscript a bkab we ﬁrst need to determine the form of the covariant

There is nothing mysterious about (D.2). As shown by the electric ﬁeld example
above, it simply measures how the vector ﬁeldn Superscript ana changes from point to point as we
move around the spatial manifold normal upper Sigma∑.
D.2
Extrinsic Curvature
The extrinsic curvature of a given manifold is a mathematical measure of the manner
in which it is embedded in a manifold of higher dimension. As illustrated in Fig. 4.3, a
two-dimensional cylinder embedded indouble struck upper R cubedR3 has zero intrinsic curvature, but non-zero
extrinsic curvature. The normal at each point of the cylinder is a three-dimensional
vector n Subscript bnb and this vector changes as one moves around the cylindrical surface if
the extrinsic curvature of the surface is non-zero. Thus, the simplest deﬁnition for a
tensorial quantity which measures this change is given by
k Subscript a b Baseline equals upper D Subscript a Baseline n Subscript b Baseline equals h Subscript a Baseline Superscript c h Subscript b Baseline Superscript d Baseline nabla Subscript c Baseline n Subscript dkab = Danb = hachbd∇cnd
(D.3)
whereupper D Subscript aDa is the covariant spatial derivative deﬁned in Sect.D.1. This quantity turns
out to be symmetric. In order to see this ([6, Sect. 3.2.2.2]), note that given two spatial
vector ﬁeldsupper Y Superscript aY a andupper Z Superscript aZa, their commutatorleft bracket upper Y comma upper Z right bracket Superscript a Baseline equals upper Y Superscript b Baseline nabla Subscript b Baseline upper Z Superscript a Baseline minus upper Z Superscript b Baseline nabla Subscript b Baseline upper Y Superscript a[Y, Z]a = Y b∇bZa −Zb∇bY a will also
be spatial, i.e. n Subscript a Baseline left bracket upper Y comma upper Z right bracket Superscript a Baseline equals 0na[Y, Z]a = 0. Since n Subscript a Baseline upper Y Superscript a Baseline equals 0naY a = 0, by applying the product rule to
nabla Subscript b Baseline n Subscript a Baseline upper Y Superscript a Baseline equals 0∇bnaY a = 0 it follows thatn Subscript a Baseline nabla Subscript b Baseline upper Y Superscript a Baseline equals minus upper Y Superscript a Baseline nabla Subscript b Baseline n Subscript ana∇bY a = −Y a∇bna. The equivalent result holds if we
replace upper Y Superscript aY a by upper Z Superscript aZa. Substituting in these results we ﬁnd that

where we have used the summation over indices to swap the labelsaa,bb in one of the
terms. Since upper Y Superscript a Baseline comma upper Z Superscript aY a, Za are purely spatial, this implies that (the spatial projection of)
nabla Subscript a Baseline n Subscript b Baseline equals nabla Subscript b Baseline n Subscript a∇anb = ∇bna. Thus the extrinsic curvature of cubed normal upper Sigma3∑can be written as

Canonical Momentum in the ADM Formulation
Recall that the time vector ﬁeld is written in terms of the lapse upper NN, shift upper N Superscript muN μ and
the normal to the hypersurface n Superscript munμ, so that t Superscript mu Baseline equals upper N n Superscript mu Baseline plus upper N Superscript mutμ = Nnμ + N μ (Eq. 4.11). We wish to
write down the explicit form of the Lie derivative of a one-index upper X Subscript aXa and two-index
object h Subscript a bhab, with respect to a vector ﬁeld v Subscript ava. Conveniently this is already present
in Eqs. (E.2)–(E.4)! As we may expect, when a vector ﬁeld is a sum of two
(or more) vector ﬁelds (as for the time-evolution ﬁeld above), the Lie deriva-
tive with respect to that ﬁeld decomposes into the sum of Lie derivatives with

Appendix D:ADM Variables

respect to each of the components ﬁelds. So if
upper X Subscript a Baseline equals u Subscript a Baseline plus v Subscript a Baseline plus w Subscript aXa = ua + va + wa, then
pound sign Subscript upper X Baseline left bracket upper T right bracket equals pound sign Subscript u Baseline left bracket upper T right bracket plus pound sign Subscript v Baseline left bracket upper T right bracket plus pound sign Subscript w Baseline left bracket upper T right bracket£X[T ] = £u[T ] + £v[T ] + £w[T ], where upper TT is the arbitrary tensor whose Lie
derivative we want to ﬁnd. You can see this directly from Eq. (E.1) by
writing the ﬁeld X as a sum of other vector ﬁelds. When upper TT is a vector, then
pound sign Subscript upper X Baseline upper T equals left bracket upper X comma upper T right bracket equals left bracket u comma upper T right bracket plus left bracket v comma upper T right bracket plus left bracket w comma upper T right bracket£XT = [X, T ] = [u, T ] + [v, T ] + [w, T ] and so on (left bracket upper A comma upper B right bracket[A, B] is the commutator of
two vector ﬁelds as in Eq. E.2).
There are two steps involved in deriving the form of the canonical momentum.
First is to prove the identity (4.25). The second is to use that result to perform the
functional derivative of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangianupper L Subscript EHLEH with respect to theModifyingAbove h With dot Subscript a b˙hab
to obtain Eq. (4.26).
First, we wish to show that pound sign Subscript t Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript a b Baseline equals 2 upper N k Subscript a b Baseline plus pound sign Subscript upper N Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript a b£→thab = 2Nkab + £ →Nhab, which we can do by ﬁnd-
ing a suitable expression for pound sign Subscript t Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript mu nu£→thμν, and then restricting the indices to the range
mu comma nu right arrow a comma b element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetμ, ν →a, b ∈{1, 2, 3}. So, sincet Subscript mu Baseline equals upper N n Subscript mu Baseline plus upper N Subscript mutμ = Nnμ + Nμ, using the above mentioned addi-
tive property of Lie derivatives, we havepound sign Subscript t Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript mu nu Baseline equals pound sign Subscript upper N n Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript mu nu Baseline plus pound sign Subscript upper N Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript mu nu£→thμν = £N →nhμν + £ →Nhμν. The second term
is present (with indices restricted, as just discussed) in Eq. (4.25). It now remains to
be shown that 2 upper N k Subscript a b Baseline equals pound sign Subscript upper N n Sub Superscript right arrow Baseline h Subscript a b2Nkab = £N →nhab.
ThesimplestapproachistorecognisethattheLiederivativeofametrictensor with
respect to the vector ﬁeldModifyingAbove n With right arrow→n (we shall neglect the factor ofupper NN at ﬁrst, but re-introduce
it shortly) is given by Eq. (E.4), which we restate for convenience:
pound sign Subscript n Sub Superscript right arrow Subscript Baseline h Subscript mu nu Baseline equals nabla Subscript mu Baseline n Subscript nu Baseline plus nabla Subscript nu Baseline n Subscript mu Baseline period£→nhμν = ∇μnν + ∇νnμ.
The above equation holds true only when the derivative operator nabla Subscript mu Baseline∇μ is compatible
with the metrich Subscript mu nuhμν whose Lie derivative we wish to determine (that is,nabla Subscript mu Baseline h Subscript mu nu Baseline equals 0∇μhμν = 0).
Hence we restrict ourselves to the spatial components and switch to the correct
notation upper DD for the spatial derivative operator instead of nabla∇. Then by deﬁnition (D.4)
we see that the Lie derivative of the spatial metric is twice the extrinsic curvature of
cubed normal upper Sigma3∑,
pound sign Subscript n Sub Superscript right arrow Subscript Baseline h Subscript a b Baseline equals upper D Subscript a Baseline n Subscript b Baseline plus upper D Subscript b Baseline n Subscript a Baseline equals 2 k Subscript a b Baseline period£→nhab = Danb + Dbna = 2kab.
(D.5)
Now we equate this expression with the deﬁnition of the Lie derivative of a rank-2
tensor, Eq. (E.3), and follow the treatment of [6, Sect. 3.2.2.2]:

where in the second line we have multiplied and divided by the scale factor upper NN. In
the third line we have used the fact that n Superscript c Baseline h Subscript a c Baseline equals 0nchac = 0 to move upper NN inside the deriva-
tive operator. In going from the third to the fourth, we have used Eq. (E.3) in
reverse, along with the relationship between the lapse, shift and time-evolution ﬁelds,
upper N n Superscript a Baseline equals t Superscript a Baseline minus upper N Superscript aNna = ta −Na. The ﬁfth line is obtained by using the linearity of the Lie derivative.
At this point we may readily rearrange the expression to obtain Eq. (4.25). In the sixth
we have, in the words of Bojowald, “smuggled in” two factors ofhh knowing thatk Subscript a bkab
is spatial to begin with. In the seventh, the spatial projection h Subscript a Baseline Superscript c h Subscript b Baseline Superscript d Baseline pound sign Subscript t Baseline h Subscript c d Baseline equals ModifyingAbove h With dot Subscript a bhachbd£thcd = ˙hab is
identiﬁed as the “time-derivative” of the spatial metric. We leave the remaining step

Lie Derivative
The Lie derivative pound sign Subscript upper X£X of a tensor upper TT is the change in upper TT evaluated along the ﬂow
generated by the vector ﬁeld ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow →X on a manifold. When upper TT is simply a function upper T identical to fT ≡f
on the manifold, the Lie derivative reduces to the directional derivative of f f along
upper XX

wheress parametrises the points along the curve generated byupper XX. This fact is related to
the interpretation of the differentiald xdx as a component of a 1-form, and the derivative
operator partial differential Subscript x Baseline equals partial differential slash partial differential x∂x = ∂/∂x as a component of a vector ﬁeld (see Sect. B.2 for more detail
if this interpretation is unfamiliar.) When the connection is torsion-free, we may
replace partial differential Subscript alpha Baseline∂α with nabla Subscript alpha Baseline∇α.

As in Sect.4.2, we assume that our spacetime manifold script upper MM is topologically
normal upper Sigma Subscript t Baseline times double struck upper R∑t × R, where normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t are spatial (3D) manifolds which “foliate” script upper MM. We identify a
vector ﬁeld t Superscript mu Baseline equals upper N n Superscript mu Baseline plus upper N Superscript mutμ = Nnμ + N μ as the generator of “time-evolution”, written in terms
of the purely time-like normal vector n Superscript munμ at each point of normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t, the lapse function upper NN
and the purely spatial “shift” vector-ﬁeld upper N Superscript muN μ.
In the metric formalism, we started by writing the 4-metricg Subscript mu nugμν in terms of a spatial
componenth Subscript mu nuhμν8 and a time-like componentn Subscript mu Baseline n Subscript nunμnν such thatg Subscript mu nu Baseline equals h Subscript mu Baseline h Subscript nu Baseline minus n Subscript mu Baseline n Subscript nugμν = hμhν −nμnν. In
contrast, here we don’t have a metric! Instead we have the volume form epsilon Superscript mu nu alpha betaϵμναβ and
the tetrad ﬁeld e Subscript mu Baseline Superscript upper IeμI.
We proceed by noting that, ﬁrstly, on a pp-dimensional manifold, the space of
pp-forms is one-dimensional, as per Sect.B.3. In other words any four-form upper L Superscript mu nu alpha betaLμναβ
deﬁned on script upper MM is proportional to any other four-form on script upper MM. Second, the wedge or
antisymmetric outer product of a three-form and a one-form gives a four-form. Now,
on the 3-manifold normal upper Sigma Subscript t∑t, there exists a volume three-form epsilon Superscript a b cϵabc or epsilon Superscript alpha beta gammaϵαβγ using four-
dimensional indices. One can take the wedge product of epsilon Superscript alpha beta gammaϵαβγ with the one-form t Superscript deltatδ
8 Recalling once again that even thoughmu comma nuμ, ν are four-dimensional indices,h Subscript mu nuhμν itself is purely spatial,
because it satisﬁesh Subscript mu nu Baseline n Superscript nu Baseline equals 0hμνnν = 0.

that

Since our conﬁguration variable is the connectionupper A Subscript alpha Baseline Superscript upper I upper JAαI J, the canonical momentum
can be read off the coefﬁcient multiplying the time-derivative (or in this case the Lie
derivative with respect to the time-evolution vector ﬁeld) of the connection in the
Palatini Lagrangian. Thus the canonical momentum is the triad ﬁeld upper E Superscript alpha Baseline Subscript upper I upper JEαI J.
The conﬁguration variables of our theory are upper N comma upper N Superscript alpha Baseline comma left parenthesis upper A dot t right parenthesis comma upper A Subscript alpha Baseline Superscript upper I upper JN, N α, (A · t), AαI J, and upper E Superscript alpha Baseline Subscript upper I upper JEαI J.
However, since the Lagrangian (F.6), does not contain any time-derivatives of
upper N comma upper N Superscript alpha Baseline and left parenthesis upper A dot t right parenthesisN, N αand (A · t), these variables act as Lagrange multipliers and their respective
coefﬁcients must therefore be constant on the physical phase space.

Despite the remarkable fact that the Ashtekar variables allow us to ﬁnd an exact
solution of the gravitational Hamiltonian for arbitrary geometries, there are sev-
eral technical problems with treating the Kodama state as a valid wavefunction for
quantum gravity as was ﬁrst pointed out by Witten [8]. In recent work, Randono [9–
11] has suggested that these problems can be addressed by working with a suitable
modiﬁcation of the original Kodama state.

Peter-WeylTheorem
The crucial step involved in going from graph states with edges labelled by
holonomies to graph states with edges labelled by group representations (angular
momenta) is the Peter-Weyl theorem. This theorem allows the generalization of the
notion of Fourier transforms to functions deﬁned on a group manifold for compact,
semi-simple Lie groups.
Given a group script upper GG, let upper D Superscript j Baseline left parenthesis g right parenthesis Subscript m nD j(g)mn be the matrix representation of any group element
g element of script upper Gg ∈G. Then we have (see Chap.8 of [12]).
Theorem H.1 The irreducible representation matrices upper D Superscript j Baseline left parenthesis g right parenthesisD j(g) for the group SU(2)
satisfy the following orthonormality condition

(H.1)
Here n Subscript jn j is the dimensionality of the j jth representation of upper GG and n Subscript upper GnG is the order
of the group. For a ﬁnite group this is simply the number of elements of the group.
For example, for double struck upper Z 2Z2, n Subscript upper G Baseline equals 2nG = 2. However a continuous or Lie group such as upper S upper U left parenthesis 2 right parenthesisSU(2)
has an uncountable inﬁnity of group elements. In such cases n Subscript upper GnG corresponds to the
“volume” of the group manifold.

Regge Calculus

“in 2+1 dimensions” from a discrete version thereof given by decomposing the
spacetime manifold into a collection of tetrahedral simplices [13,14], with curvature
corresponding to an excess or shortage of angle traversed around each vertex. For
instance, as discussed in Sect. 6.1 a plane 2D surface can be tiled with equilateral
triangles, with six such triangles meeting at each vertex. If one attempted to ﬁt in
a seventh triangle around a given vertex, thereby effectively increasing the number
of degrees in a full circle, the only way it could be accommodated would be by
curving the resulting surface. Similarly if one attempted to omit a triangle, thereby
reducing the number of degrees in a full circle, the only way to join the edges of
adjacent triangles would be to curve the surface they formed (clearly the addition or
omission of more triangles leads to more extreme curvature). Hence when many such
tetrahedral simplices are joined together, curvature of the resulting discrete manifold
is represented by positive or negative deﬁcit angles.

Fibre Bundles
Much of the mathematical discussion about quantum gravity (especially the formu-
lation of BF theory) is presented in the language of ﬁbre bundles. This language can
seem fairly abstract to the uninitiated. However it is important, and provides several
nice visualisations of the mappings associated to gauge transformations, connections,
and the like, so it is useful provide an overview of the topic.
As a ﬁrst step, consider two copies of the real number line, which we will refer to as
upper XX andupper YY. These are just one-dimensional vector spaces. We recognise that an ordinary
function of one variable, y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesisy = f (x) with x element of upper Xx ∈X and y element of upper Yy ∈Y is not simply a mapping
upper X right arrow upper YX →Y, but rather it is a mapping fromupper XX to a two-dimensional manifold consisting
of points labelled by the pairsleft parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis(x, y), hencef colon upper X right arrow upper X times upper Y f : X →X × Y. We recognise thatf left parenthesis x right parenthesis f (x)
deﬁnes the locus of points left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis element of upper X times upper Y(x, y) ∈X × Y satisfying the relationship y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesisy = f (x). It
is a simple matter to deﬁne an inverse mappingf Superscript negative 1 Baseline colon upper X times upper Y right arrow upper X f −1 : X × Y →X, for instance one
which “throws away” the yy value, left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis right arrow from bar x(x, y)  →x. This is simply the act of projecting
a point in upper X times upper YX × Y down to a point in upper XX.
Generalising these concepts, we can imagine a function which assigns elements
vv of a vector spaceupper VV to each point in a manifoldupper MM. For concreteness, imagineupper VV is
the space of vectors in two dimensions. We can represent this as a disk. Points in this
disk denote vectors, with the direction and distance of the point from the centre of
the disk indicating the direction and magnitude of the vector (Fig. J.1). There is one
copy ofupper VV associated to each pointx element of upper Mx ∈M. The space formed by “stacking together”
the disks associated with each point in the manifold isupper E equals upper M times upper VE = M × V , and is called the
total space. It is easy to deﬁne a mapping which takes any point inupper EE to a point inupper MM,
which is the generalisation of f Superscript negative 1 f −1, above. We denote such mappings pi colon upper E right arrow upper Mπ : E →M.
The set of all points in upper EE projected by piπ down to a given x element of upper Mx ∈M is the vector space
upper V Subscript xVx which we can think of as living at or, in some sense, “above” xx.
In general we would consider topological spaces rather than vector spaces specif-
ically, and so it is often sensible to replace upper VV by another symbol such as upper FF or upper E Subscript xEx,
but for our purposes it is sufﬁcient to stick to considering vector spaces, and so we
will retain the notation we have established.

Fig.J.1 We associate the vector spacesupper V Subscript pVp andupper V Subscript qVq to pointspp andqq in the manifoldupper MM. The mapping
piπ projects all points in a given vector space down to the associated point inupper MM (left). A sectionupper SS
through the “stack” of all vector spaces,upper M times upper VM × V , picks out a particular vectorv left parenthesis x right parenthesisv(x) in eachupper V Subscript xVx, and
associates this to the corresponding pointx element of upper Mx ∈M. A section therefore generalises the concept of a
function, and deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld on the manifoldupper MM (right)
Our choice to representupper VV as a disk is useful when talking about a two-dimensional
vector space, but in general a more abstract representation is used. We will therefore
adopt the usual practice of drawing upper EE as a sheet above the manifold upper MM, and repre-
senting upper V Subscript xVx as a vertical strip running through this sheet (Fig. J.2). The collection of
all such strips looks like a cluster of threads or ﬁbres, so we callupper V Subscript xVx a ﬁbre. Just as a
group is a set along with a binary operation (AppendixA), we refer to upper E equals upper M times upper FE = M × F
along with a mapping pi colon upper E right arrow upper Mπ : E →M as a “ﬁbre bundle”. The total space is the union
of all the ﬁbres,
upper E equals union Underscript x element of upper M Endscripts upper V Subscript x Baseline periodE =

x∈M
Vx .
(J.1)
In the cases under consideration, where the ﬁbres are vector spaces, we call the
ﬁbre bundle a “vector bundle”.9 Assigning a vector v left parenthesis x right parenthesis element of upper V Subscript xv(x) ∈Vx to each point x element of upper Mx ∈M
means picking a point inupper EE for eachxx. The locus of such points isupper SS, a section ofupper EE.
Choosing a section of upper EE deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld on upper MM. We are then naturally drawn
to consider the prospect of mappings between sections. Such mappings change one
vector at any given point to another vector at the same point. We refer to these as
endomorphisms. These are denoted End(upper VV ), and roughly speaking move us around
from one place inupper VV to another.10 The collection of endomorphisms associated to all
points in the manifold is called the “endomorphism bundle” End(upper EE). A sectionupper TT of
End(upper EE) deﬁnes a ﬁeld of endomorphisms over upper MM, which we can think of as linear
transformations acting on the vector ﬁeld deﬁned on upper MM. In other words, given a
vector ﬁeld onupper MM (given by a sectionupper SS ofupper EE), the sectionupper TT of End(upper EE) acts pointwise
on it to produce a new vector ﬁeld. Ifupper T left parenthesis p right parenthesis element of upper GT (p) ∈G, withupper GG being a group that provides

distraction from building a clear mental picture. See e.g. [2] for more details.

space in question.

Fig. J.2 Sections of upper EE determine vector ﬁelds on upper MM according to where they intersect the ﬁbres
such as upper V Subscript pVp and upper V Subscript qVq. Endomorphisms, shown by the curved arrows adjacent to upper V Subscript qVq, map between
sections such asupper S 1S1 andupper S 2S2 and are themselves elements of a vector space, namely the ﬁbre End(upper V Subscript qVq)

transformations of the vectors v element of upper Vv ∈V then we can think of gauge transformations as
sections of End(upper EE).
We should also note thatupper A Subscript muAμ, which we introduced in Eq. (3.4) in the context of the
covariant derivative, can be viewed as an End(upper EE)-valued 1-form. By this we mean
to recognise that the role of upper A Subscript muAμ is to tell us how a ﬁeld (i.e. a section of upper EE) deﬁned
on the manifold of interest changes when we move through the manifold in some
direction. Thus when supplied with a vector ﬁeld (deﬁning the direction of motion)
and a section upper SS of upper EE, the 1-form upper A Subscript muAμ contracts with the vector ﬁeld and enacts an
endomorphism upon upper SS to produce another ﬁeld, upper S primeS'.

Knots,Links,and the Kauffman
Bracket
Our discussion in the main text, speciﬁcally Sect.7.2.3, led us to consider closed
curves which may be linked together, winding around each other (or if framed, them-
selves) several times. If we think of such closed curves as embedded in a manifold
we can consider the prospect of distorting them and moving them around within the
manifold. However, in a background-independent theory, the concept of distorting a
curve loses its meaning—there is no metric against which to measure the positions of
different parts of the curve. We are therefore drawn to consider topological features
of such closed curves, or collections of closed curves, which would remain invariant
if the curves were moved or deformed.
This leads us into a fairly wide area of knot theory, of which we will only scratch
the surface. The reader may consult Chap.II.5 of [2], for instance, or speciﬁc texts
on knot theory for more details.
In the main text we referred to “closed curves”, as this terminology matches the
language we used in discussing Wilson loops and spin networks. For now though,
we will revert to the usual terminology of calling a closed curve a “knot”. A knot is
simply a 1-dimensional submanifold of double struck upper R cubedR3 deﬁned by a locus of points which can
be mapped to the circle upper S Superscript 1S1. In other words, if you started at some point in the knot
and moved from one point to another you would eventually return to your starting
point without having intersected any of the points you had previously visited along
the way. The simplest example is the unknot, which when projected intodouble struck upper R squaredR2 does not
cross itself at any point (Fig. K.1a). More complicated possibilities may occur, such
as the trefoil knot, Fig. K.1b, which crosses itself three times when projected into
double struck upper R squaredR2. In any case, we can think of a knot as an embedding upper S Superscript 1 Baseline right arrow double struck upper R cubedS1 →R3. A knot may be
unoriented, or may have an orientation (i.e. a preferred direction around the knot),
indicated by arrowheads drawn facing tangentially along the knot.
Given multiple knots we can combine them to form links. Several knots which do
not cross at any point when projected intodouble struck upper R squaredR2 constitute a perfectly valid (if somewhat
trivial) link, but in general links involve sets of knots which cannot be projected into
a plane without some crossings. The Hopf link (the union of two unknots) is shown

(a) The Hopf link, with orientation
(b) An oriented framed
unknot, with a 2π twist
Fig.K.2 The linking of knots, and the self-linking (or “writhe”) of a framed knot are closely related.
In this case we can see that the two edges of the framed unknot b are linked through each other in
exactly the same way as the component knots of the Hopf link a
in Fig. K.2a. A similar structure can be formed by framing the unknot. As mentioned
in Sect. 7.2.3, framing a knot means we assign a non-tangential vector to every point
of the knot, and let the tips of these vectors be the points deﬁning a new knot. We then
think of the knot as being stretched out into a ribbon with the original and newly-
deﬁned knots constituting the “left” and “right” edges of this ribbon. It is entirely
possible that the framing involves twists through multiples of 2 pi2π (Fig. K.2b).
We can formalise the discussion above about distorting knots by considering the
Reidemeister moves. These are a set of three ways in which crossings in a diagram
can be changed, without cutting or rejoining the associated knot (strictly speaking
there is a zeroeth Reidemeister move, but it does not involve crossings). Any two knot
diagrams which can be transformed into each other via a sequence of Reidemester
moves correspond to knots which can be deformed into each other without breaking,
rejoining, or passing one segment of a knot through another indouble struck upper R cubedR3. We say such knots
are isotopic. The Reidemeister moves are illustrated in Fig. K.3.
We are now in a position to start discussing some invariants of knots and links.
The simplest place to start is with the linking number, script upper LL (not to be confused with a
lagrangian density, despite the choice of symbol!), equivalent to normal upper Phi left bracket lamda comma lamda prime right bracketϕ[λ, λ'] discussed
in Sect.7.2.3. As the name suggests, this just counts the number of linkings, and since
two crossings must occur whenever a pair a knotsupper K 1K1 andupper K 2K2 are linked, it is given by
half the number of crossings. To make this more precise, consider a crossing of two

Fig. K.4 Left-handed and right-handed crossings of segments of oriented knots. If one imagines
orienting one’s hands so the thumbs point upwards, when knots form a left-handed (right-handed)
crossing they wind around a vertical axis in the direction of the ﬁngers of the left (right) hand.
The sign of each crossing allows skein relations to be written for the writhe, where a diagram of a
crossing stands in for the sign of that crossing (right)
oriented knots, and distinguish between left-handed and right-handed crossings, as
per Fig. K.4. The linking number for a given link is half the number of right-handed
crossings minus half the number or left-handed crossings (or in other words, let the
sign of a left-handed crossing be -1 and the sign of a right-handed crossing be +1. The
linking number is half the sum of these values for the entire link). You can conﬁrm
for yourself that the Hopf link as drawn in Fig. K.2a has linking number –1, though
you may need to reorient the diagram to more easily determine if a given crossing
is left-handed or right-handed. Conﬁrm also that if the orientation of either of the
component knots is reversed the linking number becomes +1, and reverts to –1 if the
orientations of both knots are reversed.
An associated quantity which can be assigned to oriented framed knots is the
self-linking number or writhe, w left parenthesis upper K right parenthesisw(K). This is found by treating a framed knot as
the link composed of its “left” and “right” edges, and counting the right-handed

192
Appendix K:Knots,Links,and the Kauffman Bracket
crossings minus the number of left-handed crossings. Thus, for example, the writhe
of the framed unknot in Fig. K.2b is –2. A writhe can also be assigned to links as
well as knots. In this case the writhew left parenthesis upper L right parenthesisw(L) is the sum of the linking numbers of pairs
of knots in the link, plus the sum of the self-linking numbers of the knots,

We can consider how the writhe and linking number would change if we swapped
left-handed crossings for right-handed crossings and vice-versa. This opens up the
subject of skein relations. These are rules which tell us how a quantity like the
linking number or writhe (or other more sophisticated invariants) change when we
make modiﬁcations to a link diagram. In the simple case of the writhe, these take the
form of algebraic relationships where the diagram of a crossing behaves equivalently
to its numerical value. The skein relations can be used to ﬁnd the writhe of a framed
knot by successively undoing crossings (i.e. swapping a left-handed crossing for a
right-handed crossing and vice-versa, and retaining an additive numerical term as per
Fig. K.4), and using the Reidermeister moves (which leave the writhe unchanged)
to convert the knot into an unknot (which has a writhe of zero).
Take note that if two links (or two knots) have different linking numbers or writhes
they are not isotopic, but if they have the same linking numbers or writhes that does
not necessarily mean they are isotopic.
A vast amount can (and has) been said about knots and links which will not be
repeated here. We will simply mention another characterisation of links which is
relevant to the discussion in Sect.7.2.3, the Kauffman bracket left angle bracket upper L right angle bracket<L> of a link upper LL. This
provides an algebraic expression which is determined via a state sum much like we
would encounter in classical statistical mechanics. In this case, the sum is taken over
possible values (named upper AA and upper BB, not to be confused with the vector potential and
magnetic ﬁeld!) assigned to the crossings of a link, and dependent on a parameterdd
which is raised to the power of the number of separate closed loops the link would
form if all crossings were removed (this of course depends on exactly how each
crossing is removed). With the speciﬁc choices upper B equals upper A Superscript negative 1B = A−1 and d equals minus left parenthesis upper A squared plus upper A Superscript negative 2 Baseline right parenthesisd = −(A2 + A−2)
the Kauffman bracket is found to be invariant under the permissible deformations of
a framed link (i.e. the Reidemeister moves, with the ﬁrst move being replaced by its
framed equivalent).
The Kauffman bracket of a link is found by examining each crossing, facing
such that it resembles a right-handed crossing (Fig. K.4), but without considering
orientation. One then looks at all the ways the values upper AA and upper BB could be assigned to
these crossings (i.e. forupper NN crossings there are2 Superscript upper N2N possible assignments). If a crossing
is assigned upper AA, it is replaced by a pair of uncrossed vertical lines. If a crossing is
assignedupper BB, it is replaced by a pair of uncrossed horizontal lines. Each assignment of
upper AAs andupper BBs then produces a diagram consisting ofdd disjoint unknots. The polynomial
assigned to left angle bracket upper L right angle bracket<L> is found by adding the products of upper AAs and upper BBs for each assignment,
weighted by the relevant power ofdd in each case. This is illustrated in Fig. K.5. The
Kauffman bracket has its own particular skein relations which are also illustrated.

Quantum (or qq-Deformed) Groups
Probably the ﬁrst important thing to say about quantum groups is that they should
really have a different name. It is not immediately obvious how (if at all) one would
relate them to quantum mechanics, and, moreover they are noncommutative algebras,
rather than groups. The term “qq-deformed” is sometimes used, and gives a better
indication of the means by which these structures are established.
To keep the discussion brief we will follow [17] to present a simple example,
which illustrates the role of the deformation parameter qq. Consider 2 times 22 × 2 matrices
upper MM and epsilonϵ such that
upper M equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column alpha 2nd Column beta 2nd Row 1st Column gamma 2nd Column delta EndMatrix comma epsilon equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column 0 2nd Column q Superscript negative 1 divided by 2 Baseline 2nd Row 1st Column minus q Superscript 1 divided by 2 Baseline 2nd Column 0 EndMatrix periodM =
( α β
γ δ
)
, ϵ =

.
(L.1)
We recognise that epsilon squared equals negative double struck 1ϵ2 = −1. We will not assume that alpha comma beta comma gamma comma deltaα, β, γ, δ commute under
multiplication. If we impose the condition
upper M epsilon upper M Superscript intercalate Baseline equals upper M Superscript intercalate Baseline epsilon upper M equals epsilonMϵM = M ϵM = ϵ
(L.2)
it is a simple matter to run through expanding the matrices and ﬁnd that,
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column alpha beta equals q beta alpha 2nd Column beta delta equals q delta beta 3rd Column delta alpha minus q Superscript negative 1 Baseline gamma beta equals 1 2nd Row 1st Column gamma delta equals q delta gamma 2nd Column alpha gamma equals q gamma alpha 3rd Column alpha delta minus q gamma beta equals 1 3rd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column gamma beta equals beta gamma 3rd Column Blank EndLayoutαβ = qβα
βδ = qδβ
δα −q−1γβ = 1
γδ = qδγ
αγ = qγα
αδ −qγβ = 1
(L.3)
γβ = βγ
These are clearly different to the relationships we would expect if the components of
upper MM were simply complex numbers and hence commuted. For example, we can easily
show that
left bracket alpha comma delta right bracket equals left parenthesis q minus q Superscript negative 1 Baseline right parenthesis gamma beta period[α, δ] = (q −q−1)γβ .

Appendix L:Quantum (or q-Deformed) Groups
Notice thatalpha delta minus q gamma beta equals 1αδ −qγβ = 1 looks like the determinant ofupper MM, if it were in SL(2), except
for that factor of qq. We see that these relationships amount to a “deformation” of
the relationships we would expect, which can be recovered by settingq right arrow 1q →1. In this
context the parameterqq deﬁnes how much the quantum group is deformed from being
what we would think of as an ordinary group (hence we can take a group like U(1)
and deform it into a related quantum group) withq equals 1q = 1 resulting in no deformation.
Since doing so leads toalpha beta equals beta alphaαβ = βα etc., we see that Eqs. (L.3) are a result of choosing
q not equals 1q /= 1, and the supposition that thealpha comma beta comma gamma comma deltaα, β, γ, δ do not commute under multiplication
is secondary to the introduction of a deformation parameter. Note also that in the
discussion of BF theories with a cosmological constant in Sect.7.2.3 we saw that qq
was given by the exponential of the inverse of the Chern-Simons level,q tilde exp left parenthesis 1 divided by k right parenthesisq ∼exp(1/k).
Sincekk is inversely-proportional tonormal upper Lamda∆in such theories, we ﬁnd thatq right arrow 1q →1 asnormal upper Lamda right arrow 0∆→0.
We can further explore the idea of a deformation (and indeed, something of
the reason behind the name “quantum groups”) by considering the transition from
classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. Classical observables of a system, such
as position and momentum, deﬁne points in phase space, and we can deﬁne an
algebra of classical observables by reference to the Poisson bracket which serves
as a binary operation (Sect.A.1). The transition to quantum mechanics is achieved
by reference to operators corresponding to observables, and promoting the Poisson
brackets to commutators, as per the discussion in Sect.4.3, to obtain for example
the Heisenberg uncertainty relationleft bracket ModifyingAbove x With caret comma ModifyingAbove p With caret right bracket equals bold i italic h over two pi[ˆx, ˆp] = i . We can consider this a deformation
of the commutative algebra of classical observables into a noncommutative algebra,
with a deformation parameter italic h over two pi . When italic h over two pi right arrow 0 →0 we recover the classical world from
the quantum. In a similar vein, we may use Eqs. (L.3) to write relations such as
alpha beta minus beta alpha equals left bracket alpha comma beta right bracket equals left parenthesis q minus 1 right parenthesis beta alpha right bracket commaαβ −βα = [α, β] = (q −1)βα] ,
(L.5)
that is to say the commutatorleft bracket alpha comma beta right bracket not equals 0[α, β] /= 0 whenq not equals 1q /= 1. This is the source of the name
“quantum group”, as the commutation relationship is reminiscent of the commutation
relations between position and momentum in the Heisenberg uncertainty relation,
above.
Whileqq-deformed groups are too vast a subject to discuss in great detail here, it is
worth becoming familiar with the foundational concepts and some terminology. The
next few paragraphs provide an overview, drawn speciﬁcally from the discussions in
[18–21], to which the reader is referred for more details.
The phase space of a system is usually thought of as a kind of abstract manifold
representing the possible states the system can be in. But it can be endowed with
extra structure, such that it becomes a group. That is to say, if gg and hh are points in
the phase space upper GG, we can deﬁne a mappingupper G times upper G right arrow upper GG × G →G which obeys the closure,
identity, inverse, and associativity properties (Sect.A.1) which turns the setupper GG into a
group.
We can treat the functionsf f on elements ofupper GG (which are mappings from elements
of upper GG to some ﬁeld kk, such as the complex numbers, for instance) as elements of an

Appendix L:Quantum (or q-Deformed) Groups
197
algebra, upper AA. Then just as a group has an identity and inverse we ﬁnd that there exists
a mapping epsilon colon upper A right arrow kε : A →k deﬁned in terms of the identity,
epsilon left parenthesis f right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis e right parenthesisε( f ) = f (e)
(L.6)
referred to as the counit. That is, the counit is a mapping that acts upon the functions
f f to yield thekk-valued element thatf f would map the identity to. Similarly there is a
mappingupper SS deﬁned in terms of the inverse which mapsupper A right arrow upper AA →A, called the antipode,
such that
upper S left parenthesis f right parenthesis left parenthesis g right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis g Superscript negative 1 Baseline right parenthesis commaS( f )(g) = f (g−1) ,
(L.7)
which can be visualised as acting onf f to transpose where inkk any two pointsgg and
g Superscript negative 1g−1 are mapped to by f f . In fact, in general there is a coproduct, corresponding to
the product in upper GG, denoted by Delta∆and mapping upper A right arrow upper A circled times upper AA →A ⊗A such that
Delta left parenthesis f right parenthesis left parenthesis g comma h right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis g h right parenthesis equals f Subscript left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis g right parenthesis circled times f Subscript left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis∆( f )(g, h) = f (gh) = f(1)(g) ⊗f(2)(h)
(L.8)
(the subscripts referring to the two copies ofupper AA). If we have a mappingmm onupper AA, such
thatm colon upper A circled times upper A right arrow upper Am : A ⊗A →A, thenDelta∆maps “back the other way”. In short, given some group
we can associate an algebra to that group and construct a coalgebra, equipped with
the coproduct, counit, and antipode, corresponding to the product, unit, and inverse.
Hence if

m⊗1

we obtain a coalgebra upper CC by reversing arrows, and replacing the product with the

(L.10)
as in the ﬁgures on pages 6 and 11 of [19]. In this sense coalgebras are dual to
algebras. Notice that in Eq. (L.9) we could have replacedm circled times double struck 1m ⊗1 withdouble struck 1 circled times m1 ⊗m, and in
Eq. (L.10) we could have replaced Delta circled times double struck 1∆⊗1 with double struck 1 circled times Delta1 ⊗∆, due to the associativity of mm
and Delta∆.
One can also show thatepsilonε andDelta∆are morphisms of algebras, and along withupper SS they
satisfy coinvertibility, such that

(L.11)
where degrees◦denotes composition of mappings.
An algebra upper AA which contains a unit element, and satisﬁes these conditions is
referred to as a Hopf algebra. The name ‘quantum group’ is generally assigned to
such algebras which are not commutative, nor cocommutative.

M
Entropy
Without thinking too hard about gases, and molecules moving at different speeds,
entropy can simply be related to how much information is conveyed by learning that
a system is in a given state. This may be seen as a measure of how surprising that
state is. For instance, considering a fair coin toss, it takes one bit of information to say
whether the coin lands on heads or tails. If the coin was two-headed, there would be no
surprise associated with the fact that it landed on heads, and no information conveyed
by saying the outcome of tossing this coin was heads. If the coin had a head and a tail,
but was biased such that the probability of heads was greater than the probability
of tails, there would be more surprise associated with reporting that it landed on
tails than on heads, and more information conveyed by doing so. The fact that more
information is conveyed by reporting the less likely outcome can be understood by
analogy to asking the question “Is today a week day?” Assuming the day on which
you ask the question is chosen randomly, there is a 2/7 chance the answer is no,
and a 5/7 chance the answer is yes. The more likely answer doesn’t convey much
information, as it is not very speciﬁc and doesn’t eliminate very many options (telling
you that it’s either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday). With ﬁve
remaining options you would need more than a single bit of information to specify
exactly which day it is. But the less likely answer is more speciﬁc. You now need
only a single bit of information to work out whether it’s Saturday or Sunday, and
hence the answer “No, today is not a weekday” carries more information than the
answer “Yes, today is a weekday”.
The question about whether today is a weekday is an example of a binary search.
A range of options were split into two categories, and we asked a question which
made us focus on one of those categories. In this case the categories were unequally
sized, but in general a binary search would proceed in the following manner. Suppose
we are trying to identify a target value xx of some variable, which we know takes
values in the set StartSet x Subscript i Baseline EndSet{xi} where i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ni = 1, . . . , n. For instance, the x Subscript ixi may be the integers
i equals 1 comma ellipsis comma ni = 1, . . . , n, they may be the days of the week, they may be letters from the Latin
alphabet, etc. We ﬁrst ask whether ii is greater than n divided by 2n/2. Suppose the answer is yes.

Appendix M:Entropy
We would then ignore the values less thann divided by 2n/2, and ask whetherii is greater than3 n divided by 43n/4
(i.e. which half of the rangen divided by 2 comma ellipsis comma nn/2, . . . , n does it lie in?). We would continue like this,
dividing the range in half each time until we arrived at the value ofxx we were seeking.
At each step we ask a simple binary question—“Isxx in the top or bottom half of the
remaining range?”—and hence to specify the location ofxx we need a number of bits
equal to the number of questions we ask. How many questions do we need? We can
deduce this by working backwards. The last question should decide between two
options, that is 2 Superscript 121 options. The penultimate question should subdivide at most four
options, that is 2 squared22 options, in to equal halves. The third last question should divide
2 cubed23 options into equal halves. And so on. If the total number of questions isupper QQ, andxx
lies in the range1 comma ellipsis comma n1, . . . , n it follows thatn almost equals 2 Superscript upper Qn ≈2Q (remembering that in the real world,
nn won’t necessarily be an integer power of 2, so we can expect approximate rather
than exact equality). In other words, upper QQ, which is the number of bits of information
needed to specify xx, is of order log Subscript 2 Baseline nlog2 n. The appearance of a logarithm now seems
quite natural (pun intended, although in this case it of course not natural, but rather
to the base 2).
Consider now the case of multiple fair coin tosses, for instance tossing two coins,
each of which has a50 percent sign50% probability of landing heads (H) or tails (T)—or equivalently
tossing a single fair coin twice. The four possible outcomes are TT, TH, HT, and
HH, each with equal probability of 1 divided by 41/4. When the exact condition of each toss is
speciﬁed, we call this a microstate. If we ignore any ordering of the coins we can
then deﬁne three states, namely two-tails, one-head-one-tail, and two-heads, with
respective probabilities1 divided by 41/4,1 divided by 21/2, and1 divided by 41/4. Since the exact outcome of each toss is not
speciﬁed, we distinguish these from microstates, and call them macrostates. The one-
head-one-tail macrostate is twice as probable as either of the other two macrostates
because it contains two microstates (HT and TH), while the other macrostates contain
only a single microstate each.11
In this case we see that it takes two bits of information to deﬁne each microstate.
And hence it takes two bits of information to specify that the system is in either
the two-tails or two-heads macrostates. But the one-of-each macrostate consists of
two microstates, corresponding to a single distinguishing bit of information that we
don’t need. So only2 minus 1 equals 12 −1 = 1 bit of information is needed to specify that the system
is in this macrostate. Instead of asking two questions (“What was the result of the
ﬁrst toss?” and “What was the result of the second toss?”) we could ask “Are both
coins showing the same face?”. Half the time the answer wil be yes, and no further
questions are needed to ﬁnd the macrostate of the system. The average information
needed to specify which macrostate the system is in is the weighted mean of the
number of bits for each macrostate, thus

For a more complex example, consider the analogous situation when tossing four
coins. This time four bits are needed to specify a particular microstate, as there are
2 Superscript 4 Baseline equals 1624 = 16 microstates, TTTT, HTTT, THTT, TTHT, TTTH, HHTT, HTHT,..., HHHT,
HHHH in total. The macrostate corresponding to one head and three tails contains
four microstates. Specifying a particular microstate within this macrostate requires
two bits (which are redundant if we only want to specify the macrostate), and hence
to answer the question “Is the system in the one-head-three-tails macrostate?” only
requires 4 minus 2 equals 24 −2 = 2 bits of information. The number of redundant questions is the
logarithm (to the base 2) of the number of microstates in the macrostate of interest.
Looking at the two-coin and four-coin examples, if we denote the number of
microstates in our macrostate of interest bynormal upper Omega Subscript upper IΩI, and the total number of microstates
by n equals 2 Superscript upper Qn = 2Q as before, then the number of bits needed to specify a macrostate was
equal to
upper Q minus log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis normal upper Omega Subscript upper I Baseline right parenthesis equals log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis n right parenthesis minus log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis normal upper Omega Subscript upper I Baseline right parenthesis equals log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis StartFraction n Over normal upper Omega Subscript upper I Baseline EndFraction right parenthesis equals log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis 1 divided by p Subscript upper I Baseline right parenthesisQ −log2(ΩI) = log2(n) −log2(ΩI ) = log2
( n
ΩI
)
= log2(1/pI)
(M.2)
wherep Subscript upper IpI is the probability that the system will be in our macrostate of interest, if all
microstates occur with equal probability. As above, the average information needed
to specify which macrostate the system is in is the weighted mean of the number of
bits for each macrostate, so we ﬁnd
upper I equals sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts p Subscript i Baseline log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis 1 divided by p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis equals minus sigma summation Underscript i Endscripts p Subscript i Baseline log Subscript 2 Baseline left parenthesis p Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis periodI =

(M.3)
To keep things easy here, for pedagogical purposes, we have stuck to cases where
each probability is a power of1 divided by 21/2, and used logarithms to the base 2. Of course, we
might be tempted to look at examples where the probabilities were powers of 1 divided by 31/3
and use logarithms to the base 3, or some other choice, in which case we’re no longer
counting bits, but some other unit of information (trits in the case of logarithms to the
base 3, nats in the case of natural logarithms, etc.) but that would not fundamentally
change our result, as we can always convert between logarithms to the base 2 and
logarithms to another base using the well-known formula,
log Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals StartFraction log Subscript b Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis Over log Subscript b Baseline left parenthesis a right parenthesis EndFraction loga(x) = logb(x)
logb(a)
(M.4)
and hence convert our answer to bits. This shows us that Eq. (M.3) is just Shan-
non’s entropy formula, Eq. (8.4), if we identify the information needed to specify a
macrotate with the entropy associated to that macrostate.
The connection to thermodynamic entropy can be seen as follows. Imagine that
we have a container, divided into equal subsections labelled A, B, C, etc. The subsec-
tions are separated by impermeable partitions. Initially, there are upper NN gas molecules
contained in subsection A. At some time the partitions are removed, allowing the
gas molecules to diffuse to other subsections. If we were to ask where gas molecule
1, gas molecule 2,..., gas molecule upper NN are located at the moment the partitions are

202
Appendix M:Entropy
removed we will get the entirely straightforward answer AAAAAAAA... (a string of
As, of lengthupper NN). The container is, in essence, a machine that produces a completely
predictable string of symbols from the list A, B, C,...
A short while later, some of the molecules will have diffused to the other subsec-
tions, but most will still remain in subsection A. If we were to ask the locations of
the gas molecules now we might get a string like AAABAACA... The container has
become a machine which produces a fairly predictable string of symbols. That is,
given each symbol in the string, we have a good (but not perfect) chance of predicting
the next symbol, since we know that it will most likely be an A.
Eventually the gas molecules will diffuse until they are equally (or very nearly so)
distributed among the subsections of the container. Now we would obtain a string like
EABBFCEDF... The container is now a kind of machine that produces an entirely
random answer, in which the probability of each symbol is equal and independent
of the symbols that came before it.
The crucial point is that each gas molecule is like a coin (or a coin toss) in our
examples above. And the subsections we may ﬁnd the molecules in are like the
outcomes—heads or tails—of a coin toss. Each string of symbols corresponds to
a microstate of the gas molecules in the container, just as a string of symbols like
HTTH corresponded to a microstate of coin tosses. There is only one way to create
a microstate in which all the molecules are in subsection A. But there are multiple
ways (microstates) to have the molecules distributed between several subsections.
The number of microstates corresponding to the molecules being equally distributed
is larger than for any other situation. For instance, with three subsections A, B, C,
and three molecules the possibilities are;
0 Cs
1 C
2 Cs
3 Cs
0 Bs
AAA
CAA, ACA, AAC
CCA, CAC, ACC
CCC
1 B
BAA, ABA, AAB
ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA
CCB, CBC, BCC
2 Bs
BBA, BAB, ABB
BBC, BCB, CBB
3 Bs
BBB
Hence if each microstate is equally likely we would expect the system to more
often be in microstates corresponding to the molecules being distributed between
multiple subsections, rather than all concentrated into one subsection, since there
are more of the former microstates than the latter. The probability of any given
macrostate is proportional to the number of microstates it contains. In this exam-
ple, the macrostate consisting of all three molecules being in different subsections
contains six microstates, and hence it is twice as likely as the macrostate with two
molecules in A and one molecule in B, etc. As the number of molecules goes up,
the probabilities of macrostates in which the molecules are fairly evenly distributed
rapidly outstrips the probabilities of macrostates where they are unevenly distributed.
It should now be clear to see that the evolution from an uneven distribution of gas
molecules to an even distribution may be thought of as the container of gas evolving
from being a machine that outputs a low-entropy, predictable, unsurprising, string of
characters, such as AAAAA... (we’ll call such a machine a low-entropy macrostate)
to being a machine that outputs a high-entropy, unpredictable, surprising string of

Appendix M:Entropy
203
characters (and we’ll call such a machine a high-entropy macrostate). Furthermore,
this evolution is a probabilistic process, determined by the fact that the system is more
likely to be in a macrostate which contains many microstates rather than one which
contains few microstates. As this process is probabilistic, we expect it to apply to
numerous other physical systems besides containers of gas—including the complex,
ﬂuctuating networks of spins that describe spacetime in loop quantum gravity.
