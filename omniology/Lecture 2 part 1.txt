What is the neural code?
-- the biophysical basis of how the brain processes inputs and 
performs complex computations (week 5)
-- techniques for recording from the brain 
-- tools for discovering how the brain represents information
-- some methods for inferring what the brain is doing based on its 
activity (week 3)
-- models that express our understanding of this representation
-- using information theory to quantify neural representations (week 4)

Decoding: what do these responses tell us about the stimulus?
•
how can we reconstruct what the brain is doing?
Encoding and decoding
Encoding: how does a stimulus cause a pattern of responses?
•
building quasi-mechanistic models
P(response | stimulus)
P(stimulus | response)
encoding
decoding
What is the response? What is the stimulus?
What is the relationship between them?
