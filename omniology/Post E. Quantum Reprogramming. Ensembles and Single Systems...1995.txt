Preface
The vein of discussion in this book may be said to be predicated by one 
overriding major conclusion. It is the conviction that progress in work on 
quantum fundamentals cannot be forthcoming as long as the Schroedinger 
equation is taken to be equally applicable to single systems as to ensembles. 
The removal of this mostly "silent" dichotomy pervading quantum 
interpretation is a principal objective of this collection of essays.
These essays, therefore, aim at changing the prevailing nonclassical 
epistemology of quantum uncertainty. This major modification in 
perceptual philosophy opens up the single-system microphysical domain to 
a renewed spacetime topological scrutiny. By the same token, it properly 
reserves standard methods to randomized ensembles, 'rhe new situation of a 
topology-based single-system approach, with standard quantum machinery 
restricted to ensembles, calls for a two-tier theory of quanta.
The cited topological pursuit directly addresses single system spacetime 
physical configurations and is therefore radically different from existing 
explorations that have emerged in the realm of Hilbert's spectral spaces. 
QED, QCD, Gauge theories, Lie algebras, S-matrix, Regge poles, grand 
unifications, and super-string theories of "everything" belong in this 
"Hilbert" category. The present endeavor of treating single systems is 
much less ambitious; it operates in spacetime itself.
To initiate the necessary steps of paving the way for a two-tier 
alternative, it was thought to initiate this venture with essays aiming at 
loosening the iron grip of existing rules and paradigms of quantum 
mechanics. The conceptual intertwining of needed changes and their effect 
on existing metaphors made a step-by-step procedure mandatory. Yet 
individual essay publication became very cumbersome, because each essay 
had to reiterate radical changes in premises made in earlier essays. All of 
this evoked too much controversy to come to a workable publication 
process. Manuscripts either met with unmanageable reviewer responses or 
outright rejection. If this quantum reprogramming message deserves to 
come across at all, a suitably indexed essay collection with cross-references 
seemed the way to go; in fact, it turned out to be the only way available.

PREFACE
A repetition of exposure to conceptual predicaments is apparent in this 
collection. Yet, in retrospect, a measure of repetition is seen as necessary to 
loosen hardened convictions. For subject matter in a state of flux, a reduc­
tion in size by combing out those redundancies seemed premature.
If reading these chapters generates uneasiness, it may be well to 
consider an unusual quote, which has been ascribed to Max Planck:
"New scientific truth does not triumph by convincing 
opponents, but rather because opposition dies and a new 
generation grows up familiar with it."
Note how Planck is reluctant to credit the new generation with 
conviction through reason. He cautiously stops at familiarity, which is 
necessary, but not sufficient for reason. Following Planck's counsel, we 
now need to explore more this no man's land between familiarity and 
understanding.

Apology and Acknowledgment
None of the criticism in these chapters directed at the "Copenhageners" 
should be regarded as reflecting adversely on the city of Copenhagen or its 
good citizens. On the contrary, physics owes an unusual debt of gratitude 
to Copenhagen, because some of the seeds from which this criticism 
emerged also first originated in the great city of Copenhagen.
I also owe a debt of gratitude to those who read earlier versions of this 
monograph. Their mixed feelings, criticism, or the conspicuous absence 
thereof somehow helped in making the presentation more articulate.
I have gratefully accepted a suggestion by S C Tiwari to reorganize the 
material in major subdivisions. They are: (l)The Copenhagen Era, (2)The 
Sommerfeld-de Rham view of Single Systems, (3)Cohomological Synthesis, 
and (4)Ramifications of the Two-Tier View of Quantum Mechanics. 
Computer technology made it easy to accomplish this reordering.
I thank Harry Newton for reading most of the earlier manuscript, which 
resulted in useful advice about language. Michael Berg combed the text for 
infelicities; those remaining testify to the number that needed to be 
processed. He suggested lifting out the quote pertaining to formalisms 
leading man instead of man taking charge of the formalisms. I also ac­
knowledge with pleasure a crucial contribution by Christine Brunak. She 
challenged (sometimes to her dismay) this unaccomplished typist to become 
a reasonably accomplished word processor. Tom Boyce extended generous 
help with some of the more tricky word processing operations and Ruth 
Jackson gave the manuscript a still very necessary final combing on 
grammar, syntax and punctuation.
When this book went to press, word came that the mathematician 
Nicolaas Hendrik Kuiper had passed away. A long time ago, when I 
decided (at a somewhat later age) to take up physics, Nico always extended 
unconditional counsel. He first alerted me to the significance of the 
distinctions between local and global methods in mathematics. This book 
became in many ways an attempt at transferring those local-global 
distinctions to the realm of physics. If these efforts have any virtue at all, it 
was Nico who gave it an early impetus.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
1. An Interface of Human Experiences
Man's earliest signs of interaction with Nature in a consciously con­
structive manner may well have coincided with the dawn of agriculture. It 
signalled the beginning of an era of partial control of nature, which then, 
by the same token, would also generate a more acute awareness as to what 
aspects of nature remained beyond the realm of human influence.
The first discoveries of Nature's rules and laws for the regeneration of 
the species gave man more of a distinct opportunity for guiding his own 
destiny through a control of the food supply; provided, of course, he 
learned to live according to those rules dictated by this newly acquired 
knowledge. The ensuing agricultural society therefore required a more 
delicately balanced social organization. This balance could not be well ac­
complished unless the members of this new society were willing to enter 
into a new phase of enhanced mutual responsibility.
In addition to learning the practical rules for conducting a successful 
agriculture, man had to accept a new form of inner discipline to maintain 
this new society. The more vulnerable structure of this new society was in 
fact more prone to disturbances by undisciplined characters.
The just depicted portrayal of an emerging agricultural society con­
fronted man with a disciplined study of two sets of rules. They were: first, 
the technical rules necessary to conduct this new practice of farming, and 
second: rules dealing with the aspects of a new code of mutual behavior. 
They were rules of ethics and morality, necessary to protect and consoli­
date the organization of this early new form of agricultural society.
Contemporary society still reflects this two-sided aspect of development. 
The founding fathers of the United States of America saw to it that the 
Agricultural & Mechanical engineering schools provided the knowledge 
and training in science and technology to help feed this nation, whereas law 
and theology colleges were to provide the magistrates and preachers who 
would help make this a society of law-abiding citizens, whose words could 
be trusted, and whose deeds could be counted upon as contributions 
supportive of the common good. These two types of schools deal with a 
vastly different subject matter.

CHAPTER I
The schools of science and technology pride themselves in maintaining a 
strong logical thread in their teachings. The rules they promulgate relate 
and can be reduced to basic natural phenomena. The scientific method is 
distinguished by its systematics based on strict logic, as applied to the laws 
of nature.
By contrast, the schools of law and theology deal with rules of human 
behavior. They cannot, to the same extent as in science, be logically re­
duced to a common denominator. Rules of human behavior may be estab­
lished by the simple fact or expectation that following those rules makes 
for a "kinder and friendlier," and more smoothly functioning society. The 
schools of law occupy themselves with the practical everyday aspects of 
such human behavior, whereas schools of theology occupy themselves with 
the more esoteric aspects of humanity.
Having made this preliminary subdivision between disciplines based on 
the strict systematics of science versus those calling more on faith, let us as­
sess the viability of that subdivision. To implement a reprogramming of 
quantum mechanics, it is a major concern whether science strictly follows 
the rules of the scientific method. Does science sometimes call on the more 
esoteric qualities of faith and intuition?
This question can best be answered by noting that science would be in 
very bad shape without faith and intuition. The method of science is a 
hypothetico-deductive process. It starts out with an intuitive act of faith, by 
virtue of its making hypotheses that are either found to be valid or invalid. 
If found to be invalid the courage of conviction requires rejecting a false 
hypothesis. If found to be valid, on the other hand, the realm of validity of 
this new hypothesis need careful exploration in order to arrive at a precise 
statement that includes its limitations.
Not all hypothetico-deductive processes are, however, as black and 
white as here depicted. Some hypotheses have been found useful, yet their 
realm of validity has never been established; or, so far, the efforts of doing 
so have been either incomplete or unsuccessful. Under those circumstances 
science finds itself in a situation similar to that encountered in theology. 
One works and keeps working with those principles, because they have 
been known to be effective.
Finding a deductive chain between some isolated and previously discon­
nected hypotheses can be a major event in physics. Such experiences have 
been known to lead to a state of euphoria in which the differences between 
article of truth and article of faith can become clouded. This collection of 
essays constitutes an attempt at identifying areas in modem physics where 
the distinction between truth and faith has become unclear.
Quantum mechanics is a major domain of activity for which it has be­
come common place to operate with unproven premises. Its principal un­
proven premise rules that the Schroedinger equation may be taken to

describe a single isolated quantum mechanical system. It is interesting to 
note how few textbooks are, or have been, very explicit about this premise. 
The single-system applicability is largely taken as a foregone conclusion. 
Yet in view of the basic significance of this hypothesis, a more incisive in­
quiry is called for into the conceivable consequences of jumping to such a 
conclusion. In the course of these discussions, we shall find how one ques­
tionable premise leads to an array of interdependent questionable premises, 
all of which carry the same defective gene.
Through the years, a quantum mechanical lifestyle has been adopted that 
has taught us a series of highly ingenious concepts, enabling us to cope, as 
best we can, with these genetic inadequacies. Yet, unlike the genes we are 
dealt by birth, which cannot be changed, the genes of contemporary quan­
tum mechanics can be changed and are susceptible to repair. To do so, 
however, we have to identify and unlearn questionable teachings of the 
past.
It is well known how difficult it is to unlearn things we have learned to 
accept during our early years of indoctrination. It is also known to be 
harder to unlearn things we have learned exclusively on the basis of faith, 
than to unlearn things that can be logically identified as "mistaken." In this 
process of reexamination, we become aware how contemporary quantum 
mechanics has rather liberally called on faith. Early success was the 
tempter, which prompted such development, even when a more unbiased 
path of deduction still seemed to be available and possible.
2. Modern Physics' Logic Demerits
Logical inadequacies in science are much more common than many sci­
entists are willing to acknowledge. They become part and parcel of pro­
ceedings whenever the success of a method under consideration has ex­
ceeded the quality of understanding that has been gained. It usually means 
the method in question came into being through an element of serendipity, 
rather than through a complete process of careful logical deduction, which 
could have dictated an interpretation from the start.
Quantum mechanics, as we know it today, may be taken as a prime ex­
ample of the just-depicted state of affairs. Its fundamental tools, e.g. the 
Schroedinger equation, saw the light of day as a result of inspired theoreti­
cal experimentation, which then, in retrospect, yielded results well beyond 
expectations and without the benefit of a relevant interpretation.
It took the better part of a decade before an interpretation could be 
agreed upon by some sort of a majority consensus. The thus ensuing 
Copenhagen interpretation emerged as the most widely-accepted method of 
"rationalizing" the inner workings of the new quantum machinery. Yet the 
method of rationalizing deviated markedly from what had been customary 
in scientific reasoning until that day. The change in procedure became a 

4
CHAPTER I
landmark in physics' methodology. It inaugurated a transition between old 
and new ways of doing things. It is presently known as the transition from 
classical to nonclassical physics.
The problem here confronted can best be summarized by the question: 
How rational was the Copenhagen process of rationalization? There were 
several telltale signs revealing how the authors of the Copenhagen revolu­
tion were well aware of the drastic changes in their logic processing. It 
was during that time that voices were heard to augment existing logic with 
something referred to as quantum logic. So what is quantum logic? Is it a 
valid extension of the logic systems that were known at the time, or should 
it be identified as a compromise use of existing rules of logic? All of which 
generates the question: what is a compromise use of logic?
Since logic is defined as a system of valid reasoning for making correct 
inferences, the methods of logic have the virtue of a self-healing quality. If 
the use of logic leads to contradictions, the implication is that something 
could be wrong with the premises that started the chain of logic. This 
methodology is the very basis of mathematics' famous reductio ad absur- 
dum.
Since the protagonists of the great quantum revolution were all well 
trained and extremely competent individuals, the chances that they might 
have been making simple reasoning errors must be taken as small indeed. 
Hence the eventful transition from classical to nonclassical physics could 
hardly have been the result of a simple reasoning error. Further inquiry is 
needed as to whether the decisions instrumental in creating nonclassical 
physics were sufficiently compelling to risk an inadvertent suspension of 
logic's self-healing quality.
The logic crisis alluded to here occurred when Schroedinger's equation 
descended from heaven as a relevant and useful instrument of physics. 
Physics was confronted with two major options for its interpretation. They 
were the single system versus the ensemble view. While there was not the 
slightest doubt that the Schroedinger equation gave relevant information 
about atomic systems, no decisive answer seemed to be forthcoming as to 
whether the equation described a single atomic system or an ensemble 
thereof: i.e. a collective of similarly prepared identical atomic systems.
In the euphoria of the moment the world of physics was not prepared to 
lose itself in nitpicking about a presumed minor distinction between en­
sembles and single systems. While the Copenhageners opted for the single 
system, those holding out for the ensemble were calling out in the desert, 
abandoned by the main stream of physics. The rather subtle distinctions 
between ensemble and single system behavior were lost in the ensuing wild 
scramble for results; they remained hidden for the longest time. As a re­
sult, the ensemble character was never properly delineated, notwithstanding 
the irony of Max Planck himself anticipating a major solution feature of

that enigmatic Schroedinger equation, before the latter had even been 
discovered.
Even if contemporary quantum mechanics takes credit for adequately 
manipulating logic deductions, the basis of premises from which these de­
ductions were operating was wanting. Inadequate effort went into the jus­
tification of the choice of the single system as the primary object of de­
scription for the Schroedinger equation. In fact there was no justification 
whatsoever for that decision. It was a premature "jump in the dark," ac­
commodating, at best, some preconceived notions.
No explicit distinction between ensemble versus single system surfaced 
in the early days of trying to better understand the Schroedinger equation. 
The ensemble alternative was half tolerated as a conceivable object of de­
scription. Yet, also the ensemble did not receive a hard unambiguous 
justification A presumed closeness of ensemble and constituent single­
system responses provided the rationale for accepting this split-personality 
approach. The ensemble versus single-system asymptotics seemed to make a 
further pursuit of their distinction a trivial matter. The initial success of 
the new quantum mechanics thus tempted the Copenhageners to forego a 
more incisive examination of physical foundations.
The initial inadequacy of practically identifying ensemble and single 
system became responsible for a string of nonclassical metaphors. The sta­
tistical implications of Schroedinger's equation treating particles as point 
objects would have merely been an act comparable to an assumption in­
strumental for Maxwell-Boltzmann gas dynamics. Yet the unwarranted 
Copenhagen-inspired reduction from a many molecules gas to a particle in 
a single atomic system literally bereaved the Schroedinger-implied statistics 
from its universe of discourse. This highly nonclassical deed unavoidably 
engendered many nonclassical contingencies. It is the very deed that 
prompted Einstein (no statistics slough) to take issue with his frequently 
quoted response: "God does not play dice." There will be ample opportu­
nity to return to this pronouncement later. Compare chapter XVII; 9.
3. The Myth of the Nonclassical Metaphor
There have been more seminars and conferences on the foundations of 
quantum mechanics than on any other theory in physics. Unlike Maxwell 
theory, which almost from the start related to first principles, the quantum 
mechanics of 1925 came to us as a nearly finished product, albeit with an 
obscured relation to first principles. Quantum mechanics' amazing appli­
cability made physicists accept a seemingly finished structure, knowing 
that its foundations had not as yet been solidly anchored.
Foundations research for quantum mechanics came much more after the 
facts than for most other theories. The question arises as to what made it 
so unique that physics was willing to accept such an unusual situation.

6
CHAPTER I
Apart from the amazing applicability, there was the equally amazing 
equivalence of the double origin of this new discipline in the forms of 
matrix- and wave mechanics. Add to this the pure magic of the Dirac spin 
theory, and the stage was set for accepting quantum mechanics as a true gift 
from heaven. It is this aura of being a gift from heaven that has strongly 
dominated foundation work in subsequent years.
There is a natural inclination to expect wondrous results from a gift 
from heaven, and, in fact, there was plenty of reason to be grateful for 
what could be done with this new tool. Lowering such expectations would 
be ungrateful and disrespectful to Mother Nature. By the same token, 
tinkering with a gift from heaven to improve its performance was frowned 
upon; the theory's record of achievement gave it divine lineage.
Cursory inspection of the programs and contributions to foundations 
seminars and conferences reveals a general trend of not restricting the 
realm of applicability and of keeping the general structure intact. The ra­
tionale behind this trend is that gifts from heaven should be expected to be 
perfect or nearly perfect, with an optimum realm of applicability.
Seminars and conferences, therefore, show an almost exclusive trend of 
fitting foundations to a preexisting structure that has been very successful 
by manifesting optimum applicability. The more than sixty years of trying 
to understand the success of this status quo has met with conceptual hurdles 
that have been a vexation to the spirit. Mindful that understanding and 
status quo are as incompatible as "having one’s cake and eating it too," 
concessions must be expected, either by changing the theory structure or by 
delineating more precisely its relevance.
Since changing the structure of a good working formalism would not be 
wise, the remaining choice is a closer examination of its scope of applica­
bility. A conceivable consequence of that program is the creation of a new 
realm of physics, not treatable by the standard tools of quantum mechanics 
as we presently know them. Yet prior to launching into a new endeavor, a 
profile is needed of the standard tools of quantum mechanics, their custom­
ary interpretations and the physical territories presumed to be covered by 
those tools.
The standard tools at center stage are the Schroedinger equation and 
its conceptual associate, the Copenhagen interpretation of the solutions of 
that equation. This equation had already acquired a major track record of 
applicability prior to the development of an explicit interpretation that had 
the approval of a majority of the physics community. At this point, one 
obviously wonders how an equation could be useful without an as-yet-pre- 
cise knowledge of the physical meaning of its solutions. An important 
mathematical technicality holds a key to that enigma. A discrete set of char­
acteristic numbers of the solution, known as its eigenvalues, takes the cen­
tral position for the content of physical information being conveyed. The 

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

solution itself occupies a secondary place and retains a measure of avail­
ability for purposes of interpretation. A growing consensus subsequently 
converged on the idea that the "wave" function solutions of this equation 
had undeniably statistical implications.
Once this statistical connotation of its solutions had been established, 
opinions started to differ as to the nature of that statistics. What was it that 
could possibly be subject to a statistics in the microphysical domain? One of 
the ensuing options, which became known as the Copenhagen interpreta­
tion, was predicated by the presumed existence of an all-pervasive, a pri­
ori quantum uncertainty affecting all physical objects. This uncertainty was 
found to be compatible with the Schroedinger equation by virtue of the fact 
that it was derivable from that same equation. This concept of universal 
uncertainty had been earlier suggested by Heisenberg on the basis of a 
thought experiment of observation in which this uncertainty relates to the 
observation of isolated single systems. The knowledge about single-system 
behavior, presumed to be accessible by man, was thus taken to be limited 
by an observation-based statistics.
Yet this statistics, spawned by Schroedinger's equation, left undecided 
an issue whether this equation described a single system or an ensemble 
thereof. Even if experiments at the time indicated ensembles of identical 
systems as sources of observation, the Copenhageners, this evidence 
notwithstanding, still opted for the single-system, which they believed to be 
permissible choice. Heisenberg's thought experiment was taken to be 
supportive of that decision.
In so doing, the Copenhageners literally sacrificed a classical option for 
their statistics, because the single-system object lacked what statisticians call 
a universe of discourse. Those who did not approve of this extrapolation 
from ensemble to single system remained outside this realm of Copenhagen 
physics and later became identified as supporters of a statistical ensemble 
interpretation. Retaining the ensemble, they retained more of an option of 
finding a universe of discourse for the statistics implied by the 
Schroedinger equation. Unfortunately, the ensemble supporters fell short 
of explicitly identifying a set of parameters that could serve as a universe 
of discourse. Also, their statistics retained an aura of mystery.
Copenhagen thus took the fateful step of declaring the statistics, pertain­
ing to their chosen option of single-system, to be nonclassical in nature. 
This language stressed the absence of a universe of discourse as an irrevo­
cable inherent feature, which distinguished this new statistics from the 
classical ones that had an identifiable universe of discourse. This ominous 
initiative created what was believed to be a seemingly unavoidable dis­
tinction between classical and nonclassical physics. The introduction of 
nonclassical physics thus became a contingency of a universe of discourse 
that had not been identified.

CHAPTER I
The word nonclassical now became a receptacle for all those situations 
that did not fit the old mold, now referred to as "the world of classical 
physics," i.e. the methods and concepts that had rendered services prior to 
1925. The Copenhagen School transformed the nonclassical absence of a 
universe of discourse into a thesis claiming all human knowledge of micro­
physical situations to be fundamentally limited by an all-pervading and un­
avoidable universal statistical uncertainty.
Soon the notion of a nonclassical realm led to situations where certain 
questions could not be asked, because in the new nonclassical context such 
questions could not be accepted as meaningful. Young practitioners of the 
new discipline were admonished not to reveal a lack of knowledge by ask­
ing wrong questions. The word nonclassical acquired a status comparable 
to the fifth amendment of the U.S. constitution. This nonclassical interpre­
tation of the theory became known as the Copenhagen interpretation. It li­
censed the refusal of answering questions that could incriminate the foun­
dational soundness of this new nonclassical physics.
This liberal appeal to nonclassical notions gave the potential escape of a 
partial suspension of reasoning in situations that were deemed to be in the 
nonclassical realm. Physics underwent a process of formalization into ab­
stract schemes of organizing observations. The abstractness was in part a 
consequence of a partial and possibly premature rejection of interconnec­
tions, which conceivably could still exist from a classical angle. For all 
practical purposes, such interconnections had all been washed out by an all­
pervading nonclassical quantum uncertainty.
The use of an evasive modus operandi has been common in many realms 
of human endeavor other than physics, although recourse to such methods 
has been rare in the sciences. Assuming it is not given to man to know and 
understand everything, there is, at times, no alternative. Man takes re­
course to conjectures. Faced with the deeper questions of life, religion 
frequently has taken recourse to conjectures that could not be defended as 
samples of self-evident truth. Such conjectures, though, were believed to 
serve a practical purpose.
It now stands to reason how the presumed absence of a universe of dis­
course in quantum mechanics led to a chain of nonclassical inferences that 
have become part and parcel of physical thinking since the early Thirties. 
The attitudes outlined by this school of thinking is now collectively known 
as the Copenhagen School of interpretation(s). Since it is characteristic of 
this school of thought to leave certain specifics in the realm of the unknow­
able, a measure of interpretational plurality is to be accepted as natural 
within the Copenhagen School.
Instrumental in these nonclassical developments has been the absence of 
an explicit and complete derivation from first principles of the 
Schroedinger equation. This equation had come to physics as a gift from 

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
9
heaven. It therefore seemed unavoidable and even fitting to give its inter­
pretation a commensurate religious dogmatic flavor. Not only the Greeks 
could not be trusted when they came with presents; also heaven was under 
suspicion. More than anybody else, Schroedinger knew the shortcomings of 
his equation. It was not he, but his colleagues, who placed his equation on 
the pedestal as a gift from heaven. Man, not heaven, is to blame for draw­
ing unsubstantiated conclusions that lead to marginal decisions.
What was the major, yet least discussed, "leap of faith" that was hidden 
in what we now know as the Copenhagen interpretation? It is the view that 
holds the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics to be an instru­
ment describing a physical reality that is identifiable as a single-system. 
Quite amazingly, an inspection of the textbook literature reveals little or no 
justification to substantiate this presumed relation to reality. Starting with 
Heisenberg, continuing with Schroedinger and Dirac, and the bulk of the 
textbook literature following suit, the single-system idea became a foregone 
conclusion as if literally implied by reality. The overriding suggestion 
emanating from this rather universally adopted extrapolation may be suc­
cinctly summarized by the rhetorical question: what else could it have 
been?
The truth is, however, that through this tacit act of extrapolation, 
physics brainwashed itself and its students into believing that there were no 
worthwhile alternatives to the single system option. Having descended 
upon us with this aura of a gift from heaven, the Schroedinger equation 
had not quite met with that same intense scrutiny encountered by other 
theories, which could not boast of such heavenly kinship.
Another compounding circumstance was the mathematics of the 
Schroedinger process. It was found to be a chapter in the celebrated spec­
tral theory of Hilbert spaces. This aura of being a gift from heaven in 
conjunction with the perfection of its mathematical structure were now 
major factors permitting the Copenhagen interpretation to ride in on the 
coattails of Hilbert's near-perfect spectral theory.
The nonclassical modus operand! now developed into a veritable art. 
Similarly as artists, pioneering new developments, can't wait for the critics 
to tell them why they do what they do, proponents of the Copenhagen 
School could not wait for a majority to give them their stamp of approval. 
Those unresponsive to this new "art form" were painted into a comer of 
those who failed to recognize limitations of classical procedures. 
Copenhagen's dichotomy of classical versus nonclassical soon conquered 
the world of physics by a process of sheer intimidation. The situation set­
tled into a status quo, which has now prevailed for sixty years. There have 
been new "derivation" alternatives of the Schroedinger equation. Tran­
scriptions from Hamilton-Jacobi particle dynamics have been comple­
mented with transcriptions from diffusion theory and the Euler equations 

10
CHAPTER I
of continuum mechanics. Yet its status as gift from heaven remained 
undented.
The here-cited potential weakness in the existing relation between 
Schroedinger process and Copenhagen single-system view, imposes an obli­
gation for reexamining conceivable alternatives of interpretation. It is now 
useful to recall how early ensemble initiatives were prematurely aban­
doned, because, at the time of their introduction, they were not, or could 
not be, specified with adequate statistical detail. Since contemporary foun­
dations research still hammers away mostly at interpretations accepting the 
single-system thesis, a reexamination of those historical alternatives is now 
called for.
In the mid-Thirties, Popperl supported by Einstein^ did suggest an en­
semble alternative. At the time, the Copenhagen view was already so 
firmly entrenched that the chances for considering Popper's alternative 
were very small. The chances for accepting such an alternative were even 
smaller. In recent times, though, the growing importance of macroscopic 
quantum phenomena has made quantum mechanics a more tangible disci­
pline. Questions that could not be answered in the past can now be resub­
mitted and answered on the basis of freshly accumulating evidence.
In macroscopic quantum phenomena, it is the overriding suggestion of 
total order which specifically justifies questions concerning the where­
abouts of this so-called "all-pervasive nonclassical quantum mechanical 
statistics." If there really is such a nonclassical statistics, why does it not 
manifest itself clearly and unambiguously in these macroscopic quantum 
phenomena?
The emerging picture of a Schroedinger equation that might be 
restricted to ensembles makes the nature of the statistics to be associated 
with those ensembles a point of major concern. The early ensemble-based 
work did not quite proceed to the point of unambiguously establishing pa­
rameters of this missing universe of discourse. This failing or rather 
omission on the part of the ensemble proponents is the main reason why 
Copenhagen's nonclassical notions could rule supreme for so long.
As long as it was not necessary to make commitments about the universe 
of discourse, one could leave things as they were and had been for the last 
sixty years. It is the persistent emergence of more macroscopic quantum 
phenomena which now forces a renewed and more total confrontation 
between Copenhagen- and ensemble interpretations. This confrontation 
identifies universal uncertainty for single systems as an impermissible 
extrapolation. Uncertainty stands reduced to a status of ensemble disorder.
How is this very incisive change in current views going to be imple­
mented in the general framework of physics? It is first necessary to estab­
lish the statistical parameters of what could be tentatively referred to as a 
Schroedinger ensemble. This is done by showing that an averaging with 

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
11
the help of these newly found statistical parameters of the ensemble will 
lead to typical Schroedinger results (chapter III;5). This step complements 
the austere Popper-Einstein ensemble proposition with hard facts.
In summary, the situation is now as follows: an ensemble interpretation 
of quantum mechanics leaves Schroedinger's mathematical formulation 
largely intact. Early ensemble-based book publications by Blokhintsev,3 
Kemble^ and others testify to this effect. These texts read much like the 
Copenhagen-oriented texts. The additional detail injected in these essays 
indicates how the Schroedinger eigenvalue process characteristically applies 
to unordered ensembles. The thus ensuing Schroedinger ensemble is found 
to be randomized in phase and orientation.
It is relevant to note that the prevailing Copenhagen interpretation of 
quantum mechanics, true to its noncommittal views, also permits, in prin­
ciple, the mental construction of a so-called Gibbs-type ensemble of con­
ceivable single-system manifestations. The conceptual plurality of the 
Gibbs picture of a single-system view, though, is no substitute for an actual 
physical plurality with interactions between constituent parts.
The restriction of the Schroedinger equation to appropriately random­
ized ensembles leaves ordered ensembles and single systems without a suit­
able tool of inquiry. New instruments of inquiry need to be identified to 
fill the gap created by restricting the realm of applicability of the 
Schroedinger equation. Chapters VI and VIII explore the existence and 
mathematical nature of such tools. The ensuing subject of period integrals 
is by no means new to physics. Yet, in the perspective of new physical 
developments pertaining to the mathematical concepts of local-global, the 
physics of single systems can now be approached in an encompassing and 
more appropriate global way.
The local-global aspect is also reflected in the very definition of the 
concept of ensemble: an ensemble is a thing known through its elements. 
The dictionary definition of the word ensemble, in fact, says exactly that. 
A measure of randomness then serves well in making identical elements 
recognizable as distinct from one another by giving each its very own 
phase and orientation.
The elements of a wholly ordered ensemble, by contrast, lack this mea­
sure of distinguishability as independent entities. Hence, the wholly ordered 
ensemble is, for all practical purposes, a single system; while the elements 
are parts of the whole, they don't have phase and orientation individuality 
as criteria for distinguishing one from the other.
It is now not altogether unreasonable to suspect that an all-global 
description (say without an equivalent local counterpart) is needed for tack­
ling the single system or the wholly ordered ensemble. Since there is, by 
definition, in the wholly ordered ensemble no change when proceeding 

12
CHAPTER I
from one element to the other, a differential equation process is less suit­
able for conveying information. The Schroedinger approach is then out, 
and an all-global approach takes over.
Mathematically, it means that an integral takes the place of the 
differential equation plus boundary conditions. This integral, though, can­
not be of the reflexive type as used in a Hilbert integral equation. The latter 
typically reflects an ensemble situation, because the local function relates to 
itself by domain integration of its values elsewhere (chapters VI; 8, 
XVII;7). Such integral equations are equivalent to a differential equation 
with boundary conditions. An ab initio integral formulation, by contrast, 
has an intrinsic global feature. Period integrals offer a perspective for 
such ab initio global descriptions.
Period integrals have always played a basic role in the development of 
physics. In these chapters, they are placed on a new level of enhanced 
physical awareness. Mathematical developments due to de Rham have made 
period integration a major tool for exploring topological structure. 
Interestingly, electromagnetic field configurations served de Rham as a 
source of inspiration in developing his cohomology of configurations in 
abstract mathematical manifolds.
Among the new global quantum tools under consideration as period in­
tegrals, some relate to the history of this subject (chapter VI), others aim at 
new topological perspectives (chapter XIII). The result is a quantum 
cohomology of physical configurations. Since a quantum cohomology 
indicates a global approach to the laws of nature, one may wonder: how 
can a global tool with presumed macro-connotation guide in the 
predominantly micro-domain of quanta? Consider here that Copenhagen's 
all-pervasive quantum uncertainty has, in the past, tended to preclude ap­
plicability of macro procedures in the micro-domain. How can further in­
sight be gained in this macro-micro applicability of global tools?
As topological probes, period integrals can be expected to be pre-metric 
(i.e. metric-independent). The idea of physical laws having metric-indepen­
dent connotations, while unnatural at first, now becomes a matter of fun­
damental physical importance. Indeed, the counting of quantum states 
should not be contingent on metric use. Since only the metric field makes 
micro/macro distinctions, laws manifesting metric-independence can have 
equal applicability in micro- and macrodomains. The counting laws of 
quantum states belong in that category.
It has been a well-hidden secret that a metric-independent branch of 
physics has been around for some time. The names of reputable mathe­
maticians and physicists have been associated with that endeavor. It took 
place three-quarters of a century ago. In his account of these matters, 
Whittaker^ later remarked: "It must be said, however, that, elegant though 
the mathematical developments have been, their relevance to fundamental 

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
13
physical theory must for the present be regarded as hypothetical." A few 
pages later he continues, almost answering his own query: "It is character­
istic of theories such as this that differential relations are generally re­
placed by integral relations."
Whittaker's words acquire prophetic significance in the light of the 
local-* global transition initiated by de Rham's use of period integration. 
The macro/micro contrast as criterion of physical applicability cannot now 
be a fundamental issue, because the metric is the one and only means to tell 
the macro/micro difference. Since counting absolute quanta of nature 
should not depend on subjective choices of reference frame or metric, a 
metric-independent status of certain laws of nature should now no longer 
remain an unexplained mystery.
While these introductory remarks identify and logically justify some of 
the principal conceptual ingredients used in the following chapters, a 
hands-on experience is necessary to substantiate their relevance. Words, no 
matter how eloquent, are merely inducements for getting started. The 
applicability of these conceptual ingredients provide avenues for explo­
ration, in which experiment must be expected to have a last word.
The given guidelines for widening the quantum mechanical horizon are 
fortunately not isolated items of the physics literature. Propositions to 
jointly treat indeterministic ensembles, and deterministic single systems or 
highly ordered ensembles, have recently been made by Barut^ and van 
FraassenJ There is a parallelism in their arguments, in the sense of stress­
ing the need for a two-tier approach to quantum mechanics. The cited 
studies differ from the present undertaking in the choice of mathematical 
tooling for treating deterministic situations. They accommodate determin­
ism with the help of the standard Schroedinger formalism. The here chosen 
approach selects a typically global tool for treating determinism. It is the 
existence of such deterministic tooling in the form of period integrals that 
brings the Barut and van Fraassen two-tier approaches further to a logical 
conclusion.
Finally, a word is in order about a footnote added to the English 
translation of Popper's book on the logic of scientific discovery. 1 He spec­
ifies in some detail the ensembles he considers. Over and above spatial en­
sembles, he recognizes ensembles distributed in time in the sense of a 
stream of systems; say particles coming in one at a time. The Debye- 
Scherrer and Davisson-Germer experiments convey such a picture. Since 
the latter comes suspiciously close to Gibbs' abstract ensemble of conceiv­
able manifestations of one and the same system, Popper was reaching out to 
accommodate a Copenhagen view. This conciliatory act may have helped 
single-systems and ensembles to coexist with indeed minimal undue con­
frontation.

14
CHAPTER I
The spatially distributed example of many systems of random phase and 
orientation is in the following chapters recognized for its ability to permit 
a measure of system interaction capable of securing ensemble randomness. 
In chapter in the existence of zero-point energy is established to be a sine 
qua non for an equilibrium state of ensemble disorder. Without disorder 
there is no statistics. The alternative then is the deterministic branch of 
quantum mechanics, which is discussed in chapter VI.
The long time coexistence of Copenhagen and statistical ensemble inter­
pretations has, in the course of time, led to the consensus formulated by 
Barut and van Fraassen. Yet, notwithstanding their ensemble-nature, 
Schroedinger and Dirac theories have had an undeniable, albeit qualitative, 
constructive role for some wholly ordered ensembles such as for instance 
occur in the theory of ferromagnetism. The Aufbau principle of atomic 
shell structure is another example where single system insight has benefited 
from ensemble-based methodology, provided, of course, it is used in 
conjunction with the Pauli principle.
It is a matter of adapting new theory after the facts. Hund's rules of fer­
romagnetism and the ideas of atomic shell structure, though, were already 
established prior to the Schroedinger equation. The history of physics over 
more than a half century has been replete with successful examples 
testifying to a cross-fertilization of ideas ensuing from the asymptotic 
relations between ensembles and single systems. It is almost undoable to 
identify every one of these cases.
Yet, in the long run, a further straddling of the fence between two fun­
damentally distinct realms of physical experience can only testify to a belief 
that one can have one's cake and eat it too. How did physics get caught in 
tolerating an obvious state of schizophrenia between single-system and 
ensemble?
An explanation, in part, resides in later developments that have been 
erected on typically nonclassical Copenhagen premises. Quantum electro­
dynamics (QED) manifests such nonclassical contingencies. Bluntly aban­
doning Copenhagen premises would be synonymous with discarding the 
great triumphs of QED. Hence, a sine qua non for abandoning Copenhagen 
is finding QED alternatives with adequate promise of achievement.
Questions and perspectives concerning such QED alternatives, without 
the use of nonclassical metaphors, are confronted in chapters VIII, IX and 
XI.

THE COPENHAGEN ERA

CHAPTER H
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
1. A Psychological Angle to the History
With the advent of modem quantum mechanics in 1925, physics entered 
an entirely new phase of conceptual imagery. The words "nonclassical" 
versus "classical" became the characteristic hallmark, not only of the 
ensuing developments in the subject matter, but also for the protagonists 
involved in this real-life drama. More perhaps than at any time prior to 
that revolution did a younger generation suspect the older generation of 
being unable to grasp the new trend of things in physics.
Many of the *25 generation have now passed away, and some of them 
may have themselves experienced a similar feeling of abandonment vis-a- 
vis the subsequent developments of quantum electrodynamics and quantum 
chromodynamics, each roughly covering another 25-year generation inter­
val. Perhaps some of these pioneers may now be having second thoughts 
about the reservations of the oldies of their past. It is the near-inescapable 
risk of treading new territory. The privilege of exploration knows disap­
pointments as well as triumphs for all ages.
Extracting meaningful predictions from manipulating energy infinities 
in quantum electrodynamics (QED) is no minor achievement. Yet, the 
methods to do so grate on the mathematical conscience, and correctly so. 
Power engineers may wonder about the reality of energy infinities stored 
in the electrodynamic vacuum. Can they give perspectives on a future 
where the impossible becomes possible?
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has revealed itself to be even more 
ambitious than QED. QCD has now, in principle, confessed to a possible 
unobservability of what it professes to be the fundamental constituents of 
matter. I am speaking of quarks, with gluons holding them together. 
However, in case the unobservability thesis might be mistaken, there is a 
consensus not to refrain from building bigger accelerators to make or see 
quarks. In the meantime, theorists cover a possible reality of unobservabil­
ity by model simulation with ever more powerful computers. Some chro- 
modynamicists claim quarks will lead to an ultimate understanding of the 
early universe, say, before it was a few minutes or a tiny fraction-of-a-sec- 
ond old.
These metaphors have not been extracted from science fiction. They 
can be read in responsible and reputable reports about the developments of
16

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
17
modem science. Compare hereto a nontechnical account by Michael 
Riordanl for an insider's view about the search for quarks. The epiloque 
of that monograph on quarks gives a realistic and fair summary of the way 
of thinking and methods of working in contemporary particle physics. He 
says:"...what science does remarkably well, again and again, is to build sur­
prisingly successful images of the universe." Such endeavors remain useful, 
even if their relation to reality (as we may conceive it) seems tenuous.
Accepting these journalistic accounts as fair and reliable, we see man, in 
his assessment of Nature, projecting the event of his own birth as a major 
episode by attributing similar happenings to the universe itself. Since man 
is part of Nature, the idea is not unreasonable, even if the extrapolation 
seems outrageous.
Mindful of the transient nature of man's efforts, let us go back to the 
moment in time when things started to change for the physical sciences. 
The year which shook the older generation, in a manner more than ever 
before, was 1925. In fact, not only the older generation, but also the 
generation that partook in the revolution, responded with a strange 
undertone of disenchantment. Schroedinger himself did not refrain from 
expressing discomfort about where his own creations were heading.
More than at any time before, was the scope and realm of validity of 
new physical theory no longer determined by a theoretical derivation of its 
new tools, because there was no real derivation. The Schroedinger equa­
tion is a tool in question. Its merits were decided by what it could do, and 
not by its heavenly origin. This seemingly egalitarian view, however, 
masked an attitude of prejudice in the physics community. This wave equa­
tion instrument of modem physics was hailed with a near-religious fervor 
as a divine gift. Most textbooks on quantum mechanics excel in praise, yet 
few give an appraisal of limitations. In later life Schroedinger himself 
turned away from his own brainchild. Its shrouded origin prevented him 
from arriving at the understanding for which he had hoped.
Yet, notwithstanding this admitted measure of conceptual incomplete­
ness, it did not turn out to be a shortcoming that prevented Schroedinger's 
equation from becoming the single most important tool of modem physics. 
Without adequate understanding of what makes it work, we are here con­
fronted with one of the most fertile and effective developments of modem 
physics. Mindful that understanding can be in the mind of the beholder, 
the question at this juncture was, and still is: what measure of subjectivity 
can we afford without really jeopardizing the fundamental quality of 
physics as an objective science?
There is certainly no argument that Schroedinger's equation is a physi­
cally most relevant instrument of modem physics. It is so relevant that 
many physicists and engineers have developed a very pragmatic attitude 
with respect to its application. The transmission-line pioneer Oliver 

18
CHAPTER II
Heaviside, who excelled in unorthodox mathematics, used to say he could 
enjoy a meal without knowing how it had been prepared. The quantum 
engineers similarly found out that you don't have to know what the 
Schroedinger equation means to see the physics of its solutions.
Coherence of subject material is not served if new generations are 
taught pragmatism with a flavor of unwarranted superiority with respect to 
those who want to understand more. It can serve as a crutch, but may give 
false reassurances in the long run. Such methods are not fair to newcomers, 
whose judgment is bound to be vulnerable, because they are so over­
anxious to get ahead in an over-competitive world. While it is true that 
wisdom does not necessarily coincide with advancing age, keep in mind 
there is always a chance that it does. By prematurely rejecting experiences 
of the past, and by letting pragmatism trample the insights of yesterday, we 
shortchange ourselves and the subject matter. Pragmatism has its limita­
tions, even for getting ahead in the world.
Let us now address those who feel an obligation to make an honest 
attempt at understanding. This requires more of an inquiry into what the 
Schroedinger equation could possibly mean. The two major options have 
been, and still are today, the Copenhagen interpretation and the slightly 
more restrictive ensemble interpretation. While Copenhagen supports 
applicability of methods to ensembles and single systems alike, the ensem­
ble people have been holding out for a more restricted realm of applicabil­
ity, namely, an ensemble of identical systems that are deemed to be in a dis­
ordered state of interaction. Hence, the ensemble interpretation could be 
considered, if you will, as being vaguely contained in the Copenhagen in­
terpretation. All we are talking about here is really imposing a restriction 
on the use of the Schroedinger equation (i.e., backtracking slightly from 
the 1925+ revolution). As matters stand today, that is still seen as a 
counterrevolution, or heresy.
At the year of the revolution, 1925, all experimental input came from 
observations on ensembles of identical systems. Notwithstanding this en­
semble reality of facts, the Copenhagen School included single systems, 
without adequate verification. Copenhagen was seemingly affected by an 
overriding desire of coming up with a once-and-for-all final solution, a last 
stone of wisdom, if you will.
The proponents of an ensemble picture unfortunately remained rather 
inarticulate about the nature of their ensemble. In the light of this seem­
ingly passive attitude of the ensemble proponents, it may become under­
standable why the Copenhagen view won out over the strict ensemble view. 
The latent desire of presenting a more encompassing result dominated the 
thinking of the Copenhagen School. The extrapolation of the Schroedinger 
methods into the domain of single systems was at best supported by

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
19
asymptotic relevance of the results. This unjustified step remains a latent 
shortcoming of the Copenhagen initiative.
The desire to extend the use of methods to single systems led to a string 
of now-famous specifications which, in turn, have led to a much longer 
string of logical and epistemological inquiries. It is at this point where 
modem quantum mechanics acquired its most prominent and notorious 
nonclassical features. Many of the beloved mysticisms of quantum me­
chanics have their roots in the desire of wanting to deal with single isolated 
systems. Since this aspect is a projected "piece de resistance" of quantum 
reprogramming, let it suffice to mention here these nonclassical features 
and how they logically interrelate.
(1) The single particle and Bom's probability amplitude triggers a 
tongue-in-cheek suggestion of point particles.
(2) Soothing the conscience about so bold a step, a finite spatial presence 
is reintroduced for the point particle with the help of the uncertainty prin­
ciple, and behold, this a priori uncertainty is even derivable from the wave 
function.
(3) The particle-wave duality becomes a dichotomy of indecision be­
tween single particle and ensemble plurality.
(4) Restricting the formalism to ensembles automatically resolves the 
perennial dispute about completeness of description. The description of a 
statistical ensemble is incomplete by choice!
(5) Since typical ensemble information is nonlocal, a conflict with 
Bell's theorem need not be feared. The latter envisions only local hidden 
variables pertaining to a presumed single system. All considerations relat­
ing to Bell's theorem are made in the perspective of the utterly frail hy­
pothesis of a single-system connotation for the Schroedinger equation. 
(compare chapter V; 6)
The willingness to accept the cited leaps of faith demanded by the 
Copenhagen point of view can only be explained in the light of the tremen­
dous success of the process. The attitude of not arguing with success is no 
excuse, though, to remain uncritical of those achievements. In fact, rela­
tively little effort has been invested in finding out how much of this success 
was really contingent on a full acceptance of the Copenhagen point of view, 
because it is not "wise" to argue with success.
The new picture was emotionally appealing. For the first time in the 
history of physics, "uncertainty" told man about his limitations. Yet, this 
apparent humbleness was not perceived as treading on exactly the territory 
where only the gods were supposed to go. The protagonists of 
"uncertainty" were telling us that they knew what Nature had in mind to let 
us know!
One can hardly deny that physics in the late Twenties and early Thirties 
had taken a religious turn. There is today still that nearly unlimited faith 

20
CHAPTER II
that Schroedinger will bring us there, even though Schroedinger himself 
expressed his doubts in no uncertain terms. A fair measure of knowing 
had been obtained largely by a measure of faith, which was not quite com­
mensurate with that gain in knowledge. While intermediate phases of faith 
versus knowledge are essential in physics, the integrity of the subject re­
quires keeping tabs on them. We need good judgment when we are dealing 
with faith as well as knowledge.
The position taken in the here-given discussion is that some of the reli­
giously flavored aspects of faith in contemporary quantum mechanics are 
due for revision. The objective is one of reducing a premature dependence 
on faith by a more detailed delineation of options. Mindful that changes in 
a religious-type faith are harder to accomplish than changes in intellectual 
conviction, a rocky road must be expected. Yet, the reward of a better 
synthesis between classical and nonclassical concepts and a state of 
improved harmony with the neighboring disciplines of mathematics and 
philosophy may be worth it.
To see whether it is all worth the effort, let us sneak in a preview of 
new perspectives that emerge in the process of abandoning some prejudices 
based on unverified faith. Looking back, one then wonders why, for so 
long, certain aspects of faith could have dominated over simple provable 
truth. Let us check this measure of faith in subjects of great current inter­
est.
Any time quarks are shown as baryon constituents in illustrations, they 
are depicted as a collection of neat little spheres huddled together in a 
domain of space that is taken to be a proton or a neutron. To delineate spe­
cific quark species, the little spheres may be colored. We all know that 
those pretty colored pictures are meant to be, at best, mnemonic devices 
that are not to be taken literally as a gospel truth. Yet, even the choice of 
mnemonic device reveals a clue as to what is in the mind of those who 
make such pictures.
A comparison with past attempts at illustrating the submicroscopic 
world makes us think of the Lorentz electron. The latter, also pictured as a 
little ball, was said to have a small but finite radius; later, the Copenhagen 
interpretation surreptitiously converted it into a point. A major difference 
between Lorentz' electron and the modem quark is that the electron has an 
observed whole unit of elementary electric charge, whereas the quark is 
believed to have a not-yet-observed multiple of one-third of elementary 
charge; a 3-fold symmetry in charge manifestation, though, is feasible.
The comparison between quark and electron reveals how geometric 
modelling of elementary entities has not since Lorentz made much 
progress. Both are represented as little spheres. By the time the electron 
was discovered to have a spin and a magnetic moment, a conversion of the 
electron ball into an electron ring current had been found to give the 

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
21
wrong gyromagnetic ratio by a factor two. Shortly thereafter, Dirac theory 
gave a more nearly correct gyroratio, without any geometric model what­
soever. Physics was now ready to accept a point-electron, because it con­
veniently fitted the requirements of the probability picture of a single 
electron presence.
The art of living is the art of making concessions. Yet, in doing so, it is 
important to know when compromise is a temporary rest on the road to 
further reaching solutions in the future. The electron-quark situation 
makes us aware of the relatively simplistic models that are being used. In 
fact there is hardly any model at all. It is either ball or point. Rings had 
earlier been discarded for their faulty gyro ratio. Conclusion: Since 
Lorentz, no efforts have been made to see elementary particles as having a 
topological presence more sophisticated than a ball or a point.
Since the geometry of macroscopic objects has been able to invite 
thoughts about more sophisticated topological structures, one cannot help 
wondering why Nature would not have used such potentialities in the sub- 
microscopic domain of elementary particles. There are several reasons 
why contemporary physics has so far refrained from an exploration of 
these potentialities. Wrong answers at the first attempts created a consen­
sus that in keeping with the successful Dirac approach, abstract procedures 
were the way to go. It stands to reason to let Nature talk before putting it 
prematurely into a topological mold. Yet, if ring models were found to be 
deficient, should not balls and points also be regarded as relics from mod­
elling land?
Closer scrutiny reveals how physics boxed itself into a comer with the 
single-system extrapolated concept of quantum uncertainty. As it presently 
stands, it prevents a direct probing of the submicroscopic domain. Then in 
one of those sweeping classical-* nonclassical transitions, it is said that 
macroscopic notions of space and time are declared to be not applicable in 
the microdomain (chapterIV, ref. 13). Such burning of the bridges to the 
micro-domain would hardly be justified without first giving the macro-* 
micro extrapolation better scrutiny.
Quantum mechanical uncertainty, as advocated by the Copenhagen 
School, literally blocks invitations for probing the submicroscopic domain. 
The thesis of actual physical uncertainty (as distinguished from a more 
abstract indeterminateness) is equivalent to saying that macroscopic 
concepts of space simply do not apply in the submicroscopic domain. 
Physics thus pushed itself into a comer of its own making, from which 
there is no escape. This has opened the door to many untamed nonclassical 
conjectures; in panic, anything goes to get out of that comer.
To get out of the comer, it will be necessary to backtrack some on the 
path that got us into the dead-end situation. Since the inaccessibility of the 

22
CHAPTER II
micro-domain has been at the root of the mounting troubles, let us examine 
neglected evidence that can help bridge the macro/micro gap of contempo­
rary physics.
2. The Metric Odyssey
The one and only physical entity that can be used to gauge an absolute 
size of physical objects and an absolute speed of physical manifestations is 
the spacetime metric. Hence, before launching into untamed speculations 
about the micro-physical domain, physics has the responsibility of investi­
gating first the interplay between physical law and the metric. The met­
ric's physical role and implications were first explicitly brought to the sur­
face of awareness by Minkowski and Einstein. The spatial components of 
the metric were around, prior to the relativity era. They came already ex­
plicitly to the fore in the Lagrangian and Hamilton-Jacobi descriptions of 
mechanics.
Most physicists are disinclined to accept the metric as a physical field 
on the same level, say as an electric- or magnetic field. A major reason is 
that in most physical applications the metric field does not emerge as an 
explicit physical entity, because the frames of reference, customarily used 
in physics, have been calibrated beforehand in such a manner that the spa­
tial metric assumes the "invisible" diagonal form {1,1,1}; the correspond­
ing spacetime form is then {c2,-l,-l,-l}.
It was the general theory of relativity that really brought the metric out 
of the woodwork as having field properties. Its basic postulate holds out 
for the premise that changes in the metric (field) and its associated cali­
bration, are determined by the distribution of matter. Since this theory has 
shown a fair measure of experimental relevance, we are well advised not to 
ignore the metric, even if those changes due to the influence of matter are 
very small indeed.
Now that the metric is known to be not physically trivial as a field, one 
may next inquire whether there are physical law statements that do not 
invoke the metric. After first going out of our way to identify the nature 
of the metric, it seems odd to subsequently inquire about the existence of 
metric-independent physical laws. The truth of the matter is: one cannot 
well establish the independence of something unless that something has first 
been clearly identified.
The mathematical techniques of establishing metric independence can be 
rather involved for differential expressions. For integral expressions it can 
be simpler, because, for integrals, metric independence may frequently be 
postulated from the start. The differential expressions ensuing from appli­
cations of Stokes theorem can be expected to be metric-independent if the 
cyclic Stokes integral itself is taken metric-independent. Stokes theorem 
is a metric-independent diffeo-invariant theorem.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
23
For differential expressions, metric independence means form-invari­
ance under arbitrary coordinate substitutions, without having to take re­
course to metric-related operations such as covariant derivation. Metric 
independence is to be distinguished from trivial situations in which the 
metric can be made invisible, such as occurs under the orthogonal groups. 
Nontrivial metric-independent invariance in physical spacetime is a metric 
diffeo-4 invariance which invokes neither the metric nor so-called coeffi­
cients linear displacement.
To circumvent at this juncture undue mathematical technicalities, it is 
best to focus on physical laws permitting an integral formulation. In fact, 
many physical laws do! Many differential formulations are mathematically 
inferred from integral statements. The invariant features of physical law- 
related integrals are found to be conspicuously reflected in their structure 
from a point of view of physical dimensions.
Those used to assessing physical entities in terms of physical dimensions 
may at first be puzzled as to what metric-independence could possibly 
mean. The physical dimension of almost any physical quantity requires the 
metric units of time [t] and length [L] for its dimensional characterization. 
That being the case, how can one ever live in the hope of finding metric­
independent quantities and laws involving those quantities? An answer to 
this question is contingent on the choice of unit systems. More precisely, it 
depends on a suitable identification and arrangement of basic units.2
The old cgs system [m,l,t] only leaves mass [m] as a unit independent of 
the spatial metric, whereas the MKS system [m,q,L,t] has mass [m] and 
charge [q] as units independent of the spatial metric. Yet only the unit [q] is 
a spacetime invariant; mass [m] is not. Consistency about splitting units into 
invariant units versus those associated with transformation [l,t] invites re­
placing the noninvariant unit of mass [m] by the spacetime invariant Planck 
unit [h] of action. The system [h,q,L,t] has the advantage of two invariant 
units [h,q] versus the two units [l,t] associated with spacetime transforma­
tion^ Note that Nature provides here the basic elementary units of electric 
charge [q=e] and of elementary action [h] ; they don't change, regardless of 
what man chooses to be his preferred units for length or time.
The metric-free laws of physics turn out to relate to one-, two- and 
three-dimensional cyclic integrals (e.g., Gauss’ integral) counting a 
number of charge units [q] (or [e]), a number of action units [h], or 
products or ratios thereof. The proven spacetime topological, metric-free, 
invariance of those cyclic integrals makes their residues totally independent 
of whimsical human preferences for length and time measures such as 
inches, meters, noses, seconds or jiffies. Who would like to maintain that 
the counting of units [e] and [h], whose proven identity is a gift of Nature, 

24
CHAPTER II
could possibly be contingent upon man choosing a spacetime frame with a 
preordained unit calibration?
While this seems a roundabout way of conveying the existence of 
metric-free physical laws, the fact is: sometimes only flippancy can shake 
up certain established opinions. There are several customs in physics 
pertaining to choices of physical units and several procedures of spacetime 
invariance which shroud this very issue. The whole thing of metric­
independence could be mentioned in two lines, yet experience has taught 
that communications of such brevity don't register.
In avoiding mathematical technicalities, the counting of universal quan­
tum units is perhaps the most transparent and convincing form in which 
this message of metric-free physical law can be conveyed. The identifi­
cation of metric-free physical laws is definitely not a personal invention of 
this author. The discoveries date back to the early part of this century; 
some of it took place prior to the general theory of relativity, and later 
contributions emerged as a by-product thereof. Hargreaves in England and 
Kottler in Vienna first uncovered features of this peculiarity, then Cartan 
in Paris and later van Dantzig in Amsterdam; all of them are reviewed by 
Whittaker.3 Since nobody quite knew what to do with metric independence, 
the discovery remained dormant for a long time. Kuessner^ revived 
attention for those matters in Germany in 1946. An article by Truesdell 
and ToupinS in the respectable Handbuch der Physik focused on the global 
formulation of laws of physics and their relation to metric-independence. 
Yet, physics at large did not heed suggestions that the notion of metric-free 
could be of any physical consequence.
Since I have been a witness to many responses of pragmatic physicists at 
the mere suggestion of the existence of metric-free physical laws, I re­
member some of the commentary. It has ranged from indifference to utter 
scorn. It elicits remarks as: Metric-free law can have no meaning, real 
physics uses centimeters and seconds; would not the gods do the same?
Metric-free physics indeed sounded rather strange, just at the time when 
the general theory of relativity had found evidence of the spacetime met­
ric's quantitative role. It is, therefore, not surprising that almost no book 
on relativity even reports the existence of a metric-free quantum super­
structure of relativity. In the context of relativity, the notion of metric-free 
is not even mentioned as a point of potential mathematical interest!
3. Quantum Mechanics and Relativity (see chapter XV)
Shortly after the emergence of modem quantum mechanics, its compat­
ibility with the premises of relativity started to preoccupy physicists. While 
Dirac successfully merged quantum mechanics with the special theory, the 
general theory remained a holdout defying conceptual integration. Efforts 

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
25
to "quantize" the gravitational field remained without physical conse­
quence. The credos of quantization and relativity continued manifesting 
signs of persistent alienation.
In the meantime no attention had been given to the metric-free nature of 
at least some quantum laws. Why does Nature reveal metric-free features 
of quantization (e.g., Aharonov-Bohm and Ampere-Gauss laws), while 
prevailing efforts in physics have been quantizing metric-related matters 
such as gravitation, which is exactly the thing that Nature seems to avoid? 
This brings us to the need for recapitulating the metric-free options on the 
basis of their physical merits.
The first and most important reason is that metric-free laws should be 
valid in the macro- as well as in the micro-domain, because, without a met­
ric, laws cannot be restricted by matters pertaining to size or speed.
The second important feature has to do with the nature of the laws 
that are emerging as metric-free. They are cyclic residue integrals, also 
called period integrals, counting quantum states of the object under consid­
eration. These period integrals are distinguished by spacetime metric-free 
general invariance.
Finally the third important feature is a natural and we//-established re­
lation between period integrals and an important branch of topology, which 
has been pioneered by de Rham. It is known as "de Rham cohomology."
The just stated three principal features largely resolve the 
presumed incompatibility between the general theory of relativ­
ity and the quantum theory.
Why was the general psychological condition in physics so little inclined 
to give attention to metric-free aspects and the associated notions of topol­
ogy? Consider hereto that Einstein was not listened to by the pragmatists 
when he maintained that the principle of general spacetime covariance had 
played a crucial role for him in the structural make-up of his general the­
ory of relativity. As a result, the subsequent discovery of metric-free 
spacetime covariance never made the grade in physics, nor did it quite 
register with Einstein. Correspondence between Cartan and Einstein never 
touched the topic of metric-free (communication by John Stachel). These 
are the ironies of history! It was noted earlier that Schroedinger also was 
not listened to by the pragmatists when he verbalized his disagreement with 
the Copenhagen interpretation.
Pragmatic physicists have a strange habit of grabbing an item of re­
search, stripping it from what they consider to be redundant detail, and 
then telling the originator of the research: thank you for what you have just 
done, but now leave us alone with the version we have given it. This hap­
pened to Schroedinger, Einstein and even Maxwell^ when he pioneered a 
diversity of vector species. His attempts at explaining to the 19th century 
physics establishment his electrodynamics in terms of mechanical models 

26
CHAPTER II
backfired, because it was later interpreted as reflecting "classical" limita­
tions in his own understanding.
After Schroedinger's "smeared out" version of the electron had been 
discarded for valid reasons, the Copenhagen School came out with its 
probability version, which still remained in the single-system vein of 
Schroedinger himself. Schroedinger vehemently rejected this alternative. 
Subsequently, Popper, Einstein and others raised the option of considering 
an ensemble. By that time few people were listening to Schroedinger, 
Einstein, or for that matter, the philosopher Popper.
After this had happened, some pragmatists had pangs of conscience and 
felt something should still be done to reconcile quantum mechanics with the 
general theory of relativity. As might be expected, the going was not easy, 
after the principle of general covariance had just been declared void of in­
trinsic physical content. Several transcriptions of renedering Dirac's spe­
cial relativistic equations into a generally covariant form were attempted. 
Except for unbelievably complex equations, nothing came out of it in the 
sense of new physics.
Yet in the following the principle of general covariance will stand re­
stored, but restricted here to metric-free situations that have a perspective 
of counting quanta with the help of period integrals. The interpretation of 
the Schroedinger equation, by contrast, is restricted to ensembles of appro­
priate disorder-a situation without an obvious bearing on general covari­
ance. Many mysticisms of quantum mechanics and the latter's incompati­
bility with the general theory of relativity so resolve themselves. Indeed 
ensemble behavior hardly qualifies as a feature to be given spacetime 
frame-independence. Yet, if it is to have any meaning at all, counting 
Nature's natural quanta should better be frame-independent!
Having thus delineated the heretic objective of trimming down 
Copenhagen applicability to a level of enhanced objective reality, the ques­
tion still remains how this goal can best be realized. It has been tried many 
times by people of unquestionable competence and insight. A perusal of 
Jammer's^ book on the philosophy of quantum mechanics gives exhaustive 
evidence of what has been done before. So allow me to state in what 
respect this issue has now come closer to a state of fruition.
There are now a number of experiments, which more than ever before 
point to a need for change (e.g., quantum Hall effect, single-particle inter­
ferometry and squeezed optical states). Yet, physics remains suspicious of 
change just for the sake of change, and rightly so. In presenting this sub­
ject matter, one finds oneself in a predicament of choice. Presenting the 
bare physical facts tends to generate a request for more background. Yet if 
this background comes in part from neighboring disciplines of philosophy 
and mathematics, people say: give me the physical facts and never mind the 
philosophy! Let philosophy invent new words and let mathematics worry 

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
27
about proving things that turn out to be perfectly obvious; "we" want 
physics! These are typical responses to be expected in a science atmosphere 
that has suffered too long from too much specialization.
An interdisciplinary approach seems the only reasonable answer to re­
solving these difficulties. Those who want "bare facts" of physics should 
have no trouble finding them in the table of contents or in references. By 
the same token, bare facts may lead to conceptual leaps outside the 
traditional framework of physics. The reader may sense whether they are 
philosophical or mathematical in nature, or possibly both. A recent 
philosophically oriented assessment polarizes the issue towards an ensemble 
aspect of quantum mechanics^ and the ensuing need of separate tools for 
ensembles and single systems.
Chapter VI (and following) in this collection give an extensive 
discussion of period integrals, from their earlier history in physics all the 
way to their modem use in mathematics as tools for probing topology. 
Since this procedure is contingent on an abandoning of traditional views of 
quantum uncertainty, the discussions culminate again and again in a detailed 
plea of support for an ensemble view of the Schroedinger equation.
Having thus identified ensembles as the selected domain of applicability 
for Schroedinger's equation, we come full circle by looking for new tools 
that need to be identified for the treatment of single systems. All of which 
brings us back to period integrals as the instrument of choice. Their initial 
use in physical field theory reveals how, quite early in the game, 
researchers sensed their potential as a bridge between local and global per­
ceptions of Nature. Yet while contemporary physics lost itself in local 
spinor formalisms, mathematics led the way in exploring global 
spinorization and a use of period integrals in the topology of manifold 
structure. Topology is regarded as one of the esoteric branches of modem 
mathematics, which unfortunately is a quality not helpful for winning 
popularity in physics.
There is another hurdle! Mathematicians have not always responded 
in a positive manner to a physics invasion of their territory. Some mathe­
maticians fear injury to their beloved discipline and contamination of the 
pristine beauty of topology. In the present context they may not approve of 
impending changes to topology's standard geometric backdrop, if physics 
becomes a topic of topological concern. The traditionally static geometric 
backdrop of topology envisioned in mathematics needs in physics an added 
dynamic aspect of change. Probing into this new territory remains ex­
ploratory. It holds promise of giving Feynman diagrams a wider basis in 
topology. New applications abound, once stumbling blocks are removed 
(chapters XII, XIII).
Most contemporary inroads made by topology into the realm of physics 
have not taken place in spacetime itself. Instead superstructures in the 

28
CHAPTER II
realm of multidimensional configuration spaces of quantum states are being 
probed. In this manner one hopes to learn more about spacetime as the 
real cradle of those superstructures. The dogma of universal uncertainty 
has caused this flight from spacetime to a state space of configurations. As 
long as universal uncertainty rules supreme, it will project its limitations 
on knowledge about the underlying spacetime.
The multidimensional superstructure predicament is here avoided by 
probing spacetime directly. Chapter VI first explores what is already there 
in the form of physical laws that have been or can be cast in terms of 
residue integrals. These fragments of topological structure are comple­
mented in chapter XIII to form a system in the sense of a de Rham 
cohomology.
4. Some Milestones in Quantum Physics
In order to see how these matters relate to the past, it will be useful to 
provide an overview of the conceptual highlights of quantum mechanics 
between 1900 and 1981. The selection and emphasis of topics has been cho­
sen to serve the purpose of this discussion. (Please consult index for more 
detailed discussions of topics, names and relevant literature.)
1900: Planck obtains the spectral black body radiation law by interpo­
lating between the Raleigh-Jeans and Wien laws. He achieves this result 
with the help of the artifact that resonator energy can only change in steps 
of magnitude E = hoo.
1905: Einstein reaffirms the relevance of the discrete energy exchange 
E = h<jL> in his explanation of the photo-electric effect.
1912: Planck introduces zero-point energy 1tgo/2 as an ensemble 
condition for a collective of phase random harmonic oscillators to retain a 
positive Boltzmann probability. Phase space (plane) discreteness is Planck's 
favored method of describing quantization: |Jdpdq = h = 2Tr1h.
1913: Bohr extends the Planck-Einstein hypothesis E = tiaj with the 
hypothesis that angular momentum L changes in discrete steps L = h. He 
thus obtains the spectral formula for hydrogen.
1915: Sommerfeld obtains the fine structure of hydrogen with the help 
of relativistic considerations. He extends Bohr's angular momentum con­
dition of 1913, and thus converts Planck's phase space condition of 1912 
as a quantization of cyclic phase integrals of analytic dynamics |pdq = nh; 
n=l,2,.... The latter are now known as the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions of 
the "older" quantum theory.
1916: Einstein gives a very elegant and universal derivation of Planck's 
law of black-body radiation of 1900, by using concepts of spontaneous and 
induced emission.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
29
1917: Einstein explores certain topological aspects of the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld line integral, e.g., how it breaks up into invariant parts char­
acterizing the orbital manifold. Each of the component parts is a multiple 
of h. Here is, in a way, a physical precursor of de Rham's later mathemat­
ical work.
1923: De Broglie converts Bohr's angular momentum condition into a 
local linear momentum condition p = bk. He postulates, in essence, the 
proportionality of the four-vectors of energy momentum and the frequency 
wave vector (E;p) = b(oo;l<)
1923: Duane independently "derives" the relation p = bk, as restricted 
to photons, from Bragg’s X-ray diffraction formula by using the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld condition of 1915.
1925: Heisenberg initiates matrix mechanics. Bom and Jordan further 
mold it into an algorithm for calculating stationary quantum states of 
"systems" as algebraic eigenvalue process. The method reproduces Planck's 
zero-point energy of 1912.
1926: Using the Broglie-Duane relation of 1923, Schroedinger con­
structs a wave equation, which also gives quantization as a spectrum of 
eigenvalues. Schroedinger and Pauli establish the equivalence between the 
matrix eigenvalue process and the wave eigenvalue process.
1927: Experimental confirmation of de Broglie's relation by Davisson- 
Germer and Thomson-Reid.
1927: Dirac constructs a wave equation capable of dealing with spin­
particles, which amazingly reproduces Sommerfeld's (spinless) fine struc­
ture formula of 1915.
1927: Heisenberg introduces the concept of uncertainty as a general 
property associated with individual isolated systems. Kennard and Weyl 
relate this uncertainty to statistical implications of the solutions of the 
Schroedinger wave equation.
1930: The probability view of quantum mechanics is further codified 
and emerges as what is now known as the Copenhagen interpretation. 
Bohr, Bom and Heisenberg are regarded as the principal authors of the en­
suing descriptional role of the wave function for single systems. This 
probability picture led to an array of what became later known as nonclas- 
sical imagery. Here is an overview of the most important and prevalent 
nonclassical concepts generated by the Copenhagen School:
I Complementarity or wave-particle duality
II The point-particle concept
III Universal uncertainty for single objects
IV The notion of wave function collapse
1932: Von Neumann's completeness suggestion, quantum mechanics as 
a chapter in the spectral theory of Hilbert spaces.

30
CHAPTER II
1934: Popper's ensemble view and criticism of what now had become 
known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The en­
semble gave nonclassical a subterfuge status. Notwithstanding the consis­
tent appearance, from the Thirties until the present, of a number of 
reputable quantum texts written in the ensemble vein, the impact of the 
ensemble view remained very limited.
1935: An attempt at checking the inner consistency of the Copenhagen 
view by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR).
1937-1943: Wheeler-Heisenberg, S-matrix theory, making the wave 
function independent of the equations of motion.
1951: David Bohm's (local) hidden variables as potential evidence of 
incompleteness.
1961: The discovery of flux quantization (Doll and Fairbank).
1964: Bell's theorem, as comment on EPR criticism, states conse­
quences of the existence of hidden local variables.
1980: The discovery of the Quantum Hall effect (von Klitzing).
1981: Experiments by Aspect and coworkers rule out hidden local 
variables by not confirming Bell's inequalities.
A more detailed account of the vacillations concerning hidden variables 
is given in chapter V. The discussion revolves around the work of von 
Neumann, Bohm, Bell and Aspect, all of whom view the Schroedinger 
process as a single-system tool. Also Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) 
took the single-system view, yet with the objective of proving its inconsis­
tency. From a footnote in Einstein’s correspondence with Popper we know 
that Einstein was an ensemble (aggregate) supporter.
Just for the sake of polarizing opinions, let us conclude this milestone 
overview with a subjective assessment of the measures of surprise 
generated by some of these major quantum discoveries. The cited measures 
of surprise are, of course, subject to modification according to the views of 
the beholder. Here is first an explanation of the abbreviations in the last 
column of this list:
1: The surprise stroke of genius that led to the correct interpolation be­
tween then existing high and low frequency radiation laws. 2: First major 
application of Planck's new thesis. 3: Surprise payoff of sustained cryo­
genic program. 4: Bohr's stroke of genius accounting for the hydrogen 
spectrum is second major application of Planck's thesis. 5: Sommerfeld- 
Wilson-Epstein extend Bohr's hypothesis. 6: Proposing proportionality of 
4-vectors (E,p)=‘h(coJk). 7: Using Bohr-Sommerfeld integral to derive 
de Broglie's relation p = tik. 8: Sequence of leads by Compton, Kronig, 
Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck. 9: First mathematical specifics of a Fermion- 
Boson distinction. 10: Inductive arguments to transcribe Hamilton-Jacobi

commutation relations leading to an algebraic eigenvalue process. 
11: Schroedinger's use of de Broglie's relation to obtain a Hilbert-type dif- 
feo-integro eigen-value process. 12: Pauli, Schroedinger, von Neumann re­
late quantum process with theory of Hilbert spaces. 13: Dirac injects a to­
tally unexpected process for dealing with spin. 14: London predicted in the 
Thirties flux quanta of twice the size discovered by Doll-Naebauer and 
Deaver-Fairbank in the Sixties. 15: Hall impedance quanta were totally un­
expected by existing theory.

5. Avoiding Interdisciplinary Alienation
Through the centuries, mathematics and physics have been closely re­
lated disciplines. Sometimes physical inquiry led to the creation of a new 
mathematical discipline. The emergence of calculus as a tool needed for 
dealing with the Newtonian laws of motion is a conspicuous example. At 
other times there have been instances in which existing mathematics was 
instrumental for the development of new physical disciplines. Examples 
are the influence of group theory on the development of crystallography. 
The existence of Riemannian geometry was crucial for the formulation of 
the general theory of relativity. Finally, there is the theory of Hilbert 
spaces as a tool for quantum mechanics.
A cursory glance at these examples already reveals a change in the in­
terdisciplinary relations between mathematics and physics. While, in 
Newton's and Euler's days, much new mathematics had its origin in physi­
cal inquiry, in recent times much basic physics acquired, from the start, 
strong roots in the available mathematics. This change in interdependence 

32
CHAPTER II
has manifested itself in mathematics as an awareness of having come on its 
own. Mathematics is no longer the handmaiden of physics. In the per­
spective of the traditional references to physics and mathematics as the 
"king and queen" of the sciences, it now appears that the "queen" has 
become a fully emancipated lady.
There is now ample evidence that shows how mathematical research can 
help spawn new avenues of inquiry in physics. Whenever such changes in 
the mutual balance of interdependence are taking place, it is not unusual to 
see a tendency of going slightly overboard with a newly gained awareness 
of independence. Similarly as the Aristotelians envisioned a physics that 
could be guided solely by pure thought, without recourse to experimenta­
tion, some mathematicians felt it might be better for their beloved disci­
pline to stay "clean" by keeping away from physics.
There is no denying that there has been growing distance between 
mathematics and physics in this century. This alienation has not been good 
for science as a whole. It is the curse of overspecialization, compounded by 
uncalled-for discipline chauvinism, that is triggering such alienation. It cre­
ates a Tower of Babel effect; once languages begin to differ, it becomes 
more difficult to bridge the ensuing gaps in communications.
A practical result of the here-cited divergence is the following. 
Mathematicians, these days, get away with studying much less of physics 
than a century ago, whereas physicists are literally forced to study much 
more mathematics that has been produced by mathematicians who don't 
care too much for physics. The added mathematical burden in physics is 
bound to affect the quality of maturing. Faced with this information 
explosion, physics is coping with the situation, rather than controling it.
Whenever there is trouble mastering a new field, one can attempt to 
bolster the damaged ego by playing down the importance and relevance of 
all that newfangled stuff. Physicists have been heard loudly accusing math­
ematicians of wasting their time proving perfectly obvious things. 
Conversely, mathematicians accuse physicists of making uncivilized leaps 
of faith that are unacceptable in polite mathematical company.
While there is little wisdom or virtue in fostering these festering symp­
toms of alienation, the fact is, they are existing reality and as such they 
make constructive cooperation more difficult. Even if the pressure of re­
search funding can force a measure of cooperation, such funding forced 
cooperation pitches mathematicians (with, at best, a token background in 
physics) against physicists, who have a necessarily restricted feel and un­
derstanding for the sophistication of contemporary mathematical tooling.
The result of this confrontational situation is that the injection of new 
mathematical tooling in physics tends to occur somewhat ad hoc at inter­
mediate levels. There is no adequate attempt to start from scratch when it 
comes to mathematizing physical laws. Mathematicians, with little earlier 

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 1925 REVOLUTION
33
exposure to physics, are hardly inclined to tinker with the formulation of 
fundamental physical laws as they are handed over from physics. By the 
same token physicists are too unfamiliar with the new mathematical tech­
niques to feel at ease applying them to their full advantage. It is not hard to 
identify developments of this kind in physical theory over the past half 
century. It is all part of the so-called information explosion. There is an 
increasing flow of information of decreasing coherence.
The following chapters are an attempt at removing obstacles standing, 
right from the start, in the way of injecting new mathematical 
methodology. It will therefore be necessary to start at the classical level. 
In so doing, transitions to the so-called nonclassical levels of quantization 
assume a more natural character. In fact, quantization is a much more 
classical feature than it was made out to be in the past!
This approach collides with prevailing sentiments in physics. Topology 
assumes a more prominent place in the following chapters than what has 
been customary in standard physics discussions. By the same token a 
physics backdrop for topology militates against major sentiments in math­
ematics, which has so far preferred a static geometric backdrop. For rea­
sons only mathematicians know, it has been tradition that geometry has 
been considered as part of mathematics. For reasons only physicists know, 
physics has easily reconciled itself with the idea of leaving geometry in the 
hands of the mathematicians.
The reality of the physical world, however, demands a spacetime kine­
matic backdrop which imposes from the start a topological characterization 
distinguishing between "static" object structures and physical events, where 
seemingly "static" structures are converted into other seemingly "static" 
structures. The truth of the matter is, however, that the apparent static 
structures have a pronounced inner dynamics disguised by an image of sta- 
tionarity, which only makes it appear as static. The dynamics becomes 
even more dynamic, when the stationary dynamics has to make place for a 
conversion dynamics. It is the familiar scene in particle physics, when 
particles end their existence either by spontaneous disintegration into other 
more stable particles or else by a collision-induced disintegration.
In the sequel of these quantum reprogramming exercises, we may ex­
pect a confrontation with two major conceptual obstacles standing in the 
way of an intellectual reorientation in physics. First of all, there is the 
need to wean ourselves away from the Copenhagen suggestion that the 
Schroedinger equation is a cure-all for all conceivable quantum ailments. 
All of us have been brought up with such a not-altogether-justifiable belief 
that standard quantum mechanics will do the trick, if we only knew how. 
It is based on man's natural tendency for replacing lack of understanding 
by a measure of religious fervor; how else are we going to accept in good 
faith what cannot be quite accepted on the basis of strict logical persuasion?

34
CHAPTER II
Last, but not least, let us not close the eyes to the fact that even logical 
persuasion itself has, from time to time, been known to take recourse to a 
dogmatic sleight of hand.
So recognizing the realities of life by accepting the possibility that the 
Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics may not be quite the last word in 
physics' revelation to mankind, the question is: how can such act of heresy 
lead us to new and other worthwhile revelations that leave intact those ele­
ments that were known to be good in earlier experiences?
Let it be a source of comfort that some of that "new stuff" discussed 
here has already been around for some time. We just have a look at it from 
a slightly different angle. Period integrals, as discussed in later chapters, 
have been an integral part of physics for centuries. All the time we learn 
new things about them. In the process of weaning ourselves away from the 
cure-all suggestions of standard quantum methods, it is good to know that 
Copenhagen can be modified and complemented just by eliminating some 
uncalled-for interdisciplinary alienation.
The world is full of salesmanship. Everywhere are people who overes­
timate our resources. They want us to discard everything we have or 
know. Yet rather than blindly following such advice, it is reasonable to 
know beforehand a little bit of what we are getting into. It is all part of not 
rushing into decisions, the consequences of which we cannot fathom.

1. Getting There and Being There
In the eternal quest for truth, man has this very natural desire of finally 
wanting to arrive at some place of destination. It is the urge of trading a 
state of "getting there" for a state of "being there." We usually settle for a 
place, without having a clear idea of what the destination might be. After 
traveling long enough, we are tired, and just about any destination will do. 
The decision to keep moving or to rest is contingent upon whether we are 
at ease at the place of temporary residence.
In the process of traveling, it can happen that our ideas about the place 
of destination change. It is indeed a universal experience that our ideas of a 
place we have never seen before, but intend to visit, are totally different 
from the impressions we get once we see the place with our own eyes. 
This travel metaphor applies not only to places we visit physically, it also 
applies to people we have heard about, with whom we then later get ac­
quainted. By the same token, a field of studies is another example of some­
thing that can turn out to be totally different from what we initially imag­
ined it to be.
It can also happen that we arrive at places where we have never been, 
and yet we have this uncanny feeling of having been there. Most people 
like this experience, because it gives them a feeling of familiarity, say, of 
being at home. We like being at home unless dire experiences in life have 
made us apprehensive about home. Yet, even if home is not a good place, 
we tend to defend it in the hope of making it better at some time in the 
future.
The travel metaphor pervades all of man's pursuits in life. It can be 
traveling itself or constructing something; it also can be learning a new 
language or a new trade. Some people like to work on things and never 
finish; some car and boat owners are that way. They always work and 
never enjoy the fruits of their labor. There is an immense variety of spiri­
tual and intellectual experiences qualifying for this characterization. Let us 
scrutinize some, to ease the steps towards topics pertaining to physics.
In theology, man creates a world picture; the guidance it gives may be 
summarized in holy scriptures. They reflect the wisdom of earlier genera­
tions, or they are said to be "divinely inspired." Then, if new knowledge 
and experiences make it necessary to reinterpret the scriptures on which
35

36
CHAPTER III
this world picture is based, it is done with great care and circumspection. 
This process is, by nature, slow. Too many changes in too short a time 
cause the spiritual home to lose its aura of comfort and protection. It 
might come to pass that a home is no longer a home. We feel estranged and 
move about without much aim, trusting the guidance of serendipity.
To counteract the thus ensuing restlessness, some protectors and preach­
ers of the faith go to great length in reconciling new findings of science 
with their holy scriptures. They don't rest until they succeed in proving 
how everything newly discovered was already anticipated in their scrip­
tures; thus confirming their divine and holy sources of inspiration. They 
attempt replacing faith and belief in the holy scriptures by a conviction that 
their veracity stands, no matter what. While such techniques offer tempo­
rary solace, they harbor a danger of building faith on false convictions.
Since findings of science have been frequent causes of conflict between 
faith and conviction in theology, one would think science itself to be free of 
this protecting of the comforts of "being there" versus the uncertainties of 
"going there." Science is believed to have a measure of self-criticism not 
to get caught in this trap of complacency about having arrived at a station 
of knowledge where further exploration would not be necessary.
One would hope the syndrome of having reached a last stone of wisdom 
is unthinkable for science. Yet, since those who practice science are as im­
perfect as other mortals, one can be sure of finding the whole gamut of 
characters all the way from the perennial tinkerers to those who know it 
all. This can best be illustrated by inspecting one of the more esoteric dis­
ciplines of modem physics: quantum mechanics.
2. A Reminder of Not Yet Being There
An account of quantum history reveals some almost unavoidable reli­
gious elements invading the territory of science during the 1925-1935 
revolution. The already adopted terminology referring to a transition 
from classical to nonclassical physics assumed, during that time, an alto­
gether new meaning. In a letter to Schroedinger, who was one of the un­
willing activators of this movement, Einsteinl explicitly alluded to the 
soothing religious quality of the Bohr-Bom-Heisenberg (Copenhagen) in­
terpretation of the new quantum formalism. A book on the philosophy of 
quantum mechanics by Jammer^ gives ample testimony about this state of 
affairs. Look for references to Ballentine, Blokhintsev, Bunge, Collins, 
Einstein, Groenewold, Kemble, Lande, Popper, Slater and many others.
This chapter is an effort at explicitly pinning down some major ele­
ments of this religious infusion. There is the understandable tradition of 
using the methods of quantum mechanics (QM) as a cure-all for too many 
ailments and problems in physics. Since the tools of QM came as a "gift" 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
37
from heaven, their universal applicability has been taken too much as an 
almost foregone conclusion. This frame of mind tends to create a 
predilection for over-reliance on "gifts." It is our responsibility to probe 
the application potential of gifts in order to use them wisely.
In cases where reason could no longer guide the path concerning ques­
tions of applicability, man had to take recourse to a number of articles of 
faith. A major article claims, somewhat tongue in cheek, that the new QM 
methods would apply equally to single systems as to ensembles of such sin­
gle systems. The expected asymptotic physical behavior of a single system 
and the observed behavior of an actual ensemble of such single systems en­
couraged this dichotomous applicability.
This very extrapolation of dual applicability would later come to haunt 
physics in the form of a proposition holding a single particle to be dual to 
the essentially plural concept of wave. This led to several related concep­
tual contortions, all labeled under the heading nonclassical. Given the 
undisputed probability connotation of the wave function, the decision of 
single system applicability created a predicament as to what this probability 
was all about. It led to a priori quantum uncertainty and a corresponding 
zero-point energy affecting also single isolated particles. Last but not 
least, it gave birth to the tongue-in-cheek conception of the so-called point­
particle.
Once the nonclassical road had been chosen, it became compelling to 
invoke many more nonclassical constructs. In fact it triggers a never-end­
ing need for ideas such as nonclassical statistics, nonclassical logic, hidden 
variables, including internal consistency checks as embodied in Bell's theo­
rem. In short, a near-unlimited number of things, not understandable in 
terms of more conventional concepts, had to be collected under the inde­
terminate heading of nonclassical.
Of course, physics would not be a discipline covering an ever-widening 
area of unusual phenomena if everything had to be assessed in terms of al­
ready known conventional concepts. Yet, whenever the initial steps of 
change develop into an avalanche of ever-increasing change, such facts are 
to be heeded as a warning that something got out of hand. This impression 
is reinforced if one considers that all these perennial Copenhagen problems 
can be resolved in almost one fell swoop if the QM methods are being re­
stricted to ensembles of identical systems; provided these ensembles obey a 
measure of disorder regarding mutual system phase and system orientation. 
It can hardly be denied that all observational evidence underlying the QM 
procedures of 1925-1935 was, without exception, ensemble-based. Mindful 
of this factual state of affairs, one should now explicitly ask the question: 
what prompted the QM extrapolation to single systems, and what was the 
justification?

38
CHAPTER III
Answering the last part of the question first, one finds that no contem­
porary textbook of QM offers a justification for this extrapolation. All of 
which brings us to the first part of the question: what prompted it? It is 
hard to say what prompted a tacit extrapolation without an explicitly ver­
balized justification. Most likely, it was an overriding desire of having and 
obtaining a truly fundamental theory. It became an article of faith! The 
confidence in this article of faith was indirectly reinforced.
The new QM methods, for instance, confirmed the selection rules, the 
zero-point energy and the quantum number Vn(n+1) for angular momen­
tum gave a better spectral fit in the formula of the Lande spin-orbit 
coupling. Yet almost all, if not all, textbooks fail to mention how Planck,3 
more than a decade earlier, had already introduced zero-point energy as an 
ensemble property. In section 5 of this chapter, it is shown how the quan­
tum number Vn(n+1) also permits an ensemble connotation.^
The validity of extrapolating these ensemble features to single systems 
by the Copenhagen view was unlikely to be contradicted as long as single­
system observations remained experimentally rare events. The spectacular 
experiments of Dehmelt and coworkers finally isolated the single particle. 
In section 9 of chapter XI, options are discussed for the isolated point-elec­
tron with "Zitterbewegung" and the isolated trefoil electron without zero­
point energy. On the basis of that testimony, the reader is invited to 
reassess Copenhagen's thesis of universal zero-point energy, regardless of 
whether or not a system or particle is part of an ensemble.
The physics community at large had its private reasons for hanging on 
to the new mystique of QM methodology. It helped to perpetuate the illu­
sion of having an all-encompassing theory. Even if the connotations of 
wider applicability were purely based on unproven faith, the truth was de­
ceptively masked by supportive asymptotics and the beautiful, rigorous, 
mathematical structure of Hilbert's spectral theory. So, notwithstanding 
the absence of a direct proof of single-system applicability, its viability in 
that realm became a cornerstone of Copenhagen's statistical interpretation.
The subsequent successes of the theory were so absolutely overwhelm­
ing that any need for further verification of its basic premises seemed un­
necessary. Dirac’s identification of particle spin and magnetic moment then 
enhanced a nearly absolute belief in a magical all around applicability. The 
epistemological objections of Einstein and Popper soon were forgotten, and 
so were the claims by Ballentine, Collins, Groenewold and others about en­
semble oriented implications of the function.
Yet, more glory was to come. An energy level of hydrogen, which, ac­
cording to the Dirac theory, had to be degenerate, was, in fact, found to be 
a doublet. A zero-point energy-based superstructure of QM, known as 
quantum electrodynamics (QED), has provided unique services for a 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
39
calculation of this doublet separation (Lamb shift). Measurement and 
calculation agreed over four decimal places, superimposed on a base level 
known to about five decimal places. Some preachers of the QED gospel 
cited the combined nine decimal places as an unparalleled precision in the 
history of physics. The same theory, for the first time, also accounted for 
the higher- order differences of the anomalous magnetic moments of the 
electron and muon.
With such abundance of measured and calculational precision, QED 
seemed to be an ideal candidate for making very accurate determinations of 
Planck's fundamental constant of action h and the elementary charge e. 
Yet dramatic fluctuations in recommended h and e values, published^ 
during the decades between 1950 and 1980 and collected in Table I of 
chapter VIII, proved otherwise. Here was testimony that something was 
not yet right.
When, during the Eighties, combined Josephson- and quantum Hall ef­
fect measurements gave reproducible h and e values over 7 to 8 decimal 
places, the QED data were found to have fluctuated in the fourth decimal 
place between 1950 and 1980. The selection of numbers in Table I is 
again cited for comparison. Notwithstanding QED's tremendous services in 
better understanding the Lamb shift and electron muon anomalies, its h and 
e values still were reminders that QED had not arrived yet.
While the numbers of Table I testify to difficulties within QED itself, 
there has been little inclination to rectify the situation by going back all the 
way to the premises of QM as the mother discipline of QED. The Popper 
ensemble option of QM does not relate well to QED, because the latter is 
strongly dependent on Copenhagen premises. Here is the very reason why 
it is so difficult to give up Copenhagen, notwithstanding the misgivings that 
even its most faithful supporters must have about its basic premises. The 
truth of the matter is that while the Popper alternative has fewer unproven 
premises of faith, it upsets the apple cart by requiring a totally different 
QED approach. This challenge has to be met squarely if the Popper initia­
tive is to give at least a perspective on a possibility of competing with stan­
dard QED results. Attempts in this direction have been made in chapters 
VIII;2 and XI;7,9. Without at least this glimpse of a perspective on QED 
alternatives, the chances for Popper's initiative to win out over Copenhagen 
would be, if not hopeless, bleak indeed.
Here we have at least some rationale why so many eloquent efforts of 
the past have failed. The present motivation for reopening these issues to 
further scrutiny has found much encouragement in some important new 
experimental results that have recently become available. Mindful that past 
articles of faith cannot always be lifted to the level of rational truth, let us 
go to work to see what else needs to be changed.

40
CHAPTER III
3. Single Particle Diffraction
For a long time, diffraction phenomena were regarded as typical wave 
manifestations. By the end of the 19th century, Huygens principle, Young 
and Fresnel's experiments and last, but not least, Maxwell's theory of the 
electromagnetic field seemingly made the Newtonian particle picture of 
light quite unthinkable. In the beginning of the 20th century, the photo­
electric effect, and Einstein's explanation thereof, brought an unexpected 
change in this situation. Here was a resurrection of Newton's particle idea!
The development of X-ray technology subsequently revealed a particle 
nature of light. The Geiger-Mueller counter made it possible to register 
and count individual photon absorption events. The persistent reminders of 
particle connotations in phenomena believed to be wave-related, led to 
questions as to whether diffraction might also be describable as a particle 
manifestation by using extended first principles of mechanics.
In 1923, W. Duane^ confronted this very challenge. He succeeded in 
deriving a diffraction relation by imposing quantum conditions on 
Newton's collision treatment of light diffraction. The basic train of 
thoughts is as follows:
A particle of momentum p hits a reflecting surface under an angle of 
incidence 6. The Newtonian exchange of momentum is then
p = 2p cos e. 
1
Following Bragg, the wave description of diffraction can be accomplished 
without a need to call on quantization. The particle-based description, 
surprisingly, invokes quantization. It is one of those reminders that 
classical and nonclassical are much closer than we think. So, let us not 
exaggerate differences where Nature gives us an inkling of closeness. 
Duane assumed that particle collision could be governed by the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld condition:
fp-dq = nh; uuith n = 1,2,3,... 
2
The periodicity implied by this loop integral is provided by the lattice 
structure of the material surface hit by the particle. Let us assume that the 
surface of reflection coincides with the lattice surface of a single crystal 
with lattice spacing d, the integral Eq.2 written out with the help of Eq.l 
then becomes:
|p-dq = 2pd cos© = nh, 
3
A comparison between the particle diffraction formula Eq.3 and Bragg's 
wave diffraction formula is now indicated.

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
41
For a lattice distance d, irradiation with wave length A and lattice 
surface incidence angle 0, Bragg's formula is
2d cos 9 = n A ; also with n=l,2,3,... 
4
A comparison between Duane's particle formula Eq.3 and Bragg's wave 
formula Eq.4 yields as condition for identification:
p = h/A . 
5
Eq.5 is recognized as de Broglie's famous relation between particle 
momentum p and wavelength A.
Historically and quite independently of one another, Duane and de 
Broglie proposed the relation Eq.5 in the same year 1923. Their motiva­
tions though were just about diametrically opposite.
De Broglie, intrigued by the relativistic relation between the frequency­
wave vector {co,k} and the energy-momentum vector {E,p}, extended the 
Planck-Einstein relation E=ti co to the spatial domain, thus leading to the 
vector relation p = tik with b = h/2rr. This procedure inspired him to 
look for a wave aspect of particles with rest-mass.
By contrast, Duane sought to establish a zero rest-mass particle aspect of 
hard X-rays, because that is what X-ray experimentation seemed to call 
for. Interestingly, de Broglie's proposition for rest-mass particles was 
strikingly confirmed a few years later by Davisson-Germer. Their work 
was unrelated to de Broglie's hypothesis; they were investigating the 
surface structure of crystals by bouncing slow electrons from single-crystal 
metals. They found, as a side effect, the angle preference according to 
Eqs.3 and 5. Fresnel's premature wave triumph thus had turned into a 
veritable wave-particle duality.
Using coincidence counting, it has been possible in recent time to do 
diffraction experiment with single particles. Aspect? et al have done so 
with photons and Rauch^ et al with neutrons. It has been found that a 
single particle does not seem to divide itself to follow its diffraction op­
tions; it does so all by itself and knows exactly where to go once the option 
choice has been made. A wave analysis cannot quite account for this 
behavior, yet the particle analysis given by Duane, using Bohr-Sommerfeld 
conditions, indeed accounts for these findings. He really anticipated this 
behavior on the grounds of the, at that time, observed behavior with very 
low intensity X-ray beams. The Aspect-Rauch experiments thus brought 
home the particle-wave duality with a renewed intensity.
One of the conclusions emerging from the here cited results is certainly 
that diffraction phenomena are not to be taken as unambiguous evidence 
for the presence of waves. Conversely, in the spirit of Hamilton's "eikonal" 
analysis, waves can be expected to have particle-like manifestations, if only 
in the limiting case of a geometric-optic approximation. Since, in a wave 

42
CHAPTER III
sense, diffraction can only come about through wave interference, waves 
were always taken to be a sine qua non for diffraction.
This point no longer holds if we give Duane's analysis a measure of 
relevance. It also means the particle-wave duality stops being effective if 
we try to represent one particle by a wave. The conclusion stands to reason 
if we consider that waves have, by nature, a plurality connotation; single 
particles don't because unlike waves they cannot be divided. Hence, we can 
at best speak of a wave-many particle duality.
The birth of the new quantum mechanics a few years later, never gave 
Duane's position a chance to come out of the woodwork. The particle 
diffraction exhibited by earlier experimentation, prior to Aspect and 
Rauch, had always involved a large number of particles (e.g., Davisson- 
Germer and Debye-Scherrer, Thomson).
The transcription used by Schroedinger to obtain his wave equation was 
indeed a single-particle-* wave transcription. The ensuing full duality con­
jecture between wave and single particle was understandable; it was not a 
necessary consequence. Later there have been derivations of the 
Schroedinger equation using ensembles of many identical, similarly pre­
pared systems. Hence, full duality between wave and many "single parti­
cles" became a feasible proposition.
A single system with many particles (and ensembles thereof) leads to a 
confrontation with the more than two body problem, which, in QM, is as 
intractable as in celestial mechanics. From the QM angle in the Popper per­
spective, there is an added complication. Order rules inside the many-par- 
ticle systems, yet phase and orientation disorder rules on the outside 
between these systems as constituents of an ensemble. The mystery of the 
Schroedinger process is certainly its dual capability of effectively dealing 
simultaneously with internal system order and outside ensemble disorder.
A qualitative understanding of the spectra of more body systems has 
been enhanced by the consideration of structural symmetry principles. 
Their group description and their relation to a subsequent lifting of the de­
generacy in energy levels has much enhanced spectral understanding. Yet, 
an alien principle has to enter the scene to create order in the over-abun­
dance of possible solutions of the many-particle Schroedinger equation. 
The Pauli principle assumes this role; it helps in making the distinctions be­
tween fermion and boson particles. Berry 9 et al have opened up new 
horizons for model-based order principles in atomic structure. By pro­
moting a global-oriented idea of collective particle behavior, they have 
been introducing principles of a kinematic, topological flavor.
Although electron spin has a major role in implementing the Pauli 
principle, the Dirac procedure, so successful in preparing the one-particle 
Schroedinger equation for spin description, has sadly failed in the case of 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
43
the many-particle Schroedinger equation. Even in the single-particle case, 
we become acquainted with many different species of functions: instead 
of one component scalar functions, there are now vector and spinor type 
wave functions. The relation of the latter to statistics is much less transpar­
ent than in the case of a scalar ty.
Suppose that the Schroedinger equation and its Dirac and many particle 
offshoots, all claiming their characteristic domains of relevance, are really 
ensemble description tools in disguise. How do their functions, as all- 
encompassing local-global tools, manage to selectively perform that double 
assignment of simultaneously describing the system's inner order and outer 
ensemble statistics of mutual system interaction?
This, in a nutshell, is a crucial question, with which the Copenhagen 
proponents might successfully stump their ensemble brethren. A partial 
yet conspicuous answer appears in section 6 of this chapter. For the two- 
dimensional harmonic oscillator, the condition of single-valuedness 
alone gives E = rThoo, without zero-point energy. Square integrability of tp, 
by contrast, emerges as the key to zero-point energy: n-*n + l/2. The latter 
may, by now, be accepted as a typical ensemble feature.
It really should have been incumbent on those who have elevated the 
Schroedinger equation and its offshoots to the position of a gift from 
heaven to identify in more detail what their function options are all 
about!
It has been customary to demand from those who are trying out alterna­
tives to reconfirm Copenhagen's preconceived premises, because they have 
worked so well. Imposing such conditions has become somewhat an 
automatic establishment reaction. Demands of this nature are not quite fair. 
Here is evidence of the function's verified double purpose; gives 
information "in the small" as well as "in the large."
Confronted with the here depicted state of affairs, modem physics' 
attitude has been somewhat less than candid. It has been recommending 
near-absolute faith in the rules of modem quantum mechanics, knowing 
full well that the asymptotics between Schroedinger and Bohr-Sommerfeld 
methods can mask alternatives of interpretation. Specifically in question is 
the conceptual incongruence of describing a single particle with the plural­
ity tool of waves. Closing the eyes for this incongruence is, at best, a tem­
porarily permissible act of strict pragmatism, until new facts and logic 
command a reassessment of the situation.
At this point, the choice is ours: either we add to the receptacle of 
nonclassical enigmas, or we give Duane's wave-*particle alternative a little 
more of a new lease on life.

4. Dipping below Heisenberg Uncertainty
An interesting series of optical processing experiments has been per­
formed recently with light beams. Using a technique of beam-splitting and 
trading phase noise against amplitude noise, one eventually ends up with a 
beam component in which, in terms of the field version of uncertainty, the 
noise has been "squeezed" below the Heisenberg level. 10
The originators of these squeezing procedures hasten to mention that 
for any component below the Heisenberg limit, there is an accompanying 
component correspondingly above that limit. Hence, for the combined 
components, with or without the artifact of squeezing, the Heisenberg limit 
remains intact.
The squeezers use a familiar approach in contemporary physics. They 
have one phrase to catch the attention, intimating some law might be 
violated. Then, once they have the attention, they follow up with a 
soothing declaration that all physical laws remain intact. To clarify this 
capitalizing on an apparent contradiction we need to ask: how does particle 
uncertainty transcribe into wave language and vice versa?
Since the wave concept has an inherent plurality connotation, the 
Heisenberg uncertainty for fields has automatically assumed an ensemble 
connotation. Hence, a conceptually meaningful equivalence between wave­
field uncertainty and particle uncertainty necessarily gives particle 
uncertainty a plurality connotation. The latter conclusion, though, is at 
variance with the Copenhagen view of quantum mechanical uncertainty. 
The contradiction is obviously resolved by assigning an ensemble status to 
the Schroedinger solutions. We then have ensembles on either side of the 
wave-particle duality.
Having established an ensemble status for the optical wave field and its 
associated wave uncertainty, we now need to ask: what does the process of 
squeezing do to the optical wave field and its uncertainty-implied 
randomness? Squeezing presumably affects the state of randomness of the 
optical ensembles here considered. Once an ensemble makes a transition 
from disorder to order, a dipping below the Heisenberg level of 
uncertainty does not violate any law, all of which obviates the need to apol­
ogize for such behavior.
In assessing this situation, we fortunately did not need to delve into the 
details of QED derivations used in the theory of squeezed states. The end 
result of a component below Heisenberg uncertainty will do. The simple 
application of true wave-particle duality indicates already that Heisenberg 
uncertainty does not have to be obeyed by single particles. In other words, 
Heisenberg uncertainty is at best an ensemble property. It then 
follows, the Schroedinger equation from which Heisenberg uncertainty 
obtains must be an ensemble tool.

5. Zero-Point Statistics of the "Copenhagen" Ensemble
The dictionary definition of the word "ensemble" in chapter I still can 
guide us with disordered zero-point ensembles, for which I propose the 
name "Copenhagen" or "Schroedinger" ensemble. Since disordered 
ensembles are susceptible to Schroedinger treatments, the zero-point 
energy hoo/Z per harmonic oscillator is then known to emerge as an 
automatic byproduct of the method. In the spirit of the ensemble 
interpretation, >100/2 is the energy average per harmonic oscillator of a 
phase randomized ensemble at absolute zero. There is no implication 
whatsoever that some oscillators or all oscillators must be assumed to have 
a mystery level of half a quantum of energy tioo/2.
The individual oscillators, when regarded as isolated entities, have an 
energy spectrum nboo with n as an integer. The latter expression is 
derivable from the period integral approach, based on the idea that a single 
system is to be regarded as belonging in the category of ordered ensembles. 
Using this single-system result, the question may be asked whether zero­
point energy is a possible byproduct of ensemble disorder. Planck has 
shown exactly that. Yet, before we paraphrase his result we need to es­
tablish what constitutes ensemble disorder near the zero-point. The 
parameters need to be identified describing order-disorder transitions near 
the absolute zero.
If it is true that Schroedinger's equation describes an ensemble of 
systems instead of a single system, then it follows that we no longer need to 
go out of our way to find strange and unnatural functions for the statistical 
implications of the 4* function. Instead of having a single particle 
mysteriously hopping around in some sort of a lonely zero-point dance of 
isolation, the qx function statistics now may be associated with the mutual 
behavior of systems in an ensemble. The next question is: what is it in the 
mutual system behavior in the ensemble, that may be presumed to be 
subject to statistical fluctuations?
Since Born's 4* function statistics has no thermal connotations, the 
possible association with a zero-point phase change is an option to be 
considered. Similarly as for phase transitions at given finite temperatures, 
also near the zero-point phase transitions are known to take place. They 
usually relate to the creation and/or annihilation of new degrees of 
freedom, say comparable to order-disorder transitions associated with 
melting and evaporation at higher temperature. During these order-dis­
order phase transitions, the temperature is known to remain constant, thus 
lending a nonthermal quality to the process.
It is reasonable to conceive of similar order/disorder phase transitions 
taking place for the low temperature cooperative effects, placing them in a 

46
CHAPTER IM
category associated with a gradual (ensemble-* single system) demise of the 
function statistics.
Consider hereto an ensemble of identical dynamical systems, and let us 
inquire: what ensemble parameters don't play a role in the thermal 
performance of such an ensemble? As possible candidates belonging to this 
category, one may consider the earlier-mentioned mutual phases of the 
dynamical systems and their mutual orientations. At this point, we should 
become aware of the nonlocal quality of mutual phase and orientation. It 
means they are not to be considered as local parameters characteristic of 
individual constituent systems of the ensemble. The importance of this 
observation is that the nonlocal parameter-quality of mutual phase and 
orientation permit us to steer clear of local hidden variable theory and its 
Nemesis known as Bell's inequality.
After this long-winded introduction, which was necessary to delineate 
the situation with respect to contemporary theory, we may now be willing 
to go back in time and see how Planck^ has led the way in exploring this 
nonthermal or pre-thermal statistics in physics. Let us consider an 
ensemble of Planck's favorite harmonic oscillators. They are all identical 
with inertia m and stiffness k. Each has an energy
E = (1/2m)p2 + (1/2)kq2 
6
where p = mq is the momentum and q is the amplitude. Eq.6 gives the en­
ergy per oscillator with q and p varying between oscillators. If go = -^k/m 
is the frequency, q= maximum amplitude and <t>=phase is, the q,p solutions
are:
7
8
9
q = q sinfcot + <t>) ; p = comq cos(cot + 4>).
Substitution of Eq.7 into Eq.6 yields 
E = (1/2) kq2.
A phase space average for the ensemble is given by 
fjMpdq 
Ijdpdq ■
The evaluation of Eq.9 is greatly simplified by making the transformation 
of variables (p;q)—*(q;4>). The Jacobian J of this transformation is:
J = mqoo . 
10
An evaluation of Eq.9 for q between the limits q n and q p and for 4> the 
phase averaging from 0 to 2k, now gives for the energy average:
Aii4~c|i4
<E> = (k/4) j^^^k/4) (qn2^!2)
11
No quantization has so far been introduced; following Planck, we shall 
now assume that the q limit II corresponds to a quantum state n+1, and the 
q limit I corresponds to a quantum state n, Eq.8 then gives

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
47
En = (1/2) kqn2 = (n+1)hco, 
12a
Ej = (1/2) kq:2 = iThco . 
12b
A little bit of algebra between Eqs. 11 and 12 gives the familiar relation
<E> = En=(n + 1/2) boo 
13
as an ensemble average for harmonic oscillators for the states n and n+1.
The result of Eq. 13 is not all that surprising; one would expect an end 
result between n and n+1. The interesting part is whether or not the 
ensemble average can become zero, because n=0 gives a residual energy 
tico/2 per oscillator.
At this point, Planck goes a crucial step further. Starting from the 
premise that a probability is by nature a positive quantity, he shows that 
without this residual energy there can be no "thermodynamic" or statistical 
equilibrium for the ensemble.
Here is a condensed version of Planck's argument. Let Nn be the 
number of oscillators in the statistical energy state En denoted by Eq. 13. 
The total energy E of the ensemble is then
E = £NnEn
Let N be the total number of oscillators. In a state of equilibrium the 
number
wn = Nn/N
may then be regarded as the probability of an oscillator to be in the state n, 
and so it obeys the sum rule
£wn = 1.
Now multiplying Eq. 13 by Nn and summing over n gives, after using the 
above three relations, the result;
N^nuJn = E-N hco/2.
Since n>0 and Wn>0, it follows that E/N > 1iao/2, q.e.d.. Planck 
optimizes the entropy and also calculates the "phase" distribution law, he 
thus proves wn to be positive (see p.141 of ref.3).
All things being equal, it has to be said that Planck's zero-point energy 
■hco/2 is clearly cause-related and thoroughly thought through, unlike the 
"surprise" zero-point energy >100/2 that comes out of the Schroedinger 
equation.
The Schroedinger boo/2 is a surprise gift from nature, which was 
produced by an equation which, as Schroedinger basically did admit, came 
as a gift from heaven. We don't know quite what that equation means, 
unless we are willing to experiment and accept, as potential work 
hypothesis, that a use of the Schroedinger equation tacitly invokes an 
ensemble situation.

48
CHAPTER III
An inspection of the contemporary textbook literature on quantum 
mechanics reveals not a word about Planck's zero-point work, which in­
cidentally preceded the 1925 quantum revolution by more than a decade. 
The mathematical machinery of the Schroedinger process automatically 
gives the result, just by turning the eigenvalue crank. This process, it needs 
to be said, does not invite much further thought about the physics.
Let us now examine the ensemble origin of the Schroedinger angular 
momentum state Vn(n+l)h as compared to the nb states of the quantum 
era prior to 1925; the latter also equates to Schroedinger's fixed axis result. 
Assuming random orientation of an ensemble in the nth quantum state, the 
discrete "observable" quantum projections in a given direction x are the 
/13-4-1
-n,-(n-l),-(n-2),.. -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, (n-2), (n-l),n 
14
For a total of N systems and near-perfect ensemble randomness, each state 
can be expected to be filled by N/(2n+l) systems. Since the total angular 
momentum L of a perfectly random ensemble can be expected to vanish, it 
will be more interesting to inquire about the square of the modulus of L. 
Hence
IL|2=(Lx)2+(Ly)2+(Lz)2 . 
15
For each of the components one can write
(Lx)2 = 2(12+22+32+..............(n-l)2+n2)b2 N/(2n+l). 
16
The series sum is given by the formula:
P+22+32+..........n2 = (2n+l)n(n+l)/6. 
17
Substitution of Eq. 17 in Eq. 16 and then in turn in Eq. 15, when considering 
that perfect randomness gives isotropy (Lx)2=(Ly)2 =(LZ)2, one obtains as 
average angular momentum modulus per system
ILI/N = b 7 nfnTfi, 
18
which is the result predicted by the Schroedinger equation.
Unlike the Planck result on zero-point energy, which seems to be 
missing from all contemporary textbooks on quantum mechanics, the result 
of Eq. 18 is only "almost" missing from the contemporary literature.
There are two exceptions! The Feynman Lectures^ give a derivation of 
Eq. 18, and so does a book by Kompaneyets.4 In both cases, Eq. 18 is 
presented as an interesting oddity, as something to think about. There is no 
attempt at assessing its meaning in the context of the prevailing Copenhagen 
interpretation. Since an orientational averaging procedure has been used, 
there has to be some sort of an ensemble. What is that ensemble?
Reading the two presentations, one has to guess as to what type of an 
ensemble is being implied. The only ensemble compatible with the 
Copenhagen interpretation would be an ensemble in the sense of Gibbs, 
which invokes an ensemble of conceivable manifestations of one and the 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
49
same single system. At this point, one should be made aware of the 
difference. The actual physical ensemble can accommodate an interaction 
of its constituents; the Gibbs ensemble cannot, because there is only one 
physical system that is being considered. The Gibbs ensemble, therefore, is 
poorly suited to account for a description of order/disorder transitions that 
can take place in the actual physical ensemble.
An inquiry is now appropriate into the ensemble awareness of the early 
authors who initiated modem quantum mechanics. True to the epistemo­
logical tenor of his thinking, HeisenbergH made the use of "observables" a 
centerpiece of his approach. While, without question Heisenberg's observ­
ables were ensemble-based, his subsequent involvement with the Copen­
hagen view testifies to an omission of epistemological rigor on his part.
By contrast, Schroedinger^ does not fail to relate the residual tiaj/2 
to Nernst’s law and Planck's zero-point energy. Since, at the time, 
Schroedinger himself had ventured a single system "smeared out" particle 
picture, the ensuing dichotomy with Planck's zero-point ensemble may 
have played a part in his subsequent adamant opposition to the Copenhagen 
interpretation. Yet it is not known whether Schroedinger ever openly 
joined the small club of ensemble supporters. Perhaps also in this realm, 
he knew too well the limitations of his own creation.
6. The Enigma of the Missing Flux Residue
Standard Copenhagen-based folklore has it that zero-point energy may 
be extrapolated to have meaning as a single particle- or as a single system 
manifestation. Yet a close examination of the experimental results of flux 
quantization in superconducting rings does not quite support the legitimacy 
of that act of extrapolation. In fact, there is no flux residue that could con­
ceivably correspond to a zero-point energy in what should be regarded as 
an ordered (i.e., single system) electron motion in the superconducting 
ring. Hence, either the extrapolation is impermissible, or there is still a 
Schroedinger-based argument to account for this absence of a correspond­
ing zero-point flux.
Initial difficulties in conceiving of a Schroedinger-type harmonic mo­
tion without zero-point energy, led to a premature conviction of having 
stumbled on a full-fledged argument against a single-system extrapolation 
of Schroedinger results. Arguing along these lines with people, to give up 
their faith in this Copenhagen article of faith, met with a persistent under­
tone of opposition. A new insight, though, emerged from a conversation 
with N. Bloembergen.
Closer scrutiny revealed indeed an harmonic motion in the 
Schroedinger sense that does not display a zero-point energy. The super­
conducting ring is a case in point. Hence the question of a generally per­

50
CHAPTER III
missible extrapolation of zero-point energy to single systems still remained 
unresolved. The inquiry revealed, however, a curious relation between ra­
dial variable and zero-point energy. Here are some details of these 
proceedings (chapterVI;l).
If a single oscillator, or the cooperative equivalent thereof, can be found 
that permits a check whether or not Schroedinger's zero-point energy state 
can exist in an isolated system, a long-awaited answer to quantum mechani­
cal interpretation would be in sight. Once matters are examined in the here 
delineated perspective, it is found that an experiment of just about this kind 
was "almost" performed, some thirty years ago; yet it was never con­
sidered in this light. I refer here to the discovery of flux quantization in 
superconducting rings.13 The BCS electron pairs, circulating in the ring, 
provide an ideal example of cooperative harmonic motion.
The electron pairs are taken to constitute an ensemble with perfect phase 
and orientation order. Since electrons are moving here in the magnetic 
field generated by their own motion, one could say: one half of the circu­
lating electrons is performing a cyclotron oo = (e/m)B/2 motion in the field 
generated by the other half, which is one-half of the actually observed 
field B. Hence, with respect to the observed field, the cyclotron motion is 
perceived as a Larmor circulation: co = (e/2m)B.
Having thus established an apparent cyclotron aspect of the situation, 
one may now consider applying Landau's^ solution of the Schroedinger 
equation for the cyclotron motion. Since this analysis assumes a 
Schroedinger applicability to this single system situation, it may be consid­
ered as a potential test case (i.e., if the given Larmor-* cyclotron transition 
is acceptable). Landau's analysis leads to the familiar energy spectrum of 
the form given by Eq. 13, and leaves for n = 0 an always present zero-point 
energy tioo/2. It is hard to conceive of such a zero-point motion without 
exhibiting a corresponding always present flux residue of h/4e.
Let us now closely examine the experimental results on the presence of 
such a flux residue. Fig.l gives a reproduction of the experimental results 
of Deaver-Fairbank. 11 It seems fair to say that these data show little or no 
evidence for the presence of a residual flux h/4e. Hence no zero-point 
level is suggested. Therefore, by calling at this point bluntly on the Landau 
result as having a finite zero-point level, there would seem to be a contra­
diction between theory and experiment.
In view of the importance of this apparent contradiction, the earlier 
mentioned discussion with N. Bloembergen made it well advised to go 
through the Landau argument to verify whether or not the superconducting 
ring is truly physically comparable with the external B field situation envi­
sioned by Landau.

ing to Deaver and Fairbank (ref.l 1). The ordinate shows the trapped flux in MKS 
units h/2e as a function of the external field in which the cylindrical rings have 
been cooled below the transition temperature. Note absence of residual flux!
Before making that comparison, let us first have a look at the flux 
measurements of Deaver and Fairbank in Fig.l. They rather convincingly 
show the absence of a residual flux
It is now necessary (for the first time in these discussions) to write 
down explicitly the Schroedinger equation for an electron's planar motion 
in a magnetic field B derivable from a vector potential A. The A may be 
external, or it may be internally generated. If r and <t> are the position 

52
CHAPTER III
coordinates of radius and angle, the Schroedinger equation assumes the 
form:
3 
3 
1 32 
2mE-e2R2
r3r’'sr 
r2 34>2 
h2 
19
If the 4> dependence is taken to be physically inconsequential, the angle 
term cancels and Eq. 19 yields the ordinary differential equation:
Id d 2mE-e2R2
7d?rd7*- 
20
Following Landau, Eq.20 can be reduced to an Hermite type equation 
leading to a spectrum with residual zero-point energy:
E = (n+^)bco , (Eq.13) uuith co = eB/m. 
21
For the Larmor case of a superconducting ring, however, not only the 
<t> changes, also the r changes drop out, because the electrons are restrained 
to the fixed radius r of the ring. Even if trivial, a nonzero wave function
* 0 then yields for Eq. 19:
E= e2R2/2m uuith oo = eB/2m. 
22
This perfectly classical relation can be rewritten with the help of R = Br/2 
(which follows from Stokes' law) and yields
1 
1
E= -mr2co2 = - <bJ; uuith <b=flux and J = eco/27T. 
23
This degeneracy of Schroedinger's process invites here, if you will, an 
alternative where energy quantization ntioo is obtained by taken the flux­
quantization law as guiding principle. This approach is discussed in 
chapters VI and VII, but does not permit us to come to an explicit 
contradiction with Schroedinger's process as a potential tool applicable to 
ordered "nonensemble" situations (compare chapter XVI;3 for local-global 
features).
At this point, one may argue that ruling out the 0 dependence is a 
highhanded manner of disposing of the Schroedinger process. Let us 
therefore assume there is <|> periodicity without r dependence, a situation 
which reflects the physical reality of the superconducting ring. The 
condition of single valuedness for now leads to
2mE-e2R2 
h2r2
(2JT)2 n2 .
Using the appropriate transcriptions (compare hereto chapter VII; 4) 
this expresses a circular motion for which E= ntico without zero-point 
energy. It thus follows: The Schroedinger zero-point energy specifically 
relates to the r dependence.
The constant radius feature of the superconducting ring unfortunately 
does not lend itself to an acid test to conclude on the ensemble nature of 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
53
zero-point energy. However, the Schroedinger analysis does indicate how 
the condition of wave function single valuedness all by itself leaves out 
zero-point energy for the individual ensemble constituent, whereas wave 
function square integrability is identified as the actual source of the zero­
point phenomenon. It cannot be denied that the 0-»«» interval of the radial 
variable r has a potentially environmental connotation, which could invoke 
ensemble-associated behavior.
Whether or not the Schroedinger process applies to an isolated 
cyclotron state would be testable if it were possible to measure the 
cyclotron radius of a single cyclotron state. The boo/2 would have to 
show up in the radius r, because it can only show up in the kinetic energy 
(l/2)mr2co2 of an electron, which is circulating with the fixed cyclotron 
frequency co = e B / m. For a clearly observable distinction between n and 
n+1/2, n would have to be small, preferably 0 or 1. Yet, an explicit 
observation of the radius r, without changing r, categorizes such an 
experiment as a quantum nondemolition measurement.
Most quantum measurements are contingent on a transition between 
quantum states. Direct observation of quantum states is rare, except for the 
more recent macro-quantum effects such as flux quantization and quantum 
Hall effects.
7. 
Uncertainty and Zero-point Energy
The principle of uncertainty has been almost right from the start one of 
the very conspicuous features of modem quantum mechanics. From the 
philosophical point of view, it has also been the source of an immense 
literature about its knowledge-theoretical aspects. Questions converge on 
limiting the role of causality in physics. Yet from the pragmatic angle, 
uncertainty is one of the least essential features for the practical application 
of quantum mechanics.
Uncertainty originally was introduced by Heisenberg 15 with the help of 
a thought experiment in the microphysical realm. It was only a little later 
when Kennard 16 and WeyU^ showed how the Heisenberg result could be 
derived from the Schroedinger equation. It was this derivation which may 
have had a crucial role for the inception of the Copenhagen interpretation, 
because the process is based on premises that hold a strong position in the 
Copenhagen scheme of things. The basic ingredients of the Kennard and 
Weyl derivations are the theorems of normal mode expansion and a prob­
ability premise for normalized wave-function solutions of the Schroedinger 
equation.
Since the Schroedinger equation is a generator of normal mode solu­
tions, quantum physics sort of naturally relates to the spectrum of infinite 
series expansions. Using the pseudo-geometric language of the times, it was 

54
CHAPTER III
said that the spectral theory of Hilbert spaces had become quantum mechan­
ics' major tool of analysis. The theory of infinite series expansions was not 
merely a field of endeavor of pure mathematics; it also had a fundamental 
role in applied mathematics. For practical reasons infinite expansions were 
sometimes truncated to finite expansions; in doing so, a criterion of preci­
sion was needed to give an idea how many terms would be adequate for a 
desired result. For a continuous expansion, an integral truncation would 
suffice to produce the desired precision.
For many years, such a criterion has been known for the Fourier ex­
pansions. It says
dktfqssl, 
24
where <5q denotes a position uncertainty corresponding to a conjugate un­
certainty <5k, which is a measure of the inverse wave length (wave number) 
error introduced by breaking off the expansion.
The origin of this precision criterion may go back to Abbe's investiga­
tions on the diffraction limitations of optical instruments. The resolving 
power of a microscope is essentially based on a relation of this kind. Eq.24 
can be given this more physics-oriented appearance by considering the 
resolution limit of a microscope. The underlying rationale boils down to 
the fact that (without special measures such as scanning) the precision of an 
optical instrument is limited by its aperture R (of the numerical order 1) 
and the wavelength A of the light being used for the observation, through 
an expression of the form: <5q > A/R. Since A = 2-n7k is the "shortest" 
wavelength involved in the process of measurement, A and k assume the 
role of <5 A and <5k in the sense of Eq.24. It is also known that Norbert 
Wiener discussed this criterion in a Goettingen seminar, prior to 
Heisenberg's introduction of quantum uncertainty as a universal notion.
It has intrigued generations of physicists that multiplication of Eq.24 by 
h produces the Heisenberg relation, by virtue of de Broglie's h<5'k = <5p. A 
precision criterion translates here into an optimum expectation, or worse, 
the relation thus assumes the familiar Heisenberg form
tfptfq^'h, 
25
which has now been given a physical significance transcending that of a 
precision criterion. Eq.25 has been a source of interminable disputes. Since 
Heisenberg's original approach was not based on the use of the already ex­
isting wave function concept, his derivation was for all practical purposes a 
physical translation of a Fourier-Wiener type precision criterion.
Now what was Heisenberg's ingenious rationale for translating the 
Fourier-Wiener precision criterion into a momentum position-uncertainty 
criterion? A matter of mathematical choice of precision was hereby trans­
formed into a dictate of physics. It is normally argued that the process of 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
55
measurement would be essentially a collision process of a photon and the 
particle under consideration: a Compton effect if you will. So multiplica­
tion of Eq.24 by b to obtain Eq. 25 is calling on de Broglie's relation, and 
is justified by the Compton effect. The observation thus affects the object 
being observed, which is a basic premise of measurement theory.
It follows from this overview of physics of the Twenties that the 
Heisenberg rationale clearly was contingent on the single-system premise of 
contemporary orthodox quantum mechanics. It was this point of view that 
later was to be consolidated in what is now known as the Copenhagen in­
terpretation.
The ensuing big question now is: if the Copenhagen single-system inter­
pretation is no longer a permissible picture for the physical situation de­
scribed by the Schroedinger equation, then what happens to the uncertainty, 
and what happens to measurement theory? Clearly, some reorganizing will 
be necessary, if the Copenhagen single-system view is replaced by an en­
semble of constituents random in phase and orientation. A reading of en­
semble-based quantum texts (e.g., Kemble^) reveals how the ensemble 
point of view merely tends to avoid traditional uncertainty. The issues now 
can be met head-on, to bring them in a more definitive light.
If the Copenhagen view is no longer an acceptable physical identifica­
tion for the Schroedinger equation, the Heisenberg picture of an always 
present primordial single-system physical uncertainty will have to be aban­
doned. Yet, as shown by Kennard and Weyl, a Heisenberg-type of uncer­
tainty relation is an unavoidable consequence of the Schroedinger equation, 
in conjunction with a probability connotation of the wave function. 
Adopting, as before, the basic premise of retaining the Schroedinger equa­
tion, while rejecting the Copenhagen single system position, uncertainty, as 
given by Kennard and Weyl, now has to be related to the phase-and-direc- 
tion randomized ensemble replacing the Copenhagen single-system view.
Hence, rather than taking the single-system premise of measurement 
theory, the ensemble invites a rather more natural view of uncertainty (or 
indeterminacy) as a manifestation of a zero-point randomness of the phase 
and orientation of the ensemble constituents. The ensemble picture thus 
pulls the rug from under a leading premise of measurement theory.
The long suspected relation between uncertainty and zero-point motion 
thus becomes a theoretically more acceptable proposition. The Copenhagen 
single-system primordial uncertainty and the single-system primordial 
zero-point motion hereby are given a common ensemble basis.
A most instructive discussion of the generic perspectives of uncertainty, 
in the context of Popper's ensemble proposition and the Einstein, Rosen, 
Podolsky-type thought experimentation, can be found in Jammer's book.2

8. 
Planck's Zero-point Ensemble
The sum and total of the here collected diversity of evidence has an in­
escapable physical message. It is nothing less than a collective testimony 
inviting an interpretational change of heart vis-a-vis the solutions of the 
Schroedinger equation. No longer can it be assumed that these solutions 
describe truly isolated single systems. No longer can it be assumed that 
these single systems are affected by an ever-present quantum mechanical 
uncertainty in the sense of Heisenberg. No longer can it be taken for 
granted that individual harmonic oscillators have a lowest energy state 
boo/2 dictated by the Schroedinger equation as well as by the procedure of 
matrix mechanics.
The new picture taking the place of the Copenhagen interpretation of 
single systems is, instead, some sort of an ensemble of single systems as 
first advocated with eloquent conviction by Popper, as early as 1934. Yet 
this Popper ensemble is not just any old ensemble, there are more surprises 
in store. They go back even to before the 1925 quantum revolution.
In 1912, Planck introduced what might be called a zero-point ensemble. 
As summarized in section 5, he averaged an ensemble of phase-randomized 
harmonic oscillators and showed that thermodynamic equilibrium de­
manded an average zero-point energy of 1ico/2 per oscillator. Now, add 
to Planck's phase randomness of 1912 an orientational randomness of the 
ensemble constituents, and one finds how a Planck ensemble, so extended, 
manifests all the characteristic features that are obtained by solving the 
Schroedinger equation. Section 5 also shows how the Schroedinger quan­
tum number of angular momentum Vn(n+1) can be reproduced by spatial 
averaging. With all this concerted evidence pointing at a down-to-earth, 
Popper-type interpretation, physics had to decide on a mysteriously non- 
classical picture.
In the preceding sections we have effectively proven the following theo­
rem about the physical implications of Schroedinger's equation.
Theorem: The Schroedinger equation describes a zero-point ensemble 
of phase-and-direction randomized single systems, such as were originally 
introduced by Planck in 1912. The proof of this theorem is contingent on 
the assumption that the single-system constituents of this ensemble are 
described by the Bohr-Sommerfeld relations or global equivalents thereof.
There is an irony in the circumstance that Planck's zero-point ensemble 
of 1912 anticipated so many of the typical characteristic features that are 
described by the Schroedinger equation of 1926. It is rather amazing that 
the fact of Schroedinger's process reproducing Planck's ensemble-based 
zero-point energy was taken as proof of a single-system connotation of this 
process. There is no compelling logic for that conclusion. Yet the specific 
ensemble nature of Planck's zero-point energy is totally ignored in the 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
57
contemporary textbook literature. Why this reluctance to acknowledge 
Planck for that contribution?
What can now be said to justify the Copenhagen interpretation, with all 
its highly nonclassical ramifications? In the early years, just after the 
quantum revolution of 1925, physics was willing to buy some mystery in 
exchange for the wonderful tools that had become available. In 1934, 
physics was still too much in a state of euphoria to accept the down-to-earth 
criticism of Popper. Even with some measure of justification, physicists 
could say: we have to work with these new tools, let philosophy adapt itself 
to these new realities. Adaptations there were, causality and systems of 
logical inference were questioned. Yet the great eye-openers of new in­
sight were not quite forthcoming.
However, now that more evidence of the past and present is converging 
on a new reality, we do well keeping in mind that some of the more tradi­
tional procedures had not been exhausted. At the same time, awareness is 
building that some of the nonclassical Copenhagen metaphors were forced 
upon us without due process. In fact, closer inspection shows the absence 
of even an attempt at proof in a physical sense. There has been an ever in­
creasing string of abstractions (e.g. the point-particle) losing touch with 
physical realism. A proof of internal mathematical consistency is the best 
that Copenhagen can claim. To meet conditions of physical realism, inter­
nal consistency is necessary; it is not sufficient!
The here-given arguments lay serious reservations at the doorstep of 
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Its tacit extrapolation 
to single-systems never was and is also presently nowhere based on sound 
physical evidence. The amazing, and, in part, unbelievable aspect of this 
state of affairs is that the epistemological inadequacy of the Copenhagen 
view already was established in the Thirties. Hence, here is a standoff. 
There is no evidence conclusively justifying the Copenhagen single system 
extrapolation and neither is there conclusive evidence to rule out the single 
isolated system as carrier of an absolute always-present zero-point energy. 
The Schroedinger-based discussion of the superconducting ring in section 6 
falls just short of permitting that unambiguous conclusion.
In the meantime many textbooks have appeared suggesting a single­
system feature of zero-point energy. Many more instructors have told stu­
dents to digest what could not be digested. The single-system extrapolation 
of the Schroedinger process never was truly suspected as wanting, because 
it gave, almost all the time, asymptotically correct results. Yet, in recent 
times, there has been more of a half-way articulate undertone of having 
ensemble and single system both as viable options. To openly admit to 
having one's cake and eating it is a sympton of schizophrenia. Science may 
experiment with such dichotomy; it cannot be retained as a lasting feature.

58
CHAPTER III
Then, in the perspective of such weaknesses, what is it that has made the 
Copenhagen interpretation so intolerant of competing interpretations? 
Since it is certainly not a position of strength, it is weakness itself. The 
stature of the Copenhagen interpretation has risen above the people who 
put it together; it became independent of its originators?
Schroedinger himself was living proof of this process of depersonaliza­
tion. In no uncertain terms did he distance himself from the Copenhagen 
views. Hence, the people who put it together have not become deified, but 
a scattered patchwork of their ideas has. This final product then acquires 
an independent existence by assuming a near-religious stature.
Once ordinary mortals become the mediators of this divine inspiration, 
the work concerned becomes, in the course of time, to be regarded as a gift 
from heaven: e.g., the Schroedinger equation and perhaps, by association, 
also the Copenhagen interpretation. Yet the equation had no compelling 
derivation relating to experimental observation. Exactly this deficiency 
carried over into its interpretations. There were, at best, transcriptions 
from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of particle dynamics or the Euler equa­
tions of fluid dynamics. It hardly can be ignored; the stage was set to need 
and to accept a fair measure of religious faith to continue from that basis 
the pursuit of truth.
No matter what we do, faith always remains a critical element. Yet, also 
in science, there comes a time when faith needs to be tested. This faith 
needs to be rectified wherever it is not justified, and extended where such 
is needed to keep on going. The Copenhagen faith has run its course 
beyond the point where it can be helpful. By overextending its premises 
about quantum uncertainty, a fear has been created against making realistic 
spacetime models in the atomic and subatomic domain.
It is this attitude which has created the contemporary abstract pragma­
tism in physics as a method of last resort. In such theorizing one gropes for 
abstract calculational models, which tend to become mathematically top­
heavy. While there should be no objection against invoking such "abstract" 
methods, they should not lead to a premature discarding of procedures ap­
pealing to our visually oriented intuition.
There is presently an urgency to open up dialogues involving 
Copenhagen alternatives. It is not a good situation if alternatives, based on 
fewer and less-questionable premises, have to vie for consideration in 
opening up new avenues of exploration. The truth is: no matter how much 
beautiful mathematics we throw at the subject, Copenhagen, as commonly 
conceived, leads to a never-ending tinkering with logic and common sense.
Misner, Thome and Wheeler 19 jn their comprehensive treatise on 
gravity, give an extensive treatment of differential geometry, including the 
de Rham theorems on period integrals. Yet, when it comes to extrapolating 
these mathematical concepts to the microphysical domain, Copenhagen 

REASSESSING COPENHAGEN
59
stands in the way of their intuitive perceptions. They say: "The concept of 
spacetime is incompatible with the quantum principle." Further reading 
shows the words "quantum principle" as specifically referring to the 
"uncertainty principle" as the culprit depriving us of a deterministic as­
sessment. They use the words: "Spacetime does not exist, except in a classi­
cal approximation." Yet, the latter phrase would have deprived them of 
ever using the very de Rham theorems which they have so proudly placed 
on the pedestal they deserve. Starting with chapter VI, these theorems will 
be found to hold a physical key to a unique coexistence of discreteness in 
the realm of continuity.
Clearly, there is here a conflict situation of dramatic proportions. On 
the one hand, the authors (M,T,W) sense the very striking physical rele­
vance of the de Rham residue theorems, yet dominant Copenhagen philoso­
phy prevented them from taking full advantage of their own intuitive per­
ception. The nonclassical premise of an ever-present absolute quantum un­
certainty had blocked the way.
The currently prevailing nonclassical ideas of quantum 
uncertainty have physics conceptually boxed into a corner from 
which there is no escape.

Introduction
The mathematical concept of wave is a grosso modo idealization of col­
lective behavior of numerous "small" units meeting certain criteria of 
identity as particles. All wave equations of physics meet this asymptotic 
characterization, including the free-space d'Alembertian of electromag­
netism and the Schroedinger equation of matter-waves. The inherent plu­
rality connotation of wave(s) as a collective manifestation makes the wave­
particle duality an epistemological incompatibility, unless the particle is 
also given an appropriate plurality. This holds for E.M. wave versus pho­
tons as well as for matter-wave and leptons.
All so-called nonclassical features of modem physics ensue from an im­
permissible and unproven extrapolation from system plurality to single 
system. A plurality aspect of Heisenberg uncertainty can be inferred from 
the plurality nature of zero-point energy. The latter Planck introduced in 
1912, in a manner that led him to identify it as an ensemble manifestation, 
rather than as an a priori feature of all single systems.
Seen in this perspective, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum me­
chanics thus needs to make place for an ensemble, the single-system con­
stituents of which are described by the period integral extensions of an 
earlier Copenhagen tool created by Bohr-Sommerfeld.
2. 
Electrons versus Photons
The Schroedinger equation is a central and major tool of modem 
quantum mechanics. While it is one of the most productive and frequently 
used tools of contemporary physics, its origin is, by contrast, somewhat 
shrouded in mystery. The following is an attempt at separating mystery 
and fact in the light of some new experiences.
Quantum mechanics owes its current form to two daring leaps of imagi­
nation by de Broglie and Schroedinger. On grounds of spacetime invari­
ance, de Broglie postulated an extension of the Planck-Einstein energy-fre­
quency relation E = hoo into a full-fledged proportionality between energy­
momentum four-vector and frequency-wave four-vector:
(E;p) = ti(co;k).

COPENHAGEN VERSUS COPENHAGEN
61
Right from the start, Eq.l confronts us with a mathematical inconsis­
tency. When taken to describe a wave front, the vector (co,k) is bound to 
have the point association of a field vector. On the other hand, the vector 
(E,p) relates to the energy and momentum of an object occupying a finite 
domain of space. Hence, Eq.l is an invitation to add apples and oranges, a 
procedure that is known to be frowned upon. Declaring the particle to 
have a point existence is a way out of this predicament, and, as we know, 
that is just exactly how the Copenhagen interpretation resolves the 
inconsistency.
Physics can request dispensation from the apples-and-oranges rule, if, 
and only if, the results are unusually interesting. Eq.l has honored that 
promise beyond expectation. Yet the predicament stands, and sooner or 
later leads to confrontation. This inconsistency of point versus domain has 
just been identified as having paved the way for the point-electron. 
Interestingly, uncertainty reclaims for the point a finite physical presence 
by hopping around according to the dictates of Heisenberg. Mindful of 
these undeniable conceptual hurdles of standard theory, we do well by not 
being too literal about the subject matter and by having the word "wave" 
retain a metaphoric quality.
As a step following Eq.l comes Schroedinger's construction of a wave 
equation for these metaphoric waves implied by de Broglie's postulate. 
The equation so obtained specifically translates the diffracting influence of 
electromagnetic fields on the propagation behavior of the here-cited 
metaphoric waves; the latter are also known as "matter waves." Of course, 
the cited mathematical limitations of de Broglie's hypothesis unavoidably 
carry over into limitations for the Schroedinger and Dirac equations. The 
forced point-domain association invoked by Eq.l avoids what should have 
been a domain integration. In fact, as argued earlier in chapter III, Duane 
derives Eq.l from an integration!
Observational support for de Broglie's hypothesis is found in the 
specular reflection of electrons bouncing off single-crystal surfaces. 
Many experimentally confirmed calculations of quantum behavior can 
testify to an ample support for the wave metaphor, such as is embodied in 
Schroedinger's equation. They have been so numerous that a general 
interest in their detailed critical assessment has been waning. In view of 
these successes it is taken as a foregone conclusion that in borderline cases 
the theory gets the benefit of the doubt. New experiments invariably are 
expected to add confirmation to the viability of existing theory.
This remarkable interplay between hypothesis and fact has become the 
basis for what is known as "particle-wave duality." Since the key to deeper 
knowledge requires here a transition from particle to wave, there 
apparently is (in the spirit of the geometric optic approximation) a tacit 

CHAPTER IV
62
suggestion of waves being more fundamental than particles. In general, 
though, physics has been careful in avoiding such value judgments. 
Particles and waves are said to be complementary, in the sense that 
sometimes particle methods lead to answers; in other instances, waves do. 
The recommendation is: use either particle or wave, not both!
This complementarity of the two methods is illustrated by X-ray 
diffraction results. A wave description of the X-ray specular reflection is 
given by a formula due to Bragg. Yet, the reality of the photon hypothesis, 
as manifest in Geiger-counter observations, is so prevalent that it also truly 
invites an attempt at a particle description. Using, as shown by Duane J the 
Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions to obtain a discrete momentum exchange, the 
final result accounts indeed for the specular reflection. Comparison with 
the Bragg wave description then reproduces de Broglie's relation Eq.l for 
E.M. waves and photons, (chapter III;3)
Examining these two results, which simultaneously surfaced in the 
physics literature, we see how de Broglie hypothesizes his conclusion 
favoring a particle-* wave transition for particles with inertial mass. 
Duane, by contrast, derives his result from the Bohr-Sommerfeld condi­
tions and Bragg's relation; thus favoring a wave-* particle transition for sit­
uations involving photons.
The wave nature of X-rays as an electromagnetic phenomenon, in turn, 
prompts an inquiry into the wave nature of matter waves. The latter, when 
taken in the spirit of the Copenhagen interpretation, have no obvious 
intensity association; only normalized solutions of the Schroedinger 
equations are considered to relate to the physics. On the other hand, the 
intensity of electromagnetic waves have a definite physical connotation. 
Higher intensity conceivably indicates a higher "concentration" of photons. 
This prompts an inquiry whether an "intensity" of matter waves has been 
unjustifiably thrown out by normalization. Intensity could conceivably 
convey information about the concentration of ensemble elements asso­
ciated with those matter-waves.
Since the normalized wave functions of the Copenhagen interpretation 
does not permit this option of a variable concentration, the essence of 
system plurality has been sacrificed by the physically hard-to-define act of 
normalization. The normed function is said to be an "amplitude" for a 
probability of presence of a single particle as part of a system. The 
ensemble connotation of many of those systems is hereby negated.
If the Maxwell equations are taken to give a "wave metaphor" for pho­
tons, then the Schroedinger equations is taken to give a "wave metaphor" 
for electrons. While a plurality of photons is accepted as natural in elec­
tromagnetic situations, then, on what physically justifiable basis does the 
Copenhagen interpretation exclude, through wave function normalization, a 

COPENHAGEN VERSUS COPENHAGEN
63
plurality of electron systems as ensemble elements in the Schroedinger 
case? This question is at the root of a more precise exploration and speci­
fication of the realms of validity of the Schroedinger equation. The boson 
option of accumulation in the same quantum state naturally invites a notion 
of spatial boson density. The mutual exclusivity of fermions can only ac­
commodate a spatial density notion if the fermions become parts of boson 
structures.
3. Electromagnetic Wave (many) Photon Duality
As guidance for dealing with zero rest mass photons and nonzero rest 
mass leptons, a closer comparison of Maxwell and Schroedinger equations 
is necessary. Let us first examine how contemporary opinion deals with 
questions relating to particle-wave duality for zero rest mass situations.
The Maxwell equations proper don't have a wave connotation unless a 
constitutive behavior is postulated for the medium to which they are 
applied. The familiar MKS relations B=p0H and D=e0E are taken to pro­
vide precisely this constitutive information for matter-free space 
(i.e., when the latter is being examined from an inertial frame). The joint 
application of Maxwell laws and constitutive assumptions then leads to the 
familiar d'Alembertian as photon guidance equation. Let us list what is 
believed to be an accepted consensus for the d'Alembertian wave equation.
The d'Alembertian is primarily designed to be a wave equation, 
regardless of whether it is used for acoustic or for electromagnetic pur­
poses. The quantized photon and phonon aspects came after the wave 
connotation already had been firmly established. In fact, the d'Alembertian 
was created to accommodate waves, not anything else.
Photon and phonon aspects are manifest as soon as waves interact with 
the energy states of atomic and molecular matter. The ray trajectories of 
Hamilton's geometric optic solutions of the wave equation are, so far, the 
most eloquent testimony in support of a particle-wave duality. Yet, a con­
notation conveying an approximate nature of the geometric optic solution 
suggests waves as an item of greater fundamental importance than particles, 
without really adequate foundation. The inference of waves as more fun­
damental than particles is not to be regarded as a foregone conclusion. Its 
validity is tempered by constitutive postulates that go into the construction 
of wave equations.
Under these circumstances it is, at best, permissible to con­
clude that waves represent some sort of collective particle 
behavior. While geometric optic solutions of the wave equation reveal 
trajectories for particles, it stops just short of truly identifying particles. 
The latter are experimentally apparent only in the wave interaction with 
matter, such as is vividly illustrated by the modem techniques of photon 
counting.

64
CHAPTER IV
The quantum electrodynamic (QED) procedure of identifying a quan­
tum structure in an electrodynamic radiation field constitutes a normal 
mode decomposition of that radiation field. It assigns energy states 
(n+l/2)hoo to each individual normal mode. These quanta cannot directly 
be identified with a particle content of the radiation field, because the 
physical image of that object is in an unparticle-like fashion smeared out 
over all of space. It is impossible to understand, in this manner, how pho­
tons are locally absorbed or emitted.
The energy content of this decomposition diverges for an unlimited 
normal mode spectrum. The free-space constitutive assumptions leading to 
the d'Alembertian tacitly assume their validity from zero to infinite 
frequency. Specifications limiting constitutive validity in the interval 0-*°o 
are not readily available for the not generally recognized electromagnetic 
medium of matter-free space. In the light of these conceptual hurdles, the 
QED process can, at best, be regarded as a model for a calculational 
expedient, not as a model of physical reality.
The here-cited conditions do not support the idea of a d'Alembertian as 
a sole source of information for photon structure or single-photon 
behavior. Neither trajectory-based solutions nor solutions of the normal 
mode type have a clear photon connotation. As solutions of the same 
d'Alembertian, the wave as a plurality aspect of photon behavior hardly 
can be denied a measure of physical reality. Conversely, the model of a 
single particle as a superposition of neighboring trajectory waves fre­
quently is used as a possible image of particle identity in the guise of a 
wave packet. The latter suggests the epistemological oddity of a many­
waves versus single-particle duality.
The moral of this story centers around the identification of an epis­
temological error in the selection of comparable items in the duality as­
signment. There is no such thing as a single wave, yet elementary particle 
physics tells us that single particles are well defined. There is an indivisible 
particle unit connotation; Fourier analysis is living testimony that there is 
no such thing as a wave unit. Duality, as it is known in mathematics, re­
quires comparable numbers of descriptive parameters (e.g., point coordi­
nates versus line coordinates).
A Fourier decomposition of waves is a mathematical operation. Its 
component terms retain a subjective quality defying any reduction to any­
thing resembling a unit of wave. Any wave can be a finite or infinite 
superposition of other waves. Hence, wave and single particle don't really 
lend themselves well to a duality comparison. The mathematical abstrac­
tion called "wave" is an idealization in the sense of field theory.
As stated from the outset, the concept of wave, as known in physics, can 
at best be the result of a collective behavior of particles. The acoustic wave 

COPENHAGEN VERSUS COPENHAGEN
65
best represents the physical reality of that view. For the electromagnetic 
medium, we need to stretch our imagination, because the particles, being 
photons, are themselves carriers of visual messages. In the end, it is not the 
wave but the particle that is the more fundamental thing in nature. The 
term "wave" is, and will always be, a term describing collective behavior. 
Any other use violates the meaning as defined in the Oxford or Webster 
dictionaries. If physicists mean something else with their use of the word 
wave, they must come up with an unambiguous definition.
4. 
Matter Wave (many) Electron Duality
Let us now, for comparison, direct attention to how the particle-wave 
duality has developed around the Schroedinger wave equation, which has 
been developed for describing the behavior of rest-mass particles.
If, for the electromagnetic wave equation, the constitutive law is found 
to be the weakest link in its derivation, then, in the case of the 
Schroedinger equation, it should be Eq.l. Even so, there is not quite a 
derivation comparable to that of the d'Alembertian. There is, therefore, 
less of a chance of getting to the weak points of the train of thoughts that 
led to its implementation. If there are limitations on the use of the 
Schroedinger equation and the prevailing Copenhagen interpretation, they 
will have to be established in retrospect, because there is not quite a 
derivation from which these limitations can be clearly inferred. Instead, the 
whole gamut of ideas that was midwife to the inception of modem quantum 
mechanics needs to be reassessed.
The Schroedinger equation emerged from an inspired inquiry of what 
de Broglie's metaphoric matter-waves might do when subjected to an elec­
tromagnetic field. Schroedinger arrived at his equation in a two-step pro­
cess. First, he obtained an equation describing the stationary states of a 
system as eigenvalues of a multi-resonance system. The mathematical 
techniques proved to be very similar to what already was known for 
acoustic and electromagnetic resonance systems. After experiencing some 
initial difficulties, he then succeeded in constructing a time-dependent wave 
equation and an equation for multi-particle systems. The latter portrays the 
system in a Hamilton-Jacobi configuration space rather than in spacetime.
The time-dependent equation differs from the d'Alembertian by having 
an imaginary first order time derivative, instead of a real second-order 
time derivative. The cited distinctions between the spatial one-particle 
systems, and the multi-dimensionality of many particle systems, stress the 
metaphoric quality of matter-waves even more than for E.M. waves.
The Hamilton-Jacobi equation was indeed instrumental in the approach 
of Schroedinger, a circumstance which may have prompted a single system 
view. The Copenhagen interpretation soon consolidated this one-system 
view of the Schroedinger equation. A factor, supporting the Schroedinger 

66
CHAPTER IV
equation in general, is undoubtedly the isomorphism with the matrix 
mechanics pioneered by Heisenberg, Bom and Jordan. While the matrix 
method had no function equivalent, the function proved to be a major 
tool in calculating these matrix elements. The two methods complement one 
another without precipitating further interpretational perspectives.
After the Copenhagen single-system view was beginning to be firmly 
established, Popper^ and Einstein^ produced opposing views without much 
affecting the single-system trend that had already been set in motion. 
Fuerth^ focused attention on the similarity with diffusion processes, thus 
detracting from the single-system implication. Later Fenyes,^ Weizel,6 
Bohm-Vigier,7and Nelson^ emphasized, either directly or indirectly, a 
plurality view of the object to which the Schroedinger equation applies by 
revealing a close association with the Euler equations of fluid mechanics. 
All of these investigations represented, in some way or another, a hand­
writing on the wall that remained in part unheeded. An examination of 
Jammer's^ Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics reveals that the here given 
references are not merely isolated cases. There are many more names of 
people who have expressed opinions about the ensemble view of quantum 
mechanics: e.g., Kemble,10 Blokhintsev,H Ballentine,12 Groenewold,13 
Collins. 14
Comparing the choice between wave-photon versus wave-many-photon 
ensemble, there is not the slightest doubt that the choice between wave­
single rest mass system versus wave-ensemble of rest mass systems needs to 
be discussed in the light of new observations. Faced with this issue, the one 
and only way of resolving this problem is by an honest investigation into 
the question: which of the two situations is being treated by the 
Schroedinger equation?
The arguments used to settle the wave-photon choice applies equally 
well to the wave-system (particle with rest mass) choice. Also here the 
wave-(single) particle duality forces a comparison between epistemologi­
cally discordant partners. There is no unit of matter-waves to make the 
wave end of the duality compatible with the discrete realm of particles or 
systems. To make it compatible, Copenhagen called on the artifact of 
function normalization, an act which eliminated any possibility of ensemble 
density considerations for the future. It also led to the typically noncausal 
notion of wave function collapse.
Notwithstanding Copenhagen's ingenious attempt at creating dual­
partner compatibility between wave and system, it was man rather than 
nature that erected the modem edifice of nonclassical physics.

New Evidence Resurrecting Old Copenhagen Tools
If verifiable by evidence, the delineated positions are bound to deeply 
affect disciplines that have been shaped, either directly or indirectly, by 
Copenhagen views. Quantum electrodynamics(QED) is a candidate for 
radical change.
If the QED properties of the electron no longer are deduced from inter­
action with fluctuations of infinite vacuum energies, they now are to be 
related to an electromagnetic model instead. This model 15 yields spin and 
magnetic moment, including a model-based understanding of higher order 
moment anomalies. In accord with modem mathematical investigations, the 
spin concept is related to manifold orientability 16 and the enantiomorphism 
of physical objects therein (chapter XI).
Experimentation with squeezed light 17 offers an interesting option to 
substantiate an ensemble nature of Heisenberg's uncertainty. The 
Heisenberg uncertainty relation for fields automatically reinjects an en­
semble aspect in view of the earlier discussed wave-many particle duality.
Finally there is the following major question: If the Schroedinger 
equation is an ensemble tool, which, strictly speaking, no longer applies to 
single systems, is there a single-system tool to take its place?
The answer given here is: period integrals give a metric-independent 
generally invariant account of quantization, 18 and they are instrumental in 
determining model topology in spacetime. Moreover, they are the key for 
reconciling quantum theory and the principle of general covariance in 
relativity (chapters VI and XIII).
These integrals relate, in the sense of the WBK method, asymptotically 
to results of the Schroedinger equation. This mathematical asymptotics 
acquires physical meaning as an asymptotics between ensemble properties 
and the system properties of ensemble constituents. Ensemble results, 
obtained with the Schroedinger equation can be shown to be phase and di­
rectional averages of period integral data pertaining to single systems 
(chapter III;5). Period integrals can be applied advantageously to 
macroscopic single systems such as manifest in the quantum Hall effect^ 
(chapters VIII and IX).
6. 
Conceivable Interpretations of 4*
If the single-system interpretation of 4r is out, how does 4> relate to an 
ensemble description of systems? Even if there is now no longer a need 
for normalization, the product 4*4** still obeys a continuity condition. 
Hence, the magnitude of 4>4>* seems an extra parameter, the physical 
meaning of which needs to be assessed. Since normalization does not affect 

68
CHAPTER IV
the Schroedinger eigenvalue, change of 4*4** rather than ansolute 
magnitude manifests itself as the crucial physical parameter.
Similar to 4>4>*/ the electromagnetic energy density (E«D+H»B)/2 is 
quadratic in the d'Alembertian wave function. Since this energy density 
relates to a photon density in the photon ensemble, it stands to reason to 
relate 4^4^* for the ensemble of material systems to the system density in 
the ensemble. Yet, the 4* function of an ensemble of multi-particle systems 
exists in the Hamilton-Jacobi configuration space. This circumstance de­
tracts from an analogue to a photon distribution with boson properties. 
Since the Pauli exclusion principle complicates a density interpretation of 
4^4^* for fermions, the probability assessment was hailed as a rescue from 
this predicament.
In section 7 of chapter VI, the statistical features of 4> are shown to be 
related to an averaging process involving the parameters of a Hamilton- 
Jacobi family of orbitals. Each orbit is compatible with a set of given 
Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. The Schroedinger process thus becomes 
some sort of a universal substitute for the very specific averaging process 
that led Planck to the concept of zero-point energy (chapter III;5).
The potential function appearing in the Schroedinger equation is chosen 
to reflect only the inner potential field of a single isolated system. Under 
those circumstances, results obtained are relevant only to very dilute 
ensembles. For increasing ensemble density, the proximity of the 
constituent systems in the ensemble is bound to play a role and should be 
accounted for by adding a mutual system potential. The solutions of the 
Schroedinger equation in crystal field theory testify to the spectral changes 
due to such system-system interaction.
Planck20 identified the zero-point energy as a typical ensemble 
manifestation due to a phase disorder of the systems in the ensemble. This 
minimal zero-point energy in a phase random ensemble of systems is 
necessary to avoid a negative ensemble probability in the sense of statistical 
mechanics.
An example of an ensemble capable of making a transition from phase­
disorder to phase order, so that all systems in the ensemble are phase- 
locked, is the quantum Hall effect. This macroscopic quantum effect gives 
no evidence of harboring a zero-point energy for the phase-locked 
cyclotron states of the ensemble.21 Chapter HI; 6 relates the Schroedinger 
aspects of zero-point energy for circular motion specifically to the 
dynamics of the radial variable in the interval from zero to infinity. The 
latter feature strongly suggests for 4* the role of an ensemble based 
expedient, this role is identified in chapter VI; 8.

Copenhagen Rules out Copenhagen (flow chart)
When carried to its logical conclusion, a consistent interpretation should 
either affirm itself, or rule itself out of order as not relevant. The Bell 
theorem22 has done almost exactly that, except that the answer critically 
depends on who interprets the implications of the Bell theorem.
Initially, Bell's theorem and an experiment by Aspect were said to rule 
out the existence of so-called hidden variables. This statement took the 
wind out of the sails of those who claimed that quantum mechanics was 
somehow an incomplete theory. In conjunction with Aspect's experiment, 
Bell's theorem was read to mean that quantum mechanics (i.e., in its 
Copenhagen single system connotation) had to be a complete theory.
Accordingly, Bell was hailed as the savior of orthodox quantum 
mechanics, which comprises the combination of Schroedinger equation and 
Copenhagen interpretation. It is not clear whether Bell himself agreed 
with that assessment, because he has been quoted23 as still referring to the 
Copenhagen interpretation as "something rotten in the state of Denmark." 
The conclusions to be drawn from Bell's theorem critically depend on 
whether the missing information is believed to be of a local system nature 
or of a nonlocal ensemble nature.
Since the theorem applies to the standard apparatus of quantum 
mechanics, the missing information is envisioned as hidden in extra 
variables conceivably pertaining to the Schroedinger equation. Yet the 
Schroedinger process is local-global in nature. It means the Schroedinger 
equation itself is a local instrument, the solutions of which are subject to 
boundary condition that are nonlocal in nature. It thus follows that Bell's 
test of hidden information can only rule on variables locally hidden in the 
Schroedinger equation itself.
Hence, by virtue of its locally restricted starting point, Bell's theorem 
can not rule conclusively on nonlocal information. Examples of nonlocal 
structural features are, for instance, the structural topology of single 
systems, and for ensembles the mutual phase and orientation of the 
constituent systems of the ensemble. Hence the door is still wide open as 
far as nonlocal information is concerned. Probably against his own better 
judgment, Bell became the savior of quantum mechanics. Indeed, from the 
Copenhagen point of view with its point-particle thesis and the 
Schroedinger differential equation as basic instrument, the chances of 
injecting nonlocal information had already been successfully eliminated. 
Within that local framework, Bell's theorem and Aspect's experiment 
therefore confirmed the logical consistency of the Copenhagen schemeof 
things. Yet, logical consistency is a necessary, not a sufficient condition for 
physical realism.

Since the door is still wide open for nonlocal structural information, the 
Bell episode can now be considered in the wider context of local and 
nonlocal information. In view of the overwhelming evidence for the 
existence of and need for nonlocal information the Bell theorem can be 
used to effectively rule out the Copenhagen single-system view. The 
ensuing demise of the good old Copenhagen standby is illustrated in Flow 
Chart I.
The moral of this story is: Even good mathematics can be mis­
leading if the mathematical identifications of physics are 
wanting.
8. 
Conclusion
If the wave function is taken to describe the state of an ensemble, the 
associated must be expected to describe the density distribution of 
ensemble constituents. Yet, Copenhagen has accepted the permissible 
option of wave-function normalization. It then follows that the combination 
of Schroedinger equation plus wave-function normalization should be only 
capable of describing ensemble properties that are independent of ensemble 
density. Only highly diluted ensembles are, at best, sufficiently independent 
of density changes.
The acceptance of this rather unavoidable conclusion of ensemble 
behavior, as implied by the custom of thinking in terms of normalized 
functions, removes the Schroedinger equation method from the imagined 
goal of an exact instrument of description within the ensemble framework. 
By the same token, it diminishes the hope for an exact derivation of 
Schroedinger's equation as a realistic goal.
For the many years that the Schroedinger equation has been a major 
tool of physics, it has been somewhat perceived as a gift from heaven. Yet 
it is exactly this origin, shrouded in mystery, that also has been a source of 
liabilities. Its suspected lofty origin has raised the expectations about its 
wondrous capabilities to, at times, unrealistic levels. Its simultaneous pro­
cessing of order and disorder still remains a major incongruity of proce­
dure in the Schroedinger-Copenhagen process.
In retrospect, it now almost seems naive to expect a many-particle 
Schroedinger equation and Pauli's principle to give an exhaustive account 
of the dynamical performance of a complicated atomic or molecular 
structure. Yet, for many years, there has been the strong suggestion that 
such might be the case. The mystique of its origin gave it the benefit of the 
doubt. On the one hand the aura of being a gift from heaven worked its 
magic. It made people accept performance claims that might have been 
refused in other circumstances. The classical many-body hurdles gave the 

72
CHAPTER IV
nonclassical many-body intractability a measure of protection, because it 
stood in the way of a solid verification of exalted claims.
Recognizing ensembles as a plurality of atoms and molecules, any at­
tempt at ensemble description would have to cover at least those physical 
characteristics of the constituents that are determining for ensemble 
behavior. The two-fold nature of this assignment, however, engenders an 
inner conflict of objectives. Consider hereto that the ensemble constituents 
are ordered single-system structures, their joint behavior in terms of 
ensemble manifestations are taken to reflect a statistical aspect of disorder.
Physics has perceived as its assignment the dual task of finding tools of 
description that simultaneously cover aspects of order and disorder. One 
may have legitimate reservations as to whether any single instrument of 
description would be able to perform this dichotomous task. Yet, standard 
quantum mechanics claims it can do exactly that. The hybrid nature of its 
existing tools is apparent, because the Schroedinger equation is inherently 
statistical, yet its solutions need additional criteria of order, such as dictated 
by Pauli's principle. Unlike classical theory, in quantum theory, as 
presently known, there is no clear-cut separation between quantum 
mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics, because standard quantum 
mechanics always retains a "nonclassical statistical" residue.
Faced with physics' self-imposed assignment of straddling the fence 
between order and disorder, it now becomes understandable why the early 
Copenhageners opted for a simplifying "leap of faith" by leaving the 
ensemble out of discussion altogether. This was done by declaring the 
Schroedinger equation to be a single-system instrument. Nevertheless, the 
inherent statistical nature of the Schroedinger equation could not be denied. 
It took revenge for having its ensemble connotation ignored. It dictated the 
need for at least retaining a residue of ensemble conscience, which now 
manifests itself under the guise of some nonclassical artifacts, which had to 
be created for exactly that purpose. They are universal uncertainty and 
zero-point motion of isolated objects.
All in all, retains the character of a calculational expedient, a 
probability tool still looking for its universe of discourse. Perhaps the need 
for an interpretation of has been overemphasized and is out of tune with 
reality. The counterpart of ty, in the equivalent of matrix mechanics was 
later introduced as state vector. The eigenvalue process retains the most 
central function, not the state vector. The latter is normalizable by virtue 
of the homogeneity of the eigenvalue process.
The complexity of the situation makes it useful to once more summarize 
the state of affairs. In order to do so, it is necessary to face the emotional 
discomfort that is associated with reevaluating a good old friend and finally 
assessing this friend on a more realistic basis. I am speaking here of the 

COPENHAGEN VERSUS COPENHAGEN
73
Schroedinger equation. It had to be taken down from its not very practical 
ivory-tower position, where enthusiastic followers and admirers had put it, 
notwithstanding the strong warnings of its originator. From a magical 
tool, serving an indefinite realm of quantum situations, it had to be reduced 
to a level of plain ensemble pragmatics.
On the other hand, as a result of this reduction in status, new tools are 
needed, filling the vacuum where the Schroedinger equation can now no 
longer in good conscience be applied. The field open for new quantum in­
quiry comprises the single systems and the highly ordered ensembles. The 
latter behave as single systems, by virtue of the pronounced internal order.
The new tools, which logically become available to fill the void, have a 
topological connotation. This stands to reason, because a structural explo­
ration of single systems, or ordered ensembles for that matter, will have to 
start first with the topology of those structures. Only after the topology of 
those structures has been established is it possible to focus attention on their 
metric features. Yet once the need for topological exploration is rec­
ognized a new complication makes itself known.
Since the study of topology has been the near-exclusive prerogative of 
mathematicians, the mathematical backdrop they use has been purely ge­
ometric. Physics is, however, a discipline in which dynamic behavior in 
time demands an attention transcending the traditional geometry-based 
realizations preferred in mathematics. It is therefore unavoidable that 
physics has to find here its own way.
Notwithstanding the overriding geometric backdrop tradition in mathe­
matics, many topological development in mathematics are found to be al­
ready sufficiently abstract to automatically accommodate many of the needs 
of physics. Poincare torsion, as reflected in the distinction between space 
and time, should be cited here as a striking example. It illustrates how the 
art of abstraction has a capability of paying off (see chapter XII).

1. Summary
The following is a conceptual survey of the history of interpretation of 
the Schroedinger process of quantum mechanics. The presentation is 
nontechnical in the sense that no explicit mathematics will be used. No 
disrespect intended, if essentials are discussed by lightly paraphrasing 
results. I confess to these shortcomings, because I really did not see any 
other way of disentangling this extremely convoluted and massive amount 
of historical material. It was a predicament of keeping track of both the 
trees and the forest. Names mentioned in the title are those of principal 
protagonists who have been active during an odyssey which now has lasted 
for well over half a century. An attempt is here made at bringing out an 
emerging conceptual coherence if the propositions of interpretation about 
completeness are consistently viewed in an ensemble perspective for the 
Schroedinger process. The unproven and unjustifiable single-system 
premise, which is shared by many interpretations of the Schroedinger 
process, is here identified as the major obstacle preventing a delineation of 
previous efforts.
2. The Single-System Trap
Starting with Schroedinger, almost all those concerned with the 
foundations of quantum mechanics took the single-system option as a 
starting point of their considerations. There are a few exceptions. Popperl 
was one of the first who articulately verbalized his opposition against this 
almost tacit proposition that the Schroedinger process was believed to 
describe a single-system situation.
Einstein became only indirectly known as a single-system opponent. He 
was most concerned with the question whether or not the Schroedinger 
process could be assumed to give a complete description of single isolated 
systems. Yet, in a footnote of his correspondence with Popper, Einstein 
reveals that he shares Popper's opinion about the role of the wave function 
as describing a statistical "aggregate" of systems, not a single-system. 1
74

VON NEUMANN, POPPER-EPR, BOHM, BELL, ASPECT
75
In the following, the word "ensemble" shall be used for Einstein's 
aggregate. Unbeknown to many occasional users of quantum mechanics, an 
ensemble view of quantum mechanics has been able to coexist, until this 
day, with the far more popular single-system view. The latter is normally 
referred to as the so-called Copenhagen interpretation. The reader should 
be aware, though, that Copenhagen views may be subdivided in several 
sects. In view of their reduced relevance, this overview of interpretational 
options attempts to avoid an undue involvement in all the differences 
between those sects.
Two major factors are, in the following, identified as having predicated 
the convoluted development of contemporary quantum interpretation.
One is a firm popular belief that the mathematical perfection of the 
Schroedinger process ought to have an equally perfect physical 
concomitant, even if that perfection is not yet known to us in terms of 
physical interpretation. This attitude is clearly conveyed by those who 
speak of wave functions for the world and the universe. Others speak with 
great conviction about the first few microseconds after the Big Bang. 
Bell,2 tongue in cheek, confesses to finding a touch of blasphemy in the 
pursuit of such unnecessary ambitious goals.
The other factor is an overriding, yet rather unfounded, conviction that 
the gift from heaven known as the Schroedinger process was meant to 
describe a single-system. As far as I have been able to establish, here we 
find Bell^ siding with the single-system view of the majority. He does not 
take position against his fellow philosopher Popper, who has supported an 
ensemble view. I have found in Bell's book one reference to Popper. This 
reference has unfortunately no bearing on ensembles; it relates instead to 
an indistinguishability of preferred reference frames.
The trap that has been compounding the development of 
quantum interpretation is in the asymptotics between the 
ensemble and its single-system elements. The sometimes deceptive 
experimental closeness between single-system and ensemble behavior has 
fostered those beliefs.
The following is, if you will, a running commentary on Bell's book2 on 
"speakable and unspeakable," as seen from the angle of an ensemble 
supporter.
3. Johann von Neumann
Schroedinger and Pauli established the mathematical equivalence of the 
eigenvalue processes of Heisenberg, Born and Jordan with the 
Schroedinger wave-equation process. Wigner and Weyl initiated the use of 
the theory of group representations to establish relations between spatial 
symmetries and their manifestations in Hilbert space. This outline of the 

76
CHAPTER V
mathematical foundations of the theory was beginning to invite an attempt 
at an axiomatic formulation.
Since the mathematical apparatus of eigenvalue procedures, as used in 
the Schroedinger process, had been extensively studied by the Hilbert 
school of mathematics, it stands to reason that the first attempts at 
axiomatizing these foundations could be expected to follow the guidelines 
of Hilbert's formalist school.
In his treatise on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, 
Johann von Neumann^ established that the spectral theory of Hilbert spaces 
turned out to be the ideal instrument for treating quantum mechanical 
problems. In presenting the subject matter, von Neumann showed himself 
an extremely competent and faithful student of the Goettingen school of 
formalists. It is therefore appropriate at this time to contrast this formalist 
view against a pronouncement of a more intuitional oriented scholar. 
Herman Weyl later said: the fact that the spectral theory of Hilbert spaces 
is applicable to quantum mechanics is truly a "favor of fortune."
Seen from this perspective, it also stands to reason that the interest in 
the theory's physical foundations was very much colored by the near 
perfection of its mathematical foundations. Any theory of such 
mathematical perfection was bound to have a concomitant physical per­
fection. That is how quantum mechanics rode right into the center of the 
scientific arena on the coattails of the near-perfect spectral theory of 
Hilbert spaces.
Since the "completeness" of the series expansions, in terms of 
normalized orthogonal functions, was one of the striking features of the 
spectral theory of Hilbert spaces, it was now almost unavoidable that a 
measure of this completeness awareness was expected to somehow carry 
over into the realm of physics.
A statement and discussions to this effect was indeed first made by von 
Neumann and later further elaborated by Jauch and Piron. New insight was 
added by Gleason in an attempt at reducing the axiomatic basis of quantum 
mechanics. Then Bell^ entered the stage and with a Bernard Shaw type 
directness, he claimed that he could restate the position with such clarity 
that all previous discussions would be eclipsed. In doing so, he still left a 
door open for global physical incompleteness next to all this blinding 
mathematical completeness.
At this point, it is necessary to become specific in what respect the 
physical situation could be considered to be incomplete. It will be necessry 
to distinguish between local and nonlocal incompleteness.

77
4. Popper and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox
An inner contradiction between the claim of physical completeness and a 
wave-function description of a single event was put together by Einstein, 
Podolsky, and Rosen.4 In the light of our earlier discussion of the 
correspondence between Popper and Einstein, it seems strange that Einstein 
would entertain the discussion of a single event, in view of his expressed 
belief in a footnote of a letter to Popper. 1 In this footnote he says to agree 
with Popper that the Schroedinger equation’s wave function should be 
considered as describing an "aggregate" (i.e., an ensemble) of systems and 
not a single system.
In view of the, at that time, dominating Copenhagen conviction that the 
Schroedinger process had to be a single-system instrument, it must be 
assumed that Einstein wanted to show that this single-system premise would 
lead to contradictions, as indeed it did.
Yet, with all this emphasis on a footnote in a letter, one may well 
wonder: what was the actual content of this letter from Einstein to Popper? 
The content of this letter has been published in translation in Popper's 
bookl together with the German original in facsimile. Perusing the 
content, one finds the letter first questions the relevance of a physical 
thought experiment that Popper had brought to bear to bolster his position. 
The letter then continues with a brief description of a conceivably more 
promising alternative. It is the EPR thought experiment^ which, at that 
time, was in preparation. Though Popper's epistemological position was 
accepted, if only in a footnote, his thought experiment to bolster his 
posistion was wanting. The philosopher Popper admits how the 
consummate physicist Einsten disposed of his thought experiment, briefly 
and with great clarity. So where does that leave Popper's epistemology?
While Einstein, right from the start, acknowledges the probable 
correctness of Popper's ensemble idea, in his work with Podolsky and 
Rosen, he clearly envisions a single event situation, which, when seen in the 
ensemble perspective, could not be all that relevant. The answer to this 
paradox reveals that Einstein and co-workers were themselves attempting 
to produce a paradox, with the apparent intention of invalidating the 
Copenhagen single-system point of view.
Now looking in retrospect at this convoluted state of affairs, it remains 
still surprising why the ensemble point of view never emerged above the 
status of a perhaps half-way acceptable preoccupation of a rather small 
minority of physicists. Popper was in a very unfortunate position. His 
concession to Einstein concerning the inadequacy of his own arguments in 
support of an ensemble view has to be seen in the perspective of the times 
of the mid-Thirties. Einstein was already regarded as an older statesman 
of physics. An undisputed champion of the past, yet his famous remark 

78
CHAPTER V
"God does not play dice" placed him in a category not receptive to the 
nonclassical gospels emanating from the Copenhagen School.
The Thirties were, however, the heyday of nonclassical physics. Hence 
Popper, having been knocked out by a former champion of physics (who 
no longer was believed to be in tune with the nonclassical spirit reverberat­
ing from Copenhagen and Goettingen) had not much of a chance to receive 
a further hearing in physics on his ensemble views. Only the criticism was 
remembered, and Einstein's footnote was forgotten.
At this point, the single system point of view of Copenhagen had gained 
a not very deserving victory over the ensemble point of view. From that 
moment on, the single system view would dominate the 
conceptual development in quantum physics for the the next half 
century. The very small group of confessed ensemble supporters could 
not change this course, because they failed to collect truly decisive evidence 
in support of their position. By contrast, the nonclassical processes of the 
single-system school became bolder by adding daringly nonclassical energy 
infinities permeating the whole universe. They could boast some 
spectacular results in the development of quantum electrodynamics. All of 
which must be considered as having sealed the verdict on the ensemble as 
an object of description for the Schroedinger process.
5. David Bohm Reopening the EPR Box
In the Fifties, a new chapter in the interpretational developments was 
initiated by Bohm.5 While this was a new development, let it be 
understood that it carried on in the spirit of the single-system view. Bohr, 
using the full arsenal of nonclassical aids, had conscientiously responded to 
the EPR paradox. He had done so retaining the single-system aspect. 
Bohm, presumably not satisfied with Bohr's nonclassically tainted response, 
sought another solution to the EPR paradox. Rather than taking von 
Neumann's word for it that the Schroedinger process would be complete, 
Bohm initiated an investigation as to what happens if it is taken to be 
incomplete. He did so by suggesting the existence of new dynamical 
variables, the function of which was presumed to be hidden, at least for the 
time being. He was just opening up for those hidden variables a potential 
place, which might help in a future identification of their as yet hidden 
dynamical functions.
Bohm's hidden variables were an act of defiance against von 
Neumann's pronouncements concerning the completeness of the 
Schroedinger process. Von Neumann's presumed proof had been too 
much a mathematician's proof. It had too exclusively navigated in the 
wake of the spectral theory of Hilbert spaces to be accepted and justified as 
a physical proof of completeness.

VON NEUMANN, POPPER-EPR, BOHM, BELL, ASPECT
79
With Bohm, we see for the first time a breaking away from the almost 
axiomatically accepted supremacy of the Schroedinger process as a gift 
from heaven. By the same token Bohm's initiative also signalled a 
departure from an almost a priori acceptance of the use of nonclassical 
recipes as a way out of the conceptual predicaments. Bohm had taken 
position in the Bohr-Einstein dispute by declaring how much nonclassical 
imagery should be considered as paradoxical.
6. John S. Bell and the Aspect Experiments
Bohm's suspicions about the logical inadequacy of von Neumann's proof 
were taken up by Bell,2 with some spectacular and interesting results for 
physics. To make hidden variables acceptable as a convincing physical 
argument, Bell argued that they first had to be assumed to explicitly exist, 
in order to conclude what consequences they conceivably could have on the 
structure and predictions of the theory. He came up with a result that led 
to certain inequalities, where, in the strict Copenhagen perspective without 
hidden variables, only equalities could be expected.
With Bell, physics somehow entered a new phase of existence. Over 
and above the fact that physics itself went through some incisive changes, it 
was foremost a change in the type of personality that for the first time 
began to play a role at the frontiers of that science. With so many eager 
beavers anxiously making their sales-pitches to extend Copenhagen's lease 
on life, it was utterly refreshing to see a person who could look at all this 
in amusement and with a wit, which he also directed at the results of his 
own endeavors. He not only has an enviable vocabulary to convey his 
feelings about the subject matter; he also coined new words. Quantum 
mechanics needed this kind of person in order to come out of the doldrums 
of nonclassical mania.
So let us now turn to the upshot of Bell's work. The inequalities, 
contingent on the existence of hidden variables, opened up opportunities 
for experimental checks, such as performed by Aspect et al3 The outcome 
of these experiments confirmed the validity of the equalities of the 
Schroedinger process. So Bell’s inequalities were out and so were Bohm's 
hidden variables!
The result of these experiments was that Bell and Aspect had restored 
the integrity of the Schroedinger process as a complete theory. Somewhat 
against his own wishes Bell was hailed as the savior of quantum mechanics. 
In private he was heard as referring to the Copenhagen interpretation with 
Hamlet's famous phrase: "something is rotten in the state of Denmark."

80
CHAPTER V
7. An Ensemble Sequel on the EPR Paradox
Let us reiterate that throughout the here-cited Bohm-Bell-Aspect 
episode, which led to a reinstating of the Schroedinger process as a 
complete description, the single-system view had been taken as an 
undisputed starting premise. Any conceivable ensemble aspect had 
completely vanished from any level of awareness of the protagonists 
involved in these endeavors. In witness thereof, I refer once again to Bell's 
book, which has only one reference to Popper, having to do with preferred 
frames of reference.
The next question to be asked after this observation is: what about the 
small group of semi-accepted quantum physicists who, through all those 
years, have supported an ensemble view? It is probably fair to say that they 
have remained mostly outside the main stream of physics for a variety of 
reasons.
Through all those years, the ensemble supporters have not reported 
about a conceivable identification of a universe of discourse for the 
statistics of their ensemble. Recognizing the existence of at least some 
asymptotic distinctions between single-system and ensemble performances, 
the ensemble supporters are not known to have effectively addressed 
questions as to what type of quantum tools would have to be used in the 
treatment of single-systems. Neither have they recognized the need for 
establishing a special mode of treatment for the macroscopic quantum 
effects that have now taken center stage.
It would appear from this still very preliminary survey that, during all 
those years, most of the up-and-coming talents in physics were betting on 
making a career in the nonclassical world of a single-system view of the 
Schroedinger process. In doing so they received practically no competition 
from their ensemble brethren. Hence, the single-system people could 
afford to be tolerant to their ensemble colleagues. It was not necessary to 
ignore them. They virtually posed no threat to a continuation of their 
nonclassical pursuits. Let us see whether that situation can be reversed.
First we need to know what hidden variables mean in an ensemble con­
text. We know already, through the Bell criterion, that hidden variables 
don't have a role in a single-system context. To identify hidden variables 
that might have a conceivable role in an ensemble context, we need to 
consider variables that are inconsequential from a single-system angle, yet 
consequential from the ensemble angle. Mutual-system phase and ori­
entation are indeed consequential for ensemble performance; yet 
they remain inconsequential for single system performance. 
Phase and orientation of a single system only come into play as physically 
consequential by system interaction within the ensemble.

VON NEUMANN, POPPER-EPR, BOHM, BELL, ASPECT
81
Phase and orientation can now be considered as nonlocal hidden vari­
ables governing ensemble performance. They could not show up in Bell's 
test, which is geared to local conditions. When phase and orientation are 
subjected to a random distribution, they can be proven to relate to an aver­
age ensemble zero-point energy of >100/2 per single system in the ensem­
ble, and an average modulus of angular momentum b^nCn+l) per single­
system in the ensemble. The proof of the first statement can be found in a 
Planck classic^ of 1912; the second statement appears in the Feynman 
Lectures^ of 1967 ( see also chapter III;5 of this text).
Hence, the just cited results have appeared in the open literature some 
fifty years apart from one another; one appeared before and the other after 
the Schroedinger equation had appeared on the scene. They are two very 
typical Schroedinger results, which played a principal role in the rapid 
acceptance of the Schroedinger process as a new quantum tool in the mid­
Twenties. These typical Schroedinger results are here obtained with the 
help of a perfectly classical statistics, which involves the now "unhidden" 
parameters of mutual-system phase and orientation. While the Feynman 
lectures still present the angular momentum result as a perhaps interesting 
coincidental curiosity, it is presently the combined impact with the much 
earlier Planck result which gives this coincidence major status in physics.
The prophets of nonclassical physics will have to deal with this factual 
reality, because it substantiates a presumed nonclassical result with the help 
of a perfectly classical process of randomizing phase and orientation of 
systems that are individually quantized according to the older Bohr- 
Sommerfeld rules.
It seems highly unlikely that the following admonition can be ignored 
by further submergence in nonclassical imagery:
This one example of a classical duplication of results, that were hitherto 
believed to be typically nonclassical manifestations, imposes a dire obliga­
tion for a fundamental reassessment of whether or not nonclassical proce- 
dures are an essential and unavoidable ingredient of physics.
It is essential here to take note of the fact that mutual phase and orienta­
tion are nonlocal ensemble variables. As nonlocal ingredients, they are 
outside the jurisdiction of Bell's theorem. Locally, phase and orientation 
are physically inconsequential for system performance, because for an 
isolated system they are irrelevant positionings in time and space. Hence 
phase and orientation slip through the mazes of Bell's theorem.
8. Conclusion
These discussions have shown nothing less and nothing more than that 
the nonclassical imagery of the Copenhgen school can neither be exclusive 
nor conclusive, because it permits a rather classical counterpart in the form 

82
CHAPTER V
of phase and orientation randomized ensembles. These established facts 
raise serious questions as to the uniqueness and correctness of those 
standard quantum mechanical operations which claim a heed for 
nonclassical conceptualization as an unavoidable alternative.
It is furthermore established that the need for nonclassical imagery is a 
contingency of a rather tacit underlying hypothesis, which permeates, with 
few exceptions, almost all of modem quantum mechanics. It is the un­
proven assumption that the Schroedinger process is a single-system de­
scription.
Dropping the single-system hypothesis and replacing it by an ensemble 
hypothesis permits the combining of two statistical calculations discussed in 
treatises by Planck and Feynman. These calculations, reproduced in 
chapter 111:5, reconfirm two major predictions that were regarded as typi­
cal and crucial for the acceptance of the Schroedinger process.
While the Planck calculation was done well before the time when the 
Schroedinger equation had made its appearance, the Feynman-Kompaneyets 
discussions appeared some forty years after this event. The Feynman 
Lectures don't make an attempt at assessing its effect on the prevailing 
quantum interpretations of the day. It is presumably presented as an inter­
esting oddity, because it appears in volumes II and III. The surviving au­
thors of the Feynman Lectures may well be in a better position of casting 
more light on the motives that led to the incorporation of these calculations 
in their text.
In the light of this factual background we presume, it is the combination 
of the Planck and Feynman-Kompaneyets results that presently makes an 
assessment of its impact on quantum interpretation an unavoidable subject, 
which will have to be further addressed.
Perhaps regrettably, there is an anticlimactic quality to the ensuing re­
versal of the classical-* nonclasical transitions of the past. It brings the 
Schroedinger equation down from the lofty heights, as a gift from heaven, 
to a product made by man for man. By the same token, we may now better 
know its limitations, as well as as its amazing potential. Here is a prelimi­
nary perusal.
If the Schroedinger equation is indeed to be taken as giving an ensemble 
description, we need to ask what category of ensembles are admissible and 
what are the primary features covered by this description. In the light of 
the preceding discussions, the first question can be answered by mentioning 
that it should be a category of ensembles of systems that are random in 
phase and orientation.
In regard to the features covered, we may consider that an ensemble of 
systems immediately raises the question as to how ensemble performance is 
to depend on system density. Since the Schroedinger process works with 
normalized wave functions, there is a strong suggestion it covers a common

VON NEUMANN, POPPER-EPR, BOHM, BELL, ASPECT 
83
denominator feature shared by ensembles of varying degrees of density. 
We play safe by restricting matters to diluted ensembles, as long as there 
are no explicit system interaction potential in the wave equation. Seen from 
this angle, the Schroedinger equation without a system interaction potential 
just provides that minimal system interaction in the ensemble to establish a 
phase-and-direction randomness and concomitant zero-point effects.
A retrospective view at these endeavors shows how quantum theory 
through the years has vacillated between some as yet poorly defined proce­
dures pertaining to the concepts of local, nonlocal and global. The Bohr- 
Sommerfeld single-system approach with quantized cyclic integrals is typi­
cally global. The Schroedinger process and the Bell theorem exactly strad­
dle this local-global domain, which is so characteristic of an ensemble sit­
uation. The notions local, nonlocal, and global have emerged in mathemat­
ics as well as in physics. However, their definitions are, as yet, still in a 
state of limbo. A further alignment between the mathematical and physical 
concepts of local and global is undertaken in chapter VI;8.

Introduction
The dictionary definition of ensemble, which has served so well in 
chapter I, still yields further service in tackling the description of highly 
ordered ensembles. Since the local-global eigenvalue process has manifest 
limitations for ordered ensembles, the possibility of an all-global process 
now needs to be considered.
The inner organization of highly ordered ensembles suggests a proce­
dure that is global from the start. Mathematically, it means differential 
processes make place for integral processes. Such methods have been 
around for a long time and may be placed under the general heading of 
period integrals. An historic perspective is useful for getting acquainted 
with these global mathematical concepts. The ultimate objective aims at 
putting global methods in context for the purpose of topologically explor­
ing highly ordered situations (e.g., the quantum Hall effect). This leads us 
to a de Rham-style (quantum) cohomology of physical spacetime. The en­
suing perspectives for the dynamics of topological shape and the changes 
thereof are then further developed in chapters XII and XIII.
The words local and global, as used in the previous paragraphs, may 
not as yet signal an immediate mental alert in the context of physics. In the 
mathematical literature, by contrast, these words have become concepts of 
considerable consequence since the Twenties and the Thirties. There is a 
booklet (edited by Chemi) published in 1967 by the Mathematical 
Association of America, which was exactly aimed at familiarizing the 
world of mathematics more generally with these ideas. Having said this, 
one would expect a physicist, exploring the importance of these ideas for 
physics, to look forward to sparklingly clear definitions on the basis of 
which the incorporation of these concepts in the world of physics might be 
further pursued. The situation is, however, not quite as simple as all that. 
Yet, by the same token, this added complication is exactly what makes 
things more interesting (compare chapter XVI;3).
Marston Morse, 1 one of the pioneers of this branch of mathematics, 
mentions in his contribution that hard and fast definitions of the notions of 
local versus global (or equivalently in the small versus in the large)

are highly improbable and not really necessary or even desirable. Instead, 
we do better to go through a process of osmosis to absorb these ideas in the 
process of seeking new application. In physics, this realm of local versus 
global literally acquires a new dimension, by virtue of the transition from 
geometry to kinematics. We shall find that the kinematic backdrop much 
enriches the merely static backdrop of geometry. In fact, it gives some 
food for thought whether restricting geometry as a branch of mathematics 
may not be too confining for a free emergence of new mathematical 
concepts. Inspired by Morse's wise counsel, let us explore this new realm 
by using the added dimensions of kinematics and physics. In the process of 
doing so we may recognize many ideas that from time to time have already 
surfaced in physics as isolated fragments.
The phrase "period integral" is one of those things, which may not now 
ring a bell of recognition for many physicists. In fact, depending on spe­
cialization, the word may only have a ring of vague familiarity to many 
mathematicians. In recognition of these factual realities, a discussion aimed 
at delineating their fundamental role in physical description should do well 
by starting from scratch.
An idea of what a departure from a position of "scratch" amounts to is 
best obtained by establishing where and when period integrals have first 
been used in physical theory. If this intimates that period integrals are 
perhaps items of a bygone era, the answer is: yes! Therefore, using the old 
names has disadvantages, because period integrals have been around in dif­
ferent disguises and under a variety of name identifications. To avoid a 
premature identification with earlier more narrow connotations, a new 
name may well be desirable. Since our mathematical brethren have, in re­
cent years, much extended the concept and use of these structures under the 
name period integrals, let us adopt here this mathematical identification, 
because it does not conjure up undue bias of earlier physical applications.
The projected treatment therefore starts out with a reasonably encom­
passing overview of period integrals related to procedures in physics. 
Where the interrelation seems tenuous at first encounter, a preliminary 
attempt is made to call attention to common characteristics, justifying a 
lumping together in the same category. After having done so, an overview 
is given of period integration from an angle of the mathematics of differ­
ential forms. The definitions of differential forms have to be explicitly 
adapted to needs pertaining to parity and time-reversal operations of 
physics. Subsequently, the use of forms and their period integrals is 
sketched in their exploration of manifold topology. Finally, a transition to 
physics is accomplished by identifying the topology creating "substance" or 
"substances" of physics.

CHAPTER VI
2. Period Integrals in Contemporary Physics
One of the earliest and still most useful period integrals in present-day 
physics undoubtedly is Gauss' integral of electrostatics:
f D-dS = SkAk . 
1
C2
In Eq.l D is the field of dielectric displacement integrated over a cyclic 
(i.e., a closed) 2-dimensional domain c2. The right hand member of Eq.l 
represents the algebraic sum of electric charges qk enclosed by C2- Every 
textbook on the fundamentals of electromagnetism explains how the inte­
gration domain c2 of this integral can be dented or otherwise deformed 
without affecting its value, provided these deformations take place in 
domains of zero charge qk=O. According to Gauss' theorem, the deforma­
tions of c2 can only take place in domains where divD=0. It is this invari­
ance property of the right-hand member of Eq.l under deformations of C2 
in the realm divD=0, which is normally regarded as the most characteristic 
property of a period integral. The period integral acts, so to say, as a per­
fect sensor of what is inside the enclosure c2; it might be said to be a math­
ematical analogue of the human sense of touch by just making sure what it 
is we are dealing with. In fact, it does not matter whether the electric 
charge inside is of a macroscopic or of a microscopic physical size. Since it 
registers all charges inside c2, Eq.l is universally valid in the macro- and 
microphysical domain. Add to these observations that all charge is additive 
and reducible to an algebraic sum of multiples of elementary charges ±e. 
Since charge counting is not expected to depend on metric specifications, a 
metric-free rendition of Eq.l is implied.
Once Gauss' law has been accepted as the prototype of a period law, an 
immediate analogue presents itself pertaining to gravity. It says a closed 
surface integral of the Newtonian gravitational "displacement" g equals the 
sum of the gravitational masses enclosed by a cyclic integration domain c2:
f g-dS = Sk mk • 
2
C2
The integration cycle c2 is here deformable where divg = 0. Eq.2 is 
not as perfect a period integral as Eq.l, because, unlike electric charge, 
mass is not a perfectly additive quantity. The energy associated with mass 
interaction leads to a small mass defect in the sum mass, whereas electric 
charge interaction leaves the sum charge unaffected.
The just-given statement may at first seem only weakly confirmed. In 
the course of time, however, it has now become a factual truth bom out by 
longstanding observation. It is a consequence of established experience, 
which indicates that Coulomb interaction energies leave electric-charge 
unaffected. By contrast, gravitational and other interaction energies (say 
Coulomb) do affect mass distributions by virtue of the mass-energy 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
89
theorem of relativity. This theorem prevents mass from being a purely 
additive quantity.
The next period integral to be considered is the Ampere integral. It is a 
one-dimensional loop integral of the magnetic field H taken over a cyclic 
domain, say cP This integral equals the algebraic sum of currents Jk linked 
by Ci :
f H-dL = SkJk . 
3
ci
The cycle C] is deformable where the current vanishes (i.e.,where curlH=0, 
as follows from Stokes' theorem).
A comparison between Eqs.l and 3 gives the following items of infor­
mational interest. Eq.l is about charge at rest, Eq.3 is about charge in mo­
tion. Eq.l can only assume values that are multiples of the charge quantum, 
Eq.3 can assume a continuum of values depending on how fast charges 
move through the loop Ci.
Since the fields D and H jointly occur in the same Maxwell equation, it 
is tempting to give also their period integrals a joint connotation. This can 
be done by extending the physical period integral concept from space to 
spacetime.
Instead of enclosing charge at rest, in a spacetime context, Gauss' inte­
gral must be regarded as linking world lines of charges that are progress­
ing solely in the time direction. Tilting the worldlines in a spatial direction 
transforms the electrons at rest into electrons in uniform, cooperative 
motion. The C2, which was a closed spatial surface before the tilt, now is a 
closed two-dimensional C2 imbedded in spacetime.
The next question is whether a spacetime cycle C2 can, in general, be 
used for the purpose of selectively linking the worldlines of charges that 
are in a cooperative state of motion. The answer is yes! To see this, one 
may consider a time integration of the Ampere integral Eq.3, its right-hand 
member then assumes the dimension of charge. A spacetime unification of 
Eqs.l and 3 can now be written as follows:
| dtj H-dL - J D-dS = Skqk, 
4
T L S
in which the integration domains denoted by T,L, and S are understood to 
join up to form a true 2-dimensional cycle C2 in spacetime linking the 
worldlines of qk for all k.
Mindful of the traditional, inertial frame-based spatial identification of 
H and D, as commonly encountered in textbooks, the evaluation directives 
for Eq.4 seem easier said than accomplished. Whenever we see an integral, 
we are so conditioned to look for an evaluation that we may not see the 
obvious answer. To eliminate any conceivable concern, let it be said that 
the evaluation is already given in Eq.4, provided the C2={T,L;S} truly 

90
CHAPTER VI
resides in a charge- and current-free domain (divD=0; curlH=0). The 
major task is making sure the integration cycle meets the period integral 
specifications. As long as the C2 deformation invariance is met, the 
complete potential of a Cauchy-like procedure of integral evaluation is at 
our disposal. Of course, this fact is not too surprising, because the Cauchy 
integral in the complex plane is itself a period or residue integral.
While the Ampere and Gauss integrals were early, and perhaps the 
earliest, examples of period integrals (not only in physics but also in 
mathematics) a relative newcomer to this family of period integrals is the 
cyclic version of the line integral of the vector potential A. One may 
wonder: why did not the first pursuit of period integration by Ampere and 
Gauss trigger an all-out search for other examples of period integration in 
physics? A little detour in history provides some added perspective.
Earlier this century, a state of mind has been prevalent among mathe­
maticians, insinuating that knowledge of physics unduly burdens the mathe­
matical mind. Conversely, many physicists hold that too much mathematics 
obscures the true spirit of physics. To those mathematicians who have cho­
sen to remain ignorant of physics, it may well be a surprise that Gauss, 
who introduced the early concept of period integration in physics, was 
himself a mathematician.
Even if it is true that in science, as well as elsewhere, the master does 
well to know his limitations, the Gauss example shows how easily one could 
be shortchanged by undue cognitive restriction. All of which goes to show 
that words of wisdom, when pulled out of context, can cause a severe case 
of myopia.
So, returning to the subject matter, one finds that the key to these 
developments has been, without question, the integral theorems which 
convert cyclic integrals into integrals over the interior of the cycle. The 
two-dimensional case has been named after Gauss; the one-dimensional case 
has been named after Stokes. Work of Poincare and Brouwer has led to 
higher dimensional mathematical extensions of these integral theorems. 
They are now referred to as the generalized Stokes theorem. Only earlier 
this century became the application of period integration a major tool in 
exploring manifold topology (de Rham).
A new physical perspective on the integral jA-dl came to the fore, 
when it was found to occur as a phase factor of the Schroedinger wave 
function. The uniqueness requirement for the wave function then became 
associated with a cyclic integration of fA-dI. In this manner, F. London^ 
first inferred the possible existence of flux quantization, and Aharonov- 
Bohm subsequently elevated this integral to a neat, independent tool in 
theoretical physics. Its period integral features are beautifully illustrated in 
what is now known as the Aharonov-Bohm effect.3 Also London's 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
91
application to the super-conducting ring illustrates, at least in principle, 
how the integration path (as a result of the Meissner effect) is deformable 
in the field-free interior of the superconducting ring. Singular cases will 
come into the focus of special attention later, when it will be necessary to 
consider the possibility of field-free domains that can shrink to the 
integration cycle itself (chapter VIII; 2; the electron's field-free interior).
Since the vector potential A is part of a four-vector with the scalar 
potential V as fourth component; also this component needs to be included 
in the complete Aharonov-Bohm integral:
| A-dl - $ Vdt = 
, integrated over a cycle Ci= {L;T} 
5
The right-hand member of Eq.5 gives the sum of fluxes Ofc linked by q. 
While the period integral properties of Eq.5 seem to be beyond question, 
the fact is that its applications are not as clear and straightforward as for 
the Ampere-Gauss integral. In praxis, however, most cycles of Eq.5 are 
either purely spatial or purely time-like; cyclic in time is a return to an 
initial situation.
Another difficulty associated with Eq.5 has to do with the choice of 
elementary flux unit <b0 . When flux quantization was first discovered, the 
expected flux unit was h/e; the observed unit turned out to be h/2e. The 
latter unit h / 2 e typically occurs when the electrons are in cooperative 
fashion moving in each other's magnetic field. Such is the case in the 
superconducting ring; notice that this situation requires at least the presence 
of two electrons as participants in the process (see chapter VII).
Eq.5 could be regarded as a by-product of the Bohr-Sommerfeld 
integral |p-dL = nh, because p-mv-eA. Inside the field-free region of a 
superconductor, there is no momentum mv, which means f p ■ d I 
-»efA-dl. Hence, the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition assumes the appearance 
of an Aharonov-Bohm integral.
Since the asymptotic relation between the Schroedinger equation and the 
Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions is known to lead to a corrective modification 
of the latter from <£p'dL = nh to fp-dL= (n + 1/2)h, one may well wonder 
whether or not this correction could imply the existence of some sort of a 
zero-point flux, say in the sense ofe^A-dl = (n + 1/2)h for n=0. Taking into 
account the half-valued flux h/2e in superconducting rings, this would be 
|A*dl = (n + 1/2)(h/2e).
An inspection of the experimental data of Deaver-Fairbank and Doll- 
Naebauer^ does not give any support whatsoever for the existence of such a 
zero-point flux state (chapterlll; 6). Here again is a subtle reminder that 
zero-point phenomena are ensemble-related, not single-system related. 
Hence, the mathematical asymptotics between the methods of Schroedinger 

92
CHAPTER VI
and Bohr-Sommerfeld reflects the difference in the physical situations 
associated with an ensemble of single-systems versus an isolated represen­
tative of those single-systems.
Recently, magneto-resistance experiments, performed by several 
experimenters^ on extremely small-sized rings of normally conducting 
metals, have confirmed a resistance periodicity indicative of the London 
flux unit h/e. To observe the h/e periods, it is essential to work with rings 
that are flat. Experimentation with rings in the form of tubes has led to the 
observation of periods h/2e, notwithstanding the presumed absence of 
superconductive pairing. Interestingly, an explanation of the half-period 
h/2e was found to be related to an ensemble formation of phase- 
randomized parallel current sections in the tubular ring. One can hardly 
avoid noticing a similarity with Planck's introduction of the zero-point 
energy as an ensemble-based feature (chapter III).
The fact that many applications of Eq.5 are, strictly speaking, outside 
the realm of period integration proper may well have been a major reason 
why the parallelism between Eqs .4 and 5 has not been stressed in the 
physical literature. The integral Eq.5 retains, of course, physical meaning, 
even if the integration cycle is not in a field-free domain. For example, an 
electron in an external magnetic field circulates in a quantized cyclotron 
orbit. Its so-called discrete Landau orbits are found to link flux increases in 
steps of h/e not h/2e. Hence, in the pure period integral case the right­
hand member of Eq.5 is measured in multiples of h/2e, whereas the 
"nonperiod" case leads to a right-hand member measured in multiples h/e. 
Since discrete residues in the right-hand member are a trademark of period 
integration, it seems as if a period feature retains; even if the period 
condition does not seem to be met (chapter VII). Let us consider a 
somewhat similar state of affairs that has to do with the familiar Bohr- 
Sommerfeld integrals of the earlier quantum mechanics.
A convenient starting point is the equation of motion, say of an electron, 
in a central Coulomb field k/r2. In polar coordinates, one has, for the 
simple case of a planar motion:
mr - mr4>2 = k/r2 . 
6
Multiplication of Eq.6 with r gives in the right-hand member of Eq.6, 
the Coulomb potential times the electronic charge:eV = -k/r. Hence, a 
subsequent time integration over one period of the motion gives, on the 
right-hand side, the Aharonov-Bohm integral times e and on the left, after 
partial integration, two Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals. The end result is:
fprdr + <£p4>d<t> = e f Vdt. 
7

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
93
Since the left of Eq.7 is known to equal a multiple of h, then Eq.7 
implies
$ Vdt = multiple of h/e, not h/2e. 
8
Questions present themselves if we like to come to a well delineated 
understanding of the Eqs.7 and 8. First of all: are the Bohr-Sommerfeld 
integrals period integrals, and, if so, does that make Aharonov-Bohm, as 
applied in Eqs. 7 and 8, a period integral?
The Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals are indeed period integrals if the 
Pfaffian expression defined by the four-vector of energy-momentum 
{H;-p} is integrable, because the integration path can then be deformed in 
the domain where the local integrability holds. Here is a brief proof that 
shows how the Hamilton equations of motion are the very conditions that 
substantiate this integrability. Consider the Pfaffian
did = H(pL,qk,t)dt - SpL(qk,t)dql ; k,L = 1,2,3.
The expression dW is a total differential (i.e., closed in terms of 
differential form language; see next section) if the coefficients of dW 
satisfies the following relations of crosswise differentiation:
3H dpt 
3H 
3pk
V----------- + ------- -. — ----- Q
I 3pL 3qk dqk 
3t
dpi 9Pk
3qk " 3qi ’
Since 3H/3p[ = qL, substitution in Eq.9, while using Eq.10, gives after 
rearrangement the other Hamilton equation Pk=-3H/3qk, because Pk = 
3pk/3t + Sql-3pk/3q1' . It thus follows that the left-hand side of Eq.7 is a 
period integral. If that is so why is the right-hand side of Eq.7 not a period 
integral? We know it can be a period integral, but, as it is, the cyclic time 
path of integration resides in a realm of spacetime where the electric field 
E is definitely not zero. There are here a number of unusual features 
requiring a conceptual clarification.
First of all dUJ is a total differential, indicating the existence of a scalar 
field W from which H and p derive by a gradient process, yet there are 
loop integrals of p that don't vanish. It means that either lb is not single­
valued, or the integration loop links certain forbidden domains. This situa­
tion is similar as for the Gauss integral, its cyclic integrals vanish if the 
cycles don't enclose net electric charge.
After this comparison, the next question naturally is: what is the 
physical nature of the "obstruction" that is being enclosed or linked by the 

94
CHAPTER VI
cycles of the Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals? An answer to this question is not 
readily found in the existing textbook literature on analytical mechanics. 
The first explicit reference to this question that has come to my attention 
occurs in a little-known paper by Einstein^ in which he attempts to find 
more of a justification for the Bohr-Sommerfeld recipe of loop integration. 
Why does this recipe so surprisingly lead to very sensible answers? What 
happens if the integration loops are chosen in a different manner?
In the cited investigation, Einstem arrives at the conclusion that the loop 
integrations are only nonzero if they link with what may be called the or­
bital manifold. For a central force motion, the orbital manifold is a "flat" 
torus (opens up by orbital precession). The nonzero Bohr-Sommerfeld 
loop integrals link with the torus either as an internal azimuthal cycle for 
<fip <!> d <t> or/and as an external meridional cycle for <£prdr.
Note how the Einstein construction of replacing a flat annular region by 
a "flat" torus makes the two-valued p field single-valued. In so doing, he 
made the orbital manifold into a topological object and established the pe­
riod character of the Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals as a means to explore the 
topology of that object. Einstein's method was a precursor of a general 
mathematical procedure, which was, in particular, developed by de Rham? 
for exploring manifold topologies by period integrals.
The several originators of the Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals had all made 
a choice of intuition. Yet, Einstein's topological features never reached 
stages of maturity and fruition in physics, because, soon afterwards, 
Schroedinger's method replaced the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. The 
latter were then declared to be an approximation of the Schroedinger 
method, which was now believed to be the more exact answer.
Returning to the main theme of this discussion, the conclusion has now 
been reached that the left-hand side of Eq.7 indeed constitutes a set of 
period integrals. What are the implications of this conclusion for the right­
hand side of Eq.7 ? Here is an Aharonov-Bohm integral, which is known 
to be capable of displaying period features, yet in this case, the time inte­
gration path "resides" in an interval of time for which E 0. Even if 
there is no law that says period properties are transmitted by the equal sign 
of Eq.7 to the right-hand member, the possibility of such an occurrence 
should not be ignored.
Consider Einstein's orbital manifold for a Bohr circular orbit. The 
torus manifold now collapses to a circle. The integral |prdr vanishes, only 
|P4> d<|> * 0. Is the latter no longer a period integral, because its deforma­
tion domain has collapsed? It would seem an injustice to the procedure to 
deny the period property if the deformation domain has collapsed to the 
path of integration itself. In a similar fashion, a possible rescue operation 
for the period character of the right-hand member of Eq.7 ought to be 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
95
considered, so as to make sure no valuable opportunities are here unduly 
discarded.
A closer inspection of Eqs.6 and 7 raises questions about the hybrid 
character of these equations. On the right-hand side are the potential and an 
Aharonov-Bohm integral, which are honest-to-goodness field structures. 
Yet, on the left, there is, by contrast, a mathematical expression which def­
initely is not a field structure. It is based on abstractions such as particle 
mass m, which unlike particle charge e cannot, as earlier mentioned, be 
reduced to the same simple basis in field theory. What is being done here 
(and what everybody has done since Newton, Lagrange and Hamilton- 
Jacobi) is really an attempt at using a judicious mixture of field theory and 
particle abstractions.
Strictly speaking, the period properties of Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals 
are to be thought of as residing in a Hamilton-Jacobi configuration space, 
whereas the period integrals of field theory are presumed to reside in 
spacetime. The overlap of experiences is in their sharing of a common 
physical space of three dimensions. Since there are Bohr-Sommerfeld 
period integrals with regions of cycle deformation collapsing to the cycle 
itself, then why not have Aharonov-Bohm integrals with regions of cycle 
deformation collapsing to the cycle itself?
For a particle cruising in an external field, it is difficult to see, how­
ever, how, similarly to the Bohr-Sommerfeld case, the permissible defor­
mation domain could be said to have collapsed into the cycle itself. Yet 
there is still another possibility: it is the option of having particles with a 
field-free interior. Such particles trace their own quantized field-free orbit.
The next question is whether some of the known particles may be said to 
have a field-free interior, with the conclusion that those that don't have a 
field-free interior would be recognizable by a selectively distinct behavior. 
For instance, the discrete Landau cyclotron states of an electron in a mag­
netic field could be taken to be indicative of a field-free interior of the 
electron. All of which prompts the question: have other particles ever been 
systematically checked as to whether or not they occupy discrete quantized 
cyclotron orbits? A transition from point-particle concept to particles with 
field-free interiors may at first be a somewhat mind-blowing proposition in 
the light of modem methods of approach. Yet, since models with a field- 
free interior are actively considered in chapters VIII and IX, it may be 
well to become already mentally prepared at this stage. The fact is that 
many applications are contingent on this concept of particles with field-free 
interiors.
The hybrid situation between particle abstraction and field theory gen­
erates, however, numerous other questions. For instance, up to this point 
there are the one- and two-dimensional period integrals for fields: 
Aharonov-Bohm and Ampere-Gauss. They assess flux and electric charge, 

96
CHAPTER VI
respectively. Then there are the one-dimensional period integrals for par­
ticles of Bohr-Sommerfeld, which, according to Eq.7, relate to Aharonov- 
Bohm. The Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals, unlike the Aharonov-Bohm inte­
grals, assess an integrated form of angular momentum or action: not flux! 
It is the existence of discrete electric charge that enables this flux-action 
transition. Yet, charge itself is the residue (period) of a two-dimensional 
period integral. KiehnS has therefore concluded that, when assessed in 
terms of fields, angular momentum, be it orbital or in the form of spin, 
should really be regarded as the residue of a three-dimensional period inte­
gral. Since three-dimensional cycles can only be imbedded in a four­
dimensional manifold, a spacetime assessment of physical law now is un­
avoidable.
At this juncture, the presented overview of contemporary physical the­
ory indicates the existence of one-, two-, and three-dimensional period in­
tegrals for sizing up field configurations in spacetime. The residues of 
these integrals are flux (magnetic as well as electric), electric charge, and 
spin-orbital angular momentum. These residues are measured in terms of 
multiples ofh/eorh/2e, e and h. They are constants of nature, and, to 
the best of present knowledge, they are known to be good spacetime 
invariants under general spacetime substitutions. All these features happen 
to be natural topological prerequisites.
In this day and age, practitioners of non-Abelian gauge theories would 
most likely not tolerate an absence of the many times hypothesized mag­
netic charge. Mathematically this hypothesis claims that not all cyclic inte­
grals of the magnetic induction B should vanish:
$ B-dS * 0; at least for some c2. 
11
The original idea, that Eq. 11 should vanish for all c2, may well go back 
to Maxwell. Off and on, there have been suggestions, though, that Eq. 11 
might nevertheless be true. Yet, most of the time, such rumors have been 
followed by a withdrawal of the suggestion by the author or a rejection by 
the knowledgeable authorities in the field.
An exception was seemingly "Dirac's magnetic monopole."It lingered 
on, it was modified, and until this day it has remained an item of interest to 
theoretical physicists. In an act of justice and reverence to Dirac, let it be 
known that Dirac's integration cycle C2 was never a cycle. He specified a 
pinhole in C2 to let through a "singularity line" connecting the monopole to 
infinity or a monopole of opposite polarity. In other words: Dirac was 
careful not to violate the iron rule of Maxwell theory which demands 
Eq.ll to vanish for all honest-to-goodness true cycles C2 (i.e., perfectly 
closed without any pinholes whatsoever).
From a point of view of modem mathematical-physical theory, the exis­
tence of a magnetic monopole now is as impossible as it was in the past.

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
97
The fields {E;B} derive from a globally defined {V;R}, which has its own 
(experimentally observed) residues. De Rham's theorem then demands that 
the 2-form {E;B}, which derives from the one-form {V;R}, is exact (i.e., 
no periods or residues, meaning no magnetic charge).
Notwithstanding an exhaustive search over decades, all known efforts to 
experimentally identify magnetic charges have had a negative result. In 
this excercise in quantum reprogramming, the nonexistence of 
magnetic charge shall be accepted as Nature's near-unambiguous 
answer to this most encompassing inquiry into its existence.
3. Mathematical Tooling
In the preceding section at least three good period integrals of physics 
have been confirmed to exist. Two of them are in current use; they are the 
2-dimensional Ampere-Gauss integral and the 1-dimensional integral of 
Aharonov-Bohm. The third one, a 3-dimensional period integral, is of 
recent vintage. It has now been applied in situations of potential 
consequence. Yet, before such applications come to the fore, it is 
important to agree on some convenient mathematical language.
Since period integrals, as they are here used, don’t really demand a 
detailed evaluation in terms of coordinates and field components, a notation 
which does not require coordinate details is to be preferred. Cartan's 
method of differential forms (see ref.7) is the ideal instrument for such 
purposes. The method applies to so-called "pair" and "impair" scalar­
valued integrals. These integrals remain invariant under general spacetime 
coordinate changes, except that the impair integrals change sign under an 
orientation-changing spacetime transformation; the pair integrals do not!
Since the coordinatization is inconsequential, the notation leaves out all 
coordinate reminders. Hence, instead of 2^R|^dqL, one simply writes $R. 
For the double integral Z^HB^dq^dqk one similarly writes $B , or 
possibly <J><J>B, if the double integration needs emphasis. Antisymmetry of 
the element of area dq^dqk engenders, through the summation L,k, the 
corresponding antisymmetry Bh<=-B|<l. The symbols A and B, so defined 
through the indicated summations, are said to represent differential forms. 
They invariantly combine integrand and integration element. The differen­
tial form A is said to be a 1-form and the differential form B is said to be a 
2-form, definitions of 3-forms, or p-forms, for that matter, follow the 
same recipe. The number p is, of course, not allowed to exceed the 
dimension of the manifold n, because a form which has p>n is identically 
zero.
The differential operation allowed in this context has to preserve the 
cited invariance under general coordinate substitutions. It is known as the 

98
CHAPTER VI
exterior derivative d. The exterior derivative d operating on a p-form con­
verts this into a (p+l)-form. In three dimensions dR means curlA and dB 
means divB. In fact the exterior derivative d replaces all standard vector 
operations grad, div, curl, in three dimensions. Moreover, unlike these 
vector operations, d is valid in manifolds of arbitrary dimensions under 
arbitrary coordinate transformations. Hence, the mathematical tooling does 
not merely cover translations and rotations, also orientation changes and 
nonlinear transformations are also covered.
Since the invariance of the differential form operations does not depend 
explicitly on metric structure, its applicability becomes of special impor­
tance for those realms of spacetime physics that are not related to gravity. 
The basic quantization rules of nature manifest a perhaps surprising 
metric-independent general invariance. The latter fact may well be 
considered as indicative of a possible misalignment between physical reality 
and the many efforts of quantizing gravity.
The reader will note how higher manifold dimension and extension 
of the group of invariance give surprisingly added simplicity of invariant 
operations, albeit in exchange for a more discerning assessment of the 
objects on which the exterior derivative "d" operates. The simplicity of 
vector analysis in three dimensions is bought by a reduction to one vector 
species, which is possible only under the group of proper rotations. The 
differential form equivalent, by contrast, works with four distinct 
differential forms. They are the pair one-form, impair one-form, pair 
two-form and impair two-form, corresponding to four vector species.
There exists, of course, an equivalent version of vector analysis, which 
is not "watered-down" to a single vector species. A detailed discussion of 
how the vector species reduce as a result of group restriction has been 
highlighted in a text by Schouten.9 He makes an interesting comparison 
with Faraday's lines and tubes of force. So far, a differential form 
equivalent accounting for orientability features can only be found in the al­
ready mentioned text by de RhamJ Since physical description reaches 
further with all four vector species, Faraday was far ahead of the late 19th 
century mathematical simplifiers who gave us standard vector analysis.
While differential forms are these days standard fare in mathematics 
curricula for physicists, the applications to physics have not gone much 
further than lip service to Cartan's "new" methodology. The simplifications 
of the past, once hailed as milestones in undergraduate instruction, have 
gone too deep to expect sudden change. The objective of this section there­
fore, can, at best, be a reminder of what has been done in the past and what 
can be found in the literature.
The task of reassigning all distinct physical vectors to four species, 
which in the past were assigned to the one and only species of vector

analysis, is an undertaking that does not mix well with writing a 
monograph on quantum reprogramming. An international forum would be 
necessary, and, even then, one may still end up with a perennial fight 
similar to the one between the proponents of cgs- and MKS units.
If, in the following readers, are confronted with vector-assignment 
choices pertaining to the above, decisions to this effect are not always ac­
companied by complete explanations. Relevant sources should be consulted 
for more detailed information. Yet, of all the questions that can be ex­
pected to surface in this context, there is one that merits further elabora­
tion. It has to do with the physical role of what is known as the spatial and 
spacetime metric structure.
Almost all discussions in physics are predicated by the existence of a 
spatial- and/or a spacetime metric structure. The metric's function is one 
of giving us a comparison of size in space and a comparison of how fast 
things evolve in spacetime. Most physicists regard the spatial metric as 
something inherited from the neighboring discipline of mathematics. As 
such, it is not normally regarded as a typical subject for physical scrutiny.
The spacetime metric has more of an explicit physical connotation, 
because its major metric coefficient c2 invokes the vacuum speed of light c. 
The latter has been the subject of extensive physical investigations. Yet, a 
full-fledged involvement of the spacetime metric in physical theory has 
occurred for the first time with the event of the general theory of 
relativity. Its principal implications seem to be macroscopic in nature.
In the light of the above observations, it will be clear that the metric has 
now become much more of a physical entity than in the past. Yet, so far, its 
major physical impact may be said to be in the macro realm. On a micro­
scopic scale we normally extrapolate, "when necessary," the existence of 
the macroscopically observed metric. Yet, the phrase when necessary 
should really be replaced by the word "necessarily,” because the mathe­
matical tools that are being used in contemporary physics don't give us any 
choice at all. The standard tool of vector analysis, and just about any other 
tool of mathematical communication in physics, only exist by virtue of a 
built-in, mostly hidden, metric structure. In fact, it is built-in in a manner 
so as not to be seen, which is as well, because most of the time it is not 
needed; only the general theory of relativity invokes explicit metric use.
One could bring to bear a pragmatic argument to leave the metric 
where it is (i.e., invisible). One does not expect gravity to have a very ex­
plicit role in microphysical considerations anyway. It just happens to be 
that Cartan’s formalism of differential forms is based on metric-indepen­
dent invariant operations. It holds in differentiable manifolds devoid of 
metric structure. The injection of a metric structure (say, in the form of a 
metric field tensor) does not affect the here-delineated Cartan formalism.

100
CHAPTER VI
Hence, even at this point one could still leave well enough alone and 
proceed as usual, except that one might display at least some curiosity as to 
whether or not the metric-free austerity of Cartan's formalism has possible 
physical ramifications. The question has been asked by, among others, 
Cartan himself. A brief account with references can be found in 
Whittaker's treatise (chapter II, ref.2) on "the history of the theories of 
electricity and aether." The answer is: there are several laws of physics 
that can be written in a manner that does not explicitly depend on the 
spacetime metric structure. What does that mean?
Whittaker's account of this subject matter is very brief. He explains: 
"....discoveries (concerning a metric-independent physics) which have great 
potentialities, but the significance of which at present appears to lie in pure 
mathematics rather than in physics, and which therefore are not described 
in detail here." So the question remains: why is part of physics metric­
independent, whereas other parts remain metric-dependent? It is one of the 
most engaging puzzles of Nature. Does Nature present us with such puzzles 
just for the sake of some intriguing mathematical exercises, or is some real 
physics hidden in these conspicuous properties?
An answer to these questions can hardly be forthcoming unless these 
distinctions are made explicit in the everyday dealings with the subject 
matter. Without the use of a discerning mathematical tool, the awareness is 
simply not stimulated to more incisive perception. After the earlier 
diagnosis about contemporary mathematical communication in physics as 
completely tied down by metric contingencies, it now should not be too 
surprising that little progress has been made since these discoveries were 
made in the early Twenties. There has been little change, since Whittaker 
wrote those lines in the Fifties.
Now, more than sixty years later, the Cartan method has come more in 
the focus of attention, yet its metric-independent character still is falling by 
the wayside. Users may, at best, have noticed that this newfangled thing, 
which mathematics is trying to sell to physics, works well only in certain 
parts but not so well (or not at all) in other parts of physics. A natural 
reaction is: why learn a discipline that is less versatile than what is 
presently being used?
The fact is that form-language does not go so well with a contemporary 
physics, which is completely cast in metric-based language. Here we have 
the upshot of modem trends of "prematurely selling" form-language pro­
grams. The result is a number of ad hoc applications and some temporary 
lip service to a new and exciting methodology, and then little or nothing 
happens thereafter.
The only way of making these developments less dependent on fashions 
and temporary trends is by first pinpointing a potential physical 
significance of the existence of metric-free laws. Since the spatial metric is 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
101
the one and only basis for comparisons of size, the validity of a metric-free 
law should be independent of whether one is confronted with macro- or 
microscopic situations. In other words, metric-free laws have a more 
universal validity. Any metric-free law that has been established in a 
macro environment thus has a fair chance of retaining its validity in a 
micro environment.
It has not been customary to make comparable metric versus metric- 
free distinctions for the time domain. BirsslO notes how spatial metric or 
metric-free does not always go hand-in-hand with spacetime metric or 
metric-free. Here the perhaps radical objective is pursued of identifying 
laws that are spacetime metric-free. This endeavor has interesting 
ramifications. For instance, in black holes metric notions are believed to 
change dramatically, yet metric-free laws can be taken to be unaffected. 
While contemporary physics is not in a position of making observations in 
black holes, there is solace in the thought that there are things in nature that 
might not even be affected by black holes.
4. 
The Integral Theorems of Stokes and de Rham
In the course of these discussions the name "de Rham" has been men­
tioned several times. For purposes which are being pursued here, two 
theorems in mathematics known as "de Rham's theorems" are of crucial 
importance and shall be referred to frequently. For physics, the 
understanding and objective of these theorems is much facilitated by a com­
parison with Gauss' theorem of electrostatics.
Gauss' theorem of electrostatics says (Eq.l, section 2 of this chapter): 
the cyclic integral of the dielectric displacement D equals the algebraic sum 
of electric charges enclosed by the cyclic domain c2 of integration. The 
cycle c2 is hereby understood to reside where divD=0.
For purposes of topological applicability, de Rham casts the Gauss 
statements in the form of an existence theorem. He says, given a set of 
scalars (charges) distributed in space, it is always possible to construct a 2- 
form (here defined by D) such that its cyclic integrals equal the chosen set 
of scalars, or algebraic sums thereof, depending on the choice of c2.
When visualizing this situation from an angle of Gauss' original theo­
rem, we are inclined to think of a "comer" of physical space in which the 
"few charges" that we had in mind reside. We rule out the rest of the uni­
verse with all its charges and merely examine the few charges under con­
sideration. This choice is a mathematically permissible act of convenience, 
yet by the same token, in doing so, the option of making assertions about 
the totality of the whole physical universe has been forfeited. In mathemat­
ics the universe can be chosen; in physics, it is given, hence we need to 
settle for step-by-step exploration.

102
CHAPTER VI
We now need to consider dimensional generalizations of the de Rham's 
"existence" version of Gauss' theorem of electrostatics. Where Gauss con­
siders 2-forms in a 3-dimensional space, de Rham considers p-forms in an 
n-dimensional space with p<n.
At this juncture, we can appreciate the physical merits of de Rham's 
generalized existence version of Gauss' theorem of electrostatics. Its proof 
calls on a generalized version of Gauss' integral theorem, also known as 
Stokes' generalized theorem. Using the Cartan notation, the generalized 
Stokes' theorem for the p-form fp can now be succinctly written as:______
Generalized Stokes'- (Gauss) theorem
fCpfp=f(jp+|dfp ; with 9dp+i =cp =bounding cycle of domain dp+1 
The theorems of de Rham are in essence corollaries of the generalized 
Stokes' theorem. They come about by "removing" from the embedding 
manifold the domains where dfp is nonzero. The thus remaining manifold 
has received a topological structure by virtue of its "holes." This reduced 
manifold has everywhere dfp = O, yet not every one of its cyclic integrals of
fp vanishes. The differential form fp in this reduced manifold is said to be 
closed. Only those cyclic integrals vanish whose cp does not enclose or link 
a hole that has resulted from removing those domains where dfp* 0. It is 
general procedure in geometry and in differential topology to speak of 
"holes," where physics prefers to endow the hole with an analytic continua­
tion of fp where dfp * 0. In either case, whether one speaks of holes or of 
domains where dfp *0, both have the function of assigning a topological 
structure. In the case of dfp * 0, the topology is dictated by physics.
The second de Rham theorem is a special case of the first theorem. It 
represents a case for which all the periods vanish. An earlier form of this 
reduced version of de Rham's first existence theorem has also been known 
as Poincare's lemma.
Using the terminology and notations explained in the previous sections 
de Rham's theorems can now be briefly formulated. An inspection of the 
literature will yield a number of equivalent renditions. One may, of course, 
consult de RharrJ himself, his articles and his monograph. His articles 
testify to the fact that electromagnetic situations have been a source of 
major inspiration. Flanders^ has made further attempts at making these 
matters available to physics and engineering. A beautiful discussion of the 
de Rham theorems has been given by Hodge in a monograph on the subject 
of harmonic integrals.^ The reader be advised that harmonic integrals are a 
metric-based follow-up of the metric-free period integrals of de Rham's 
theorems. The following is somewhat a common denominator version, 
which follows the theorem sequence (first, second) given by Hodge.

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
103
De Rham's first theorem:
Given a "basis" of p-cycles (cp)s on an n-dimensional manifold M, 
where p<n and s=l,2,3,4,..........enumerates the basis of independent
cycles on M. Let to each p-cycle be assigned an arbitrary real number 
(orp)s, then there exists on M a regular closed p-form <t> with the 
assigned periods (ap)s, i.e.
f(Cpls4* = (aPJs •
De Rham's second theorem
If <t> is a closed p-form with all zero periods, i.e. (orp)s =0 for 
all s , then 4> is exact and there exists a (p-1) form T| such that 
dr|=<t> .
The key to the applicability of these theorems is in the concept of the 
basis of independent cycles that is being considered. Looking at the first 
theorem in the perspective of Gauss' theorem of electrostatics, the complete 
basis of independent cycles identifying all the charges of the physical uni­
verse is so enormous that it is impractical to handle. For isolated physical 
structures, however, imbedded in this universe, the complete collection of 
independent cycles may be expected to be a more manageable number. 
Under those circumstances, the first theorem already can have an important 
structure-determining function.
The applicability of the second theorem on the other hand is contingent 
on the condition that all periods vanish, which is not an easily verifiable 
task if the totality of the whole physical universe needs to be considered. 
Hence, for applications of the second theorems in the context of physics, 
the reader should be keenly aware that physics can only speak in good con­
fidence of its human "comers" of the universe, with a few isolated struc­
tures. Unlike physics, mathematics can more easily consider the global 
nature of the manifolds it cares to consider. It is this very fact that has 
permitted physics to avoid a face-to-face confrontation with the distinction 
of closed-versus-exact for differential forms. The experimentally uncon­
firmed, yet forever recurring contemporary concept of the magnetic 
monopole testifies to the fact that physics is firmly determined to have its 
cake and eat it too. Mainstream physics has now, for over half a century, 
ignored the closed-versus-exact distinction as an issue of fundamental 
physical relevance!
In these reprogramming discussions of quantum theory, it is argued that 
so many different people have now been exploring so many different 
"comers" of the universe that the chances of finding exceptions to the 

104
CHAPTER VI
here-assigned closed-exact distinctions becomes very small indeed. Since 
the existence of magnetic monopoles would reduce the definition Eq. 16 of 
the vector potential A to an, at best, local role, any global applicability of 
the Aharonov-Bohm integral would be in question. Faced with the 
experimentally verified global consequences of this integral, as in the case 
of flux quantization, unverified hypotheses restricting that global 
applicability cannot claim a basis in physical reality. In this light, we should 
no longer curtail a prominent role of de Rham's theorems in the realm of 
physics.
5. Gauss-Ampere, Aharonov-Bohm and Kiehn Integrals
This new instrumentation can now be used to give an overview of a 
number of physical laws that can be lifted out as permitting a metric-free 
period integral formulation. At this point, no attempts are made to sub­
stantiate or prove explicitly this metric-independent spacetime invariance. 
There is a good reason here not to obscure the main issues with lengthy 
mathematical proofs.
There was a time in physics when it was thought to be necessary to 
prove how everything under the sun in physics could be written in a gen­
erally invariant form. Soon afterwards it became clear that just about ev­
erything in physics could indeed be forced into a generally invariant form.
The now following Eqs. 12 through 21, which express familiar physical 
laws or natural ramifications thereof, are distinguished by the spacetime 
metric-free property. Metric-free extensions of those laws in spacetime 
have been established for the one-dimensional flux integral of Aharonov- 
Bohm integral, the two-dimensional charge integral of Ampere-Gauss inte­
gral and a three dimensional spin angular-momentum integral proposed by 
Kiehn,for a joint discussion see reference. ________________________

105
Impair forms^ are here denoted by using a Venice font of script symbols: 
G, S, C.
It is important to point out how the exterior derivatives of the 
differential forms A, G and S give a set of 2, 3, and 4-forms respectively, 
which have familiar roles in physics:
The Gaugeable Fields A, G, S
dA = F ; the 2-form of the electric field E and magnetic induction B. 16 
dG = C ; the 3-form of charge density p and current density j. 
17
dS = L ; this 4-form L is a pure divergence Lagrangian density. 
18
Eq. 16 is the familiar definition property of the vector potential, Eq. 17 
are the matter related Maxwell equations, Eq. 18 may have only a latent 
familiarity, yet in practice many or most of the Lagrangians used in 
physics are pure divergences. 12
When taken in a global sense, the Eqs. 16-18 imply, according to the 
theorem by de RhamJ that the new differential forms F, C , L are "exact," 
which means, they have only zero periods:___________________________

$ C= 0; for all c3; global charge conservation (impair) 20
f L = 0; for "all" c4= M4; i.e., if spacetime is cyclic, (impair) 21
The properties of Eqs. 19-21 are to be distinguished from the properties 
of the differential forms A, G, S, as displayed by Eqs. 12-15. The latter are 
called "closed," because their exterior derivative only vanishes in specific 
domains with the result that not all their cyclic integrals vanish.
The nonzero periods (i.e., residues of period integrals) versus the zero 
periods convey information about the topology of the specific domains 
where the exterior d vanishes. This method of probing topology is called 
"de Rham cohomology." In mathematics, it is not customary for closed 
differential forms to distinguish between domains of zero and nonzero 
exterior derivative; nonzero domains are a "holes" in the manifold!
In physics, by contrast, it is essential to give attention to the physical 
causes that make the hole act as a topological obstruction. Here we arrive at 
one of the major challenges of a period integral use in physics. One cannot 

106
CHAPTER VI
expect an investigation of the topology of physical structures to be a carbon 
copy of investigations of the topology of abstract mathematical manifolds.
From this point on, it will be necessary to carefully probe physical sit­
uations so as to get an intuitive feeling of how to proceed, and then, from 
time to time, to call attention to the mathematical-physical parallelism. In 
so doing, it is well to keep in mind that the mathematical concept of 
topology in its most fundamental form, derives, after all, from the 
perceived physical existence of boundary separations, enabling us to speak 
of inside and outside domains (i.e., the Jordan curve separates in two 
dimensions; in higher dimensions it is the Jordan-Brouwer hyper-surface). 
Through the years, mathematics has had a preference for using static 
geometric metaphors to illustrating topology. In physics, kinematic 
illustrations are needed to account for the dynamic nature of spacetime.
The point of primary interest is now to identify a physical "entity," 
which separates domains in what is believed to be the arena of physical ex­
periences. Is it three dimensional physical space, or is it the celebrated 
spacetime of Minkowski? In the light of the preceding discussions, a space­
time basis is favored, because all the invariant residues of the period inte­
grals with which we have become acquainted, i.e., charge e, flux h/e, and 
(action integrated) spin-angular momentum h are known to be proven, 
metric-independent, general invariants in spacetime.
What are the spacetime entities eligible as domain separators? In 
spacetime, it would have to have a three-dimensional connotation. Electric 
charge is a major candidate. The Faraday cage effect and the Meissner 
effect of superconductivity both testify already to the macro-ability of 
charge and current to function as spatial domain-separators.
To be a domain separator in the submicroscopic domain elementary 
charge would have to be a dynamic 3-cycle in spacetime. The word 
"dynamic" refers here to the inescapable spacetime connotation of a three- 
form of charge. It is difficult to avoid here an explicit involvement with 
time. A cycle c3 can only close in spacetime. A static "ball" or "sphere" of 
charge, unsupported by Faraday's metallic cage, will be discussed a little 
later. It is a rare manifestation, but perhaps possible in ball-lightning.
The elevation of elementary electric charge as a basic cause and genera­
tor of physical topological structure in Nature is, of course, a far-reaching 
step, the viability of which can only be judged on the basis of its conse­
quences. Charge seems to be either an explicit or an implicit constituent of 
almost all rest-mass carrying elementary particles. The neutral pion, 
which falls apart in photons only, seems, at this point, an exception, unless 
one notes that photons can create electron-positron pairs. The electron tre­
foil, to be discussed later, is, so far, the only explicit example which re­
veals how particle properties can be tied together with the help of a topo­

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
107
logical model. The large number of mostly unstable elementary particles 
thus provides a real challenge for topology-based conceptual experimenta­
tion in this arena. Let us examine in more detail some known situations.
At this point, we have three period integrals that have all the 
appearances of being choice instruments for topological probing. What 
exactly is it they probe? The geometric realizations of topological models 
in three dimensions can be conveniently simulated with appropriately 
carved pieces of wood, steel wire and paper. Yet when dealing with 
configurations created by Mother Nature herself, the initiative for 
providing the configuration is Hers, not ours! Since physical objects exist 
in spacetime, visualization is a step more difficult than in three dimensions. 
In fact, just visualization is not enough. Real-world things have a way of 
evolving in time; they may be stationary for certain and sometimes very 
long intervals of time, but then they change. In the elementary particle 
domain, these changes can take place very fast (i.e., these events are very 
localized in spacetime). This kinematic backdrop for topological probing is 
related, yet, in principle, very different from the static geometrically 
oriented backdrop that has been customary in mathematics.
In the next section, these matters will be somewhat intuitively 
approached by using physical examples. There are, however, some general 
directives that can be helpful to keep in mind. A major function of the 
model used for backdrop is one of visualizing how the object in question 
occupies space and, as frequently happens, how it separates space in inner 
and outer domains. For the geometric model, this separation usually is 
accomplished with the help of paper. For physical objects, governed by the 
three period integrals, the "separation" must presumably have something to 
do with the physical fields that happen to define the differential forms of 
these period integrals. So what is it that could conceivably separate these 
definition domains of physical fields?
An indication of how these separations physically come about can be 
obtained from the already-mentioned familiar and traditional macroscopic 
three-dimensional configurations. A classical static example is the Faraday 
cage. Inside the cage a, nonzero, although constant potential field can exist; 
yet, since the gradient of this constant vanishes, the electric field inside is 
zero, whereas outside it is definitely nonzero. Hence, more abstractly, by 
making things independent of the cage material, a charge sheath acts as sep­
arator of inner and outer domains. In fact, this picture may not even be all 
that abstract, if we realize that ball-lightning could conceivably be envi­
sioned as a cage, consisting of a plasma sheath held together by Casimir 
forces.
A dynamic example of a domain separator is the "skin" of a supercon­
ductor. Consider a superconducting ring with circulating current. The 
current sheath of the ring is known to be a perfect separator of inner and 

108
CHAPTER VI
outer domains. The London equations show the vector potential inside the 
ring to be different from zero, yet its curl vanishes; so inside the electric 
field and the magnetic induction are zero. However, in the outer domain, 
one finds a nonzero magnetic induction and, if the ring has an excess elec­
tric charge, a nonzero electric field.
These concepts are now to be tested on macro- as well as on 
microphysical examples. Microphysically, one postulates the existence of 
charge-sheath separators, even for elementary charge. Interestingly, 
applications of period integrals hinge on the micro-physical field-free 
interiors of the particles involved.
6. 
Physical Gauge and de Rham Theory
The distinction between closed and exact forms critically relates to 
several aspects of what is known as "gauge theory in physics. A few words 
are in order to delineate the situation. The outcome of this comparative 
discussion will be found to strongly favor a physics-based de Rham 
approach as a natural successor to the more traditional physics-based gauge 
discussions. It should be mentioned, though, right from the start, that this 
de Rham-based development remains incompatible with the more recent 
non-Abelian gauge theory. This is exactly the reason why a discussion of 
this aspect is here unavoidable.
An awareness of gauge in physics first surfaced with the introduction of 
the vector potential as a mathematical expedient in electromagnetic theory. 
Locally the vector potential could only be defined modulo a pure gradient 
field. The family of arbitrary gradient additives was referred to as a set of 
permissible gauge changes of the vector potential. Since the set has closure 
properties, it is customary to speak of a gauge group. The gauge groups 
here referred to are strictly Abelian.
The local indefiniteness of these gaugeable quantities led to speculations 
as to whether one gauge would be physically more important than others. 
All this local indefiniteness, though, remains globally inconsequential for 
cyclic integrals of those gaugeable quantities, because cyclic integrals of 
exact parts vanish. In the course of time, this local indefiniteness of the 
vector potential was extended by acts of theoretical experimentation, by 
enlarging the Abelian gauge group to an non-Abelian group.
Prior, though, to the emergence of the gaugeable vector potential, the 
Gauss and Ampere laws of electromagnetic theory already had manifested 
earlier evidence of local indefiniteness similar to that of the vector 
potential. The integrands of these integral laws permitted "additives" that 
were divergence-free and curl-free respectively. Here the traditional free- 
space constitutive field identification D-*E and H-»B, though, provided an 
opportunity to fix the gauge in a physically useful way. The fields D and H 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
109
so appeared more tangible as measurable local quantities than the more 
gauge-evasive vector potential A.
The expression for a charged particle's field momentum eA holds some 
promise to similarly fix a gauge for A. Yet, uncertainty as to whether 
particles can be purely electromagnetic in origin has, so far, been standing 
in the way of an equally conclusive gauging of the vector potential.
It is well known that the questions as to whether the fields A,D,H are 
locally measurable quantities have perennially plagued physics. Since their 
local measurability is contingent on the Choice of a physically meaningful 
gauge, this question for a unique gauge remains the key to this predica­
ment. The situation has, so far, not much of a prospect for a resolution.
A prime reason for this seemingly unsatisfactory state of affairs has to 
do with a predilection in physics for placing undue emphasis on locally 
based interpretations, even when an unbiased observation of experiment 
suggest otherwise. The truth of the matter is that some fields, say, E, B 
and the associated Lorentz force, permit an unambiguous local assessment, 
whereas others, such as A,D,H, definitely don't! For the latter, only cyclic 
integrals acquire a well defined meaning in terms of quanta of flux and 
electric charge.
Having gone through some of the mathematical tooling associated with 
de Rham theory in the previous sections, it should now not come as a 
surprise that the distinction between exact and closed is, or should be, at 
the conceptual root of physical gauge. The overemphasized and unduly 
heralded distinctions between classical and nonclassical also find an 
unexpected common ground in the concept of period integration that 
emerges from the de Rham theorems. Period integration naturally 
accommodates quantization, yet, in view of the purely additive features 
invoked by de Rham theory, it stops short of accommodating any form of 
non-Abelian gauge. Here are some major mathematical and physical 
reasons justifying reservations with respect to non-Abelian gauge theory.
Mathematically, de Rham's theorems become inoperative in the non- 
Abelian context; they simply cease to exist. It is not at all clear whether it 
would be meaningful to look for a non-Abelian analogue of these theorems. 
These mathematical reservations indicate a forfeiting of the exclusive 
global perspectives associated with Abelian gauge. These points are 
conveniently ignored in most discussions of non-Abelian gauge.
Physically, non-Abelian gauge arguments frequently have been used in 
conjunction with an hypothesized concept of magnetic charge; they are also 
known as magnetic monopoles of such charge. Yet, from an Abelian point 
of view, magnetic charge has to be ruled out as a realistic physical concept, 
because the 2-form F, defined by the fields E and B, can only be exact. 
The reasons for this exactness follow directly from de Rham's second theo­
rem, because this 2-form F is the exterior derivative of the one-form R 

110
CHAPTER VI
defined by scalar- and vector potential. Since a use of de Rham's theorem 
is contingent on a global connotation of R, it should now be mentioned that 
a global definition domain of R is physically extremely well supported by 
the many applications of the Aharonov-Bohm law. Conclusion: here we run 
into a contradiction between Abelian and non-Abelian gauge.
Some of the magnetic monopole extremists are quite willing to deny the 
vector potential a global domain of definition, in which case de Rham's 
second theorem would become inoperative. It is necessary, however, to 
weigh the implication of such a desperate act of rescuing the magnetic 
monopole hypothesis. As already mentioned, the Aharonov-Bohm effects 
vividly emphasize a global relevance of the one-form R. In addition, the 
most exhaustive searches for the hypothesized monopole residues of the 2- 
form F have all been negative. In the face of all this incontrovertible evi­
dence, it would not be wise to sacrifice a globally exact F for a nonexact 
(closed) F? The mutual exclusiveness of the here-depicted alternative does 
not come to the fore, neither in the traditional classical Abelian treatment 
nor in the nonclassical non-Abelian treatment, because both neglect the 
local-global distinctions that are the conceptual hallmark of de Rham 
theory.
Let us summarize these conclusions:_____________________________
The fields E and B (which define the exact spacetime pair 2-form F) 
can be given precise local meaning as measurable quantities through the 
Lorentz force. The fields A and {D; H}(which define the closed spacetime 
pair one-form R, and the closed spacetime impair 2-form G) are, by 
contrast, not in general locally measurable; they are defined modulo exact 
parts. Yet, the cyclic integrals of R = (V,A) and G=(D,H) are globally 
measurable quantities that are expressible in terms of Nature's natural 
quanta of flux, electric charge, and action. The latter includes orbital and 
spinorial integrated angular momentum.

Action Extrema and Action Conservation
The odyssey in the realm of period integrals has made us acquainted 
with two major aspects of conservation. They are the local and the global 
aspects of conservation. The local conservation is mathematically conveyed 
by a vanishing exterior derivative, which is merely an invariant transcrip­
tion of the familiar continuity equations of physics, which usually invoke 
divergence expressions. Global conservation, by contrast, is conveyed by 
everywhere vanishing cyclic integrals. Global and local conservation tend 
to go hand in hand, in the sense that global conservation indeed implies 
local conservation. Yet, local conservation cannot, in general, be called 
upon to infer global conservation. Hence, global conservation is the 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
111
stronger of the two statements. A closed form may have domains with 
everywhere vanishing exterior derivative; yet this fact does not permit an 
inference of universal global conservation. The nonzero residues testify to 
a conditional conservation associated with closed forms. Exactness, by 
contrast, testifies to a universal absence of field sources, everywhere in the 
spacetime universe. Hence, exactness, as an expression of global 
conservation, is the more encompassing criterion of conservation.
The here-given criteria for universal conservation work fine for the 
familiar conservation of electric charge, which is expressed by the 
exactness of the 3-form C. It is slightly less common to speak of the 
conservation of flux, because it requires lumping together magnetic and 
electric flux. Yet seen in this context, Faraday's law of induction is to be 
regarded as an expression of universal flux conservation, as expressed by 
the exactness of the 2-form F. The proposition of magnetic monopoles 
clearly would make F a closed form, which is no longer globally derivable 
from a one-form R. While flux and charge relate to the exactness of 2 and 
3-forms, one may now ask whether any meaningful physical conservation 
is known relating to 1- and 4-forms.
An exact one-form is everywhere derivable from a spacetime scalar 
permeating all of the universe. However, this spacetime scalar is only 
defined modulo an exact part. This exact part has a vanishing exterior 
derivative (4-dimensional gradient); its gauge thus becomes a constant of 
integration. An inadequate example of an exact one-form is the energy­
momentum vector, which in Hamilton-Jacobi theory is taken to be 
derivable from a spacetime scalar. Physical limitations of this H-J process 
are discussed in the next section.
The exact 4-form in spacetime has other features, which reveal a new 
aspect of global conservation without a local counter part. An exact 4- 
form would have to be the exterior derivative of a 3-form. The Lagrangian 
4-form of action, as given by Eq. 18 of section 3, is a striking example. 
This 4-form
L = 
= FzsG + AzT 
22
meets the requirements of exactness, which according to the general rules 
would translate into global conservation. Yet, the corresponding integral 
expression of this conservation can only be made explicit for the totality of 
a spacetime M4, which for this purpose would have to be cyclic. A 
conservation statement, which is necessarily extended over the totality of a 
cyclic spacetime, is indeed of limited local usefulness.
A complication for local action conservation is that the exterior deriva­
tive of a 4-form defined in a four-dimensional space is trivially zero: 
dLsO. The reason is that permutations of four variables over five positions 

112
CHAPTER VI
necessarily invoke a repeat of at least one variable. This repeat reduces 
an antisymmetric quantity identically to zero. Hence, there is no realistic 
prospect of any usable form of local action conservation, whereas a univer­
sal formulation of a global action conservation remains very impractical.
The just-stated conclusion reflects on the absence of a consensus in 
physics on whether or not there is such a thing as action conservation. 
There are meaningful expressions for flux and charge conservation. 
Mindful of the impossibility of local-action conservation, the question is 
whether conditional statements of global conservation are more practical 
than statements invoking the whole universe. Here is a possibility:
The period integrals of S open up a possibility of singling out so-called 
action isolated (or perhaps we should say action-adiabatic) global systems. 
If S is of the form given by
S=A/XG, 
23
the period integral Eq. 15 of this chapter can be optionally regarded as an 
isolated case of global action conservation that is "locally" specified 
through the cycle C3:____________________________________________
A Theorem of Action Adiabaticity
The action residues of the integral
L (A^G) = kh, withk=l,2..., 
24
1 c3
selected by the cycles c3, represent globally conserved action.____________
Eq. 24 is, of course, identical with Eq.15 of section 3 of this chapter.
They constitute, by virtue of this fact, a legitimate statement of a semi- 
globally conserved action, such as selected by the cyclic-integration domain 
C3 pertaining to the physical configuration that is being considered. 
Through the specifics of the selection of the residue cycle c3, action 
conservation in the form of Eq.23 has acquired a pronounced system 
related connotation. There is no longer a universal global conservation that 
holds for all cycles, such as in the cases of flux and charge; instead there is 
a system-related conditional global conservation. A realistic physical 
example of such a system-based semi-global conservation is the current 
carrying superconducting ring discussed in the next chapter.
If L is not of the form of Eq.22, no statements about a system-related 
action conservation can be made. Instead, the system is then in an action 
exchange with its environment, and may be said to seek an action 
extremum adjustment. The ensuing variational Lagrangian, written in the 
now more familiar tensor form, is:
25
The Lagrangians of Eqs. 22 and 25 may look alike, yet the factor 1/2 
makes a significant difference. Unlike Eq.22, the Lagrangian of Eq.25 is 

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
113
not the exterior derivative of a 3-form. In tensor language it says the 
Lagrangian of Eq.25 is not the divergence of the contravariant 4-vector 
density which defines the 3-form A^G. Lagrangians of the form 
of Eq.25 are relevant for obtaining equations of motion of charges moving 
in an external B field, instead of in an internally produced mutual B field 
of a superconducting ring.
If L is a pure divergence, Stokes' theorem would make the variational 
process trivial, such as is the case for the L defined by Eq.22. In fact many 
Lagrangians used in physics are of the trivial type. The Lagrangian of the 
free-space electromagnetic field is an example; even so the variational 
derivative still retains its usefulness for obtaining the d'Alembert wave 
equation. We are thus confronted with two types of Lagrangians, which 
should be given different names. They are:
I The action conservation Lagrangian defined by Eq.22.
II The action variational Lagrangian defined by Eq.25.
Cases I and II mutually exclude one another. They lead to the following 
alternative:^__________________________________________________
Alternative of Action Variation versus Conservation
If case I (Eq.22) prevails, the variational process becomes trivial and 
action is semi-globally conserved. If case II (Eq.25) prevails, the varia­
tional process is not trivial. Action now seeks an extremum adjustment. 
Hence, action balance takes the place of action conservation in case II.
Case I can occur only if the sources of all (external) fields can be 
accounted for in terms of residues of S, so as to make them internal fields. 
The choice between between cases I and II is in some ways a matter of 
practicality. Recall hereto the example in chapter VII of Larmor 
circulation, which can be seen as one half of the electrons performing 
cyclotron orbits in the field of the other half.
8. 
A de Rham Perspective on Schroediger's Equation
More than most other pioneers of quantum mechanics, Schroedinger 
remained skeptical about the interpretations that were beginning to emerge 
in the early thirties. While he was quite forthcoming and verbal about his 
reservations, he did not succeed in convincing his fellow physicists to share 
his doubts. Schroedinger was concerned about an unreasonable aura of 
miracle with which the Copenhagen School was beginning to surround the 
newly founded formalism. Today, several decades later, it can be said that 
de Rham's theorems on closed and exact forms hold some good promise to 
substantiate and clarify Schroedinger's own doubts about his own miracle.
At the time of the exchange between Schroedinger and the Copenhagen 
School, the theorems of de Rham were just beginning to establish a position 
of importance in the world of mathematics. There is a subtlety of concept 

114
CHAPTER VI
in these theorems, because they initiate a new phase of mathematical 
awareness concerning the use of local and global aspects.
De Rham's theorems are, if you will, a natural dimensional extension of 
the Cauchy theorems of complex analysis. From the two-dimensional 
complex domain, the concepts of analyticity are extended to real manifolds 
of arbitrary dimension with the help of the concepts of closed and exact. If 
complex variable theory initiated a concern about the topology of singu­
larities, de Rham theory similarly initiated a concern about the topology of 
the domains of support for the closed and exact properties of differential 
forms. Note that the point-singularities of complex variable theory can, in 
the de Rham case, assume finite manifestations covering extended domains.
Even half a century after their inception, de Rham's theorems have not 
yet been incorporated as an integral part of mathematical physics. The 
stumbling block has been an uncertainty in conclusively identifying the 
physical nature of spacetime's topological obstructions separating analyti­
cally distinct domains. Yet some of the very ideas that led to these theo­
rems derive from physics. Let us examine here how de Rham's theorems 
directly affect Schroedinger's transcription that led him to his wave equa­
tion by starting from Hamilton-Jacobi theory.
Schroedinger used the transcription of (Hamilton) de Broglie 
eiUJ(qA,t)/h ->^(q\t), 
26
in which tjr is the Schroedinger wave function and UU is the Hamilton- 
Jacobi action, both as functions of space coordinates qA (A = 1,2,3..) and 
time t. Schroedinger arrived at his wave equation by taking the variational 
derivative of the Hamiltonian written as a function of qr and its derivatives.
The essence of the now following arguments centers around the precise 
specifications concerning the global nature of the action function HI, which 
in turn affects the global properties of the wave function The de Rham 
theorems are essential for reassessing the mathematical conscience about W 
and • For this purpose, it suffices to take h = 1.
In general, neither lb nor can be expected to be single-valued. 
Schroedinger's favor of fortune, as Weyl called it, is the miracle of a 
procedure, which by imposing global conditions of square integrability and 
single-valuedness on yields important physical results.
Let us examine from an angle of de Rham theory the (one-particle) 
Hamilton-Jacobi equation of analytic dynamics:
3UJ
= H(p,q,t), with p=- gradW , 
27
the wave function is predicated by the existence of a spacetime scalar 
function W satisfying Eq.27. An indication of the local existence of lb is

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
115
provided by the Hamilton equations of motion, because they ascertain the 
local integrability of the Pfaffian defined by the spacetime energy­
momentum one-form (compare Eqs. 9 and 10 of section 3 of this chapter):
R = dUJ = Hdt-pxdq* . 
28
Eq.28 depicts this differential form as the exterior derivative of the 
spacetime scalar function 10.
It suffices, for the sake of this argument, if a single particle situation is 
considered, with summation over A=1,2,3., because it facilitates a 
spacetime physical identification. For point-particles, H and pA appear 
physically as components of a spacetime four-vector "field"; they are not 
just defined on a given trajectory. This "field" can be strung together into 
families of world-line trajectories. Since distinct trajectories intersect at a 
single the field 10 must be multi-valued and so are Pa-
If Eq.28 is taken in the global sense, which is a prerequisite for 
applying de Rham's second theorem, it follows that the energy-momentum 
one-form would have to be exact. This exactness, in the de Rham sense, 
implies according to the same theorem that all cyclic integrals of R vanish:
|c R =0 for all Cj . 
29
Yet physical experiences from the classical, as well as quantum aspects, tell 
us that Eq.29 cannot be unconditionally met. The Bohr-Sommerfeld 
integrals
fR-»|pdq = nh ; n = 1,2,.... 
30
provide tangible and familiar evidence that Eq.29 can't possibly vanish for 
all cycles Cj. The contradiction between Eqs.29 and 30 translates into a 
conclusion that the action 1-form is closed but not exact (i.e., dR=0, but 
Eq.29 does not hold for all Ci). The latter fact automatically activates 
de Rham's first theorem for those cycles for which Eq.29 does not vanish. 
By the same token it deactivates de Rham's second theorem.
It follows that the lb function of Hamilton-Jacobi does not meet the 
condition of single-valuedness required by de Rham's second theorem. 
Hence there is no single-valued LU, such that the energy-momentum one- 
form is everywhere defined by dUU. From a global point of view, one 
should also consider that a closed form, unlike an exact form, is 
only determined modulo an exact part!
Without a single-valued lb, the chances of having a single-valued are 
not very good. The question is whether imposing conditions of single- 
valuedness on is possible at all. The saving grace for rescue from this 
predicament is truly in the "wave" nature of the de Broglie-inspired tran­
scription recipe of Eq.26, which was used by Schroedinger. This tran­
scription permits the conversion of an inherently multi-valued w into an 

116
CHAPTER VI
optionally single-valued . The recipe of square integrability and single- 
valuedness indeed singles out the optionally single-valued solutions corre­
sponding to unique quantum states.
Seen in this perspective, it is an amazing but pleasant surprise that the 
Schroedinger process is capable of retrieving earlier results resembling the 
Bohr-Sommerfeld process. First we saw that the Bohr-Sommerfeld 
integrals were incompatible with a globally defined single-valued action 
function ID. Then we attempt to conceal this multi-valuedness with the help 
of the transcription of Eq.26, and subsequently we end up finding an 
optionally selectable single-valuedness of which, amazingly, reproduces 
Bohr-Sommerfeld results, at least in an asymptotic sense (compare hereto 
the WBK approximation).
What is the physical implication of that Schroedinger detour for 
obtaining those slightly different quantum states? Before an answer to this 
question is attempted, let us just rephrase the procedures that have been 
here described from an unconventional angle. It is necessary to give the 
convolutedness of the scheme a chance for sinking in.
From the Hamilton-Jacobi angle, an assigning of nonzero values to 
certain action integrals corresponds to selecting families of solutions 
with specific physical properties. An example is the family of elliptical 
orbits for planetary motion covering the annular-shaped orbital manifold 
by giving the integrals $R fixed values. A continuous change of the values 
assigned to these integrals f A selects a continuum of new orbital families. 
When, instead, the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum conditions are imposed on 
these integrals, the continuum of orbital families now shrinks to a discrete 
set of orbital families.
Yet each of these discrete quantum families still has a continuum of 
orbital options. For the planetary motion it is the choice of orientation of 
orbital plane and the position of orbital perihelion. For the harmonic 
oscillator it is orientation and time of zero amplitude or phase, which was 
exactly the object of Planck's averaging process that led him to the 
introduction of zero-point energy (see chapter III; 5).
The next point of concern involves the transcription of Eq.26. It brings 
the multi-valued nature of the action function UU in a latent state. 
Schroedinger’s recipe of single-valuedness for the wave function 
retrieves asymptotically the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum discreteness. The 
statistical implications of now indicate a family averaging 
over the still-available phases and orientations of each family 
of orbits compatible with the given quantum state. Schroedinger’s 
"detour" is thus shown to bring about a phase averaging, which is exactly 
what led Planck to the need for an ensemble-based zero-point energy.

PERIOD INTEGRALS: A UNIVERSAL TOOL OF PHYSICS
117
The presented delineation between Bohr-Sommerfeld and Schroedinger 
procedures becomes, in fact, an attempt at a synthesis-oriented counterpart 
of the more traditional analytic wave-* ray asymptotics that goes back to 
Hamilton. While the wave-* ray procedure favors the Schroedinger process 
as more fundamental, the de Rham-based synthesis, by contrast, gives no 
reason to support that conjecture. Instead, it reinstates fundamental 
qualities of the Bohr-Sommerfeld process.
It is now possible to gain new insight into the physical implications of 
the Schroedinger process. Since the the Hamilton-Jacobi action function W, 
as specified by the B-S integrals, represents a family of equivalent quantum 
orbits. By virtue of the transcription of Eq.l, the wave function ty, also 
represents that family of selected orbits, which leads to a
Proposition of Equivalence
The variational process used by Schroedinger on a Hamilton-Jacobi-type 
Lagrangian translates into a statistical equilibrium in a family of Hamilton- 
Jacobi orbits that are equivalent from a Bohr-Sommerfeld angle.
In other words: the Copenhagen suggestion of fuzzy orbits is 
herewith replaced by a statistical ensemble of actually 
conceivable orbits. Hence, the next question has to be: What are the 
options of physical interpretation for those Hamilton-Jacobi families? Since 
each element of these orbital families is known to represent a physically 
possible dynamic situation from a so-called classical angle, there really is 
no longer an adequate reason to hide behind an indeterminate nonclassical 
picture. The one and only remaining nonclassical quantum feature is the 
discreteness of orbital families. So abandoning the nonclassical fuzzy orbit 
escape, we now have only two major possibilities of interpretation:
I: The ’’Classical" Copenhagen Option
The B-S discrete families of H-J solutions can be thought of as 
ensembles of conceivable manifestations of one-and-the-same physical 
system in the sense of Gibbs. This would be the single-system option of the 
Copenhagen interpretation, yet, without a need for calling on a nonclassical 
statistics.
II: The Ensemble Option
The other possibility is to consider each B-S family of H-J solutions as 
an actual physical ensemble, whereby each orbit of the family represents 
the performance of a distinct physical element of an ensemble of identical 
physical elements.

118
CHAPTER VI
Interpretation II was suggested by Popper in 1934; it is 
known as the statistical or ensemble interpretation. Seen from 
this common Hamilton-Jacobi origin of I and II, the Copenhagen 
interpretation visualizes the H-J orbital manifold in the vein of 
Gibbs' abstract ensemble of conceivable manifestations of one 
and the same single system. It explains, if you will, why many 
contemporary discussions indeed vacillate between physical 
ensemble and single-system views.
Since this quanta reprogramming has accumulated evidence, supporting 
an ensemble view of the Schroedinger process, it is now opportune to 
mention that Gibbs' single system abstraction was an artifact substituting 
system manifestation plurality for actual system plurality. The statistics for 
cases I and II are the same and perfectly classical, because their universe of 
discourse is the same; they are the phase-and-orientation parameters in the 
orbital manifold determined by the Hamilton-Jacobi process. The Gibbs 
artifact of conceivable manifestations is now responsible for Copenhagen's 
single-system extrapolation with the single system as a carrier of a 
universal always-present zero-point energy. The physical viability of the 
Copenhagen view has reached here its most vulnerable position.
Schroedinger never denied that his brainchild was a favor of fortune. 
He maintained the Copenhagen School was rushing into premature judg­
ment. Copenhagen inspired action thus won out by default, because 
Schroedinger's denunciation was not followed by a counter action that 
could sway the public opinion in physics away from the Copenhagen path 
of nonclassical mystique. When initiated by Popper, a small minority 
propagated ensemble views in the Thirties. Most of this minority silently 
adhered to many of the Copenhagen nonclassical precepts. It meant the 
Copenhagen point of view was really never in great danger of being 
overruled by facts or logic.
Now, however, a de Rham view on the Schroedinger process 
unambiguously identifies phase and orientation as ensemble 
parameters. Since these parameters have no intrinsic signifi­
cance for the dynamical performance of isolated single systems 
(except for the purpose of establishing initial conditions), it 
follows that the phase and orientation of a single system can 
acquire a physical role if, and only if, they partake in nonlocal 
environmental dynamical exchange; say, with neighbor systems. 
This evidence shows mutual-phase and mutual-orientation as 
nonlocal parameters of system-interaction in the ensemble. 
These findings conclusively rule out any possibility of accepting 
the Schroedinger process as a single system tool, such as is 
intimated by the Copenhagen interpretation (option I).

CHAPTER VII
LARMOR AND CYCLOTRON ASPECTS OF FLUX QUANTA
1. Summary
Flux quanta h/2e relate to a system with electrons circulating at the 
Larmor rate in their self-field. Quanta h/e are linked by an orbital 
electron motion circulating at the cyclotron rate in an external magnetic 
field. The Larmor situation corresponds to a seemingly exact 1-form 
p=mv-eA of energy-momentum with perfect angular momentum balance 
between mechanical and field angular momentum. The cyclotron motion, 
by contrast, relates to a closed 1-form p, and invokes an explicit action 
exchange with the external field environment.
2. Larmor Circulation in Superconducting Rings
When in the early Sixties German and American teams 1 proved the 
existence of flux quantization in superconducting rings, the size of the 
observed quanta turned out, surprisingly, to be half of what was expected 
on the basis of Fritz London's earlier prediction of this phenomenon. A 
Letter by Onsager,2 which appeared simultaneously with the letters 
reporting the experimental verification, related the factor "two" to the 
electron pairing demanded by the theory of superconductivity.
A vivid account of these events can be found in the last part of the third 
volume of the Feynman Lectures.3 The reader will note that Onsager's 
dictum of that Factor Two elicits a Feynman footnote explaining that only 
Onsager understood the given argument for justification.
Since neither Onsager nor Feynman are with us any longer to help us 
out of this controversy, let us proceed by paraphrasing a Shakespearean 
admonition that perhaps, also in physics, the beauty of understanding can 
be dominated by the eye of the beholder. The objective of this chapter 
aims at some further insight into this Onsager-Feynman controversy by 
looking at the issue as part of a generation gap in physics. Onsager came 
of age prior to the quantum revolution of the late Twenties, whereas 
Feynman grew up with modem quantum mechanics as the new gospel of 
physics.
119

120
CHAPTER VII
Let us attempt here to resolve these questions in the spirit of a Bohr- 
Sommerfeld approach to quantization. Such a semiclassical argument may 
have been closer to the thinking of Onsager. Over the past half century, an 
appeal to the earlier tools of quantum mechanics had to be argued with the 
utmost of care so as not to create a credibility gap. A circumspect 
treatment will be desirable to avoid opening up a can of worms.
In the light of the preceding chapter, the following simple thoughts may 
be able to cast some light on this situation. Consider a reasonably slender 
superconducting ring of radius r. Let s be the number of electrons 
circulating in this ring, creating a flux through the interior. The 
cooperative nature of superconductivity suggests that all s electrons 
circulate in the ring at the same rate. Although theory indicates s to be an 
even number, let us see, for the sake of argument, whether this conclusion 
can follow here directly from observation.
The total energy E associated with the superconducting ring situation 
consists of the sum of the kinetic energy Ek of s circulating electrons and 
the magnetic energy Em created by the circulating current
E = E|< + Em . 
1
If m is the electronic mass and co the common rate of circulation
Ek = (1/2)smr2co2 , 
2
and if J is the total ring current and <I> the ring-enclosed flux
Em = (1 /2)<bJ . 
3
A comparison of the two energy components requires further 
knowledge of co . Consider hereto the electron's momentum expression 
p=mv-eA, in which v = co x r and R is the vector potential. Using 
London's recipe of curlp = 0 as characterizing the superconducting state, 
and noting that curLv - 2co, one obtains for co the Larmor frequency:
co = (e/2m)B , 
4
B = curl A is the magnetic induction, e is the electronic charge.
An application of Stokes' theorem to the ring configuration leads quite 
generally to an effective magnitude B = | B governed by the relation
R =(1/2) r B , 
5
A curl-free p can be gauged to vanish. This leads to mv = efi, which with 
the help of Eq.5 and v= cor reconfirms Eq.4.
It is now possible to prove that
E|< = Em • 
6
Let us hereto transcribe the kinetic energy using the flux expression O 
=tcr2B;
Ek = s(1/2)mr2co2 = s(1/2)n'r2Bmco2/n'B = (1/2)<I>smco2/'n'B,

LARMOR AND CYCLOTRON ASPECTS OF FLUX QUANTA
121
now using Eq.4 the last part transcribes as
E|< = (1/2)C> seco/27T = (1/2)C>J, 
7
because the ring current J is by definition:
J = seao/2iT . 
8
This proves Eq.6, and the total energy may thus be written as
E = <P J . 
9
Quantization can now be introduced through the experimentally 
established formula
<D = n h/2e ; (flux quantum h/2e is unit for self-field), 
10
where n=l,2,.. is the flux quantum number. Substitution in Eq.9 gives
E = (s/2)nhco/2jr = (s/2) nbo> . 
11
Eq. 11 indicates that electrons assume pair-wise the energy nba). This 
conclusion is a direct consequence of the experimentally observed 
quantization of Eq. 10 and therefore confirms Onsager's dictum.
Starting from the angular-momentum expression L = smr2oo one now 
easily finds, with the help of a similar transcription, that
L = (s/2)nh , 
12
again confirming as a consequence of Eqs.4 and 10 that electrons assume 
pair-wise the value nti.
The magnetic moment p associated with the ring current can now be 
obtained either by using the experimentally established orbital gyro- 
magnetic ratio e/2m, or by a transcription of the formula p =rtr2J with the 
help Eqs.4,8,10 and 12, both leading to
p = (s/2)n(e/2m)b, 
13
i.e., a magnetic moment that is a multiple n of the magneton unit (e/2m)b 
per electron pair.
Hence, as a consequence of the experimentally observed flux quanta 
h/2e, as given by Eq. 10, both ring energy and magnetic moment give 
unified testimony of the electron pairing in the superconducting process.
Having established the basic feature of the electron pairing 
as a consequence of experimental observation and the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld conditions, one could, in retrospect, say that one- 
half of the electrons is circulating in the field generated by the 
other half. Since one-half of the electrons generate only half the B field, 
the situation can now be summarized as follows: with both halves of the 
electrons circulating at the Larmor rate in the total B field, 
each half may be said to perform a cyclotron circulation in the 
B field generated by the other half. The Onsager pairing thus 
provides added insight into the relation between Larmor and cyclotron 
frequencies.

3. Angular Momentum Balance in Superconducting Rings
How is angular momentum conserved in superconducting rings? If an 
increase in temperature kills the supercurrent in a ring, where does the 
momentum of the charge carriers go? A tempting answer is that the 
electrons start colliding with the lattice of the ring material, thus causing a 
transfer of a conceivably observable momentum to the material of the ring.
There is, however, another mechanism that could well prevail over the 
just-mentioned collision process. As soon as the charge carrier motion 
slows down, the ensuing change in magnetic flux produces an electromotive 
force, counteracting the retardation of the motion. Moreover, an opposite 
torque acts on the opposite charges of the lattice. It thus follows that the 
angular motion of the charge carriers exchanges momentum with the mag­
netic field it generates. It is reasonable to endow the surrounding magnetic 
field with a magnitude of angular momentum. It also seems reasonable to 
assume that this field momentum will vanish simultaneously with the me­
chanical momentum if the charge carriers come to rest. So, how much of 
the momentum is exchanged with the lattice of the superconductor? and 
how much is exchanged with the self-field of the ring?
Here is a good opportunity to test Eq. 15 of chapter VI in a macroscopic 
situation. Eq.7 of chapter VIII gives an application in the submicroscopic 
domain, let us try here an application in the macro- or, better, the 
mesoscopic domain. Since the field formula is supposed to apply for orbital 
as well as spin angular-momentum, let us write Lf for this "orbitally"- 
related field momentum and use the flux unit h/2e instead of h/e for its 
evaluation. One thus obtains via Eqs. 12,14 and 15 of chapter VI and 
Kuennetz rule:
Lf=f fl I G=n(h/2e)se = (s/2)nh, 
12a
Tc, Tc2
which is to be compared with the L of Eq. 12 for the mechanical of the 
charge carriers. It follows that Lf=2irL. The factor 2tc is characteristic of
orbital integration over Ci , as distinguished from a spinorial 4rc double 
loop circulation encountered for the trefoil electron model in chapter VIII.
The 2it thus stems from the customary differential definition of orbital 
angular momentum, p^ = mr2co, which is an action prior to the loop in­
tegration. Hence,
2tt
Lf = Jp<j>d4>
0
equals the angle-integrated mechanical angular momentum.
Eqs. 12 and 12a say that the action integral of the mechanical angular 
momentum equals the field angular momentum, because the latter is 

LARMOR AND CYCLOTRON ASPECTS OF FLUX QUANTA
123
already in the action-integrated form. So going through the transition 
temperature energy is not conserved, but action is globally conserved 
between charge carriers and the field they generate. The lattice has no role 
as a buffer.
4. Flux Quanta Linked by Cyclotron Orbits
Now, by contrast, a single electron circulating in an external magnetic 
field is, strictly speaking, not a closed system, even if the situation, as 
depicted, is conservative. According to Landau, its quantized energy states 
change in discrete orbital steps h a> per single electron. Higher quantum 
states thus correspond to increased orbital radii r, with accordingly 
increased kinetic energy. The question can be asked: how much flux of the 
external magnetic field is linked by a given cyclotron orbit?
The following Bohr-Sommerfeld-based argument can provide an 
answer to this question. If, in the previous case, the cyclic integral of the 
one-form defined by the momentum p was taken to vanish: | p = 0, this 
conclusion no longer holds when the electron is circulating in an external 
field. Instead, one has for the circular orbit:
£p<l>d<t> = ^moor2d<t> - § eRrd<t> = nh, n = 1,2,... . 
14
Since the equation of motion in a field B now yields for a> a circulation at 
the rate of the cyclotron frequency:
co = (e/m) B , 
15
an evaluation of Eq. 14, with the help of Eqs.5 and 15, gives
2-nT2 B e-nr2 B e = nr2 B e = n h.
In other words, the flux intercepted by an electron orbit circulating in an 
external field B is quantized according to:
C>=nh/e ; (h/e flux unit for external field) n=l,2,.. 
16
The result of Eq. 16 is obtainable from the Landau states, provided the 
zero-point energy is taken not to contribute to the orbital radius. The 
orbital flux interception in the quantum Hall effect obeys Eq. 16. There is, 
as shown in chapter III; 6, conclusive experimental evidence to justify the 
absence of a zero-point term in Eqs.10 and 16. Eq.16 is the key to an 
extremely simple description of the fractional quantum Hall effect.^
What is the message of these simple considerations? It seems that the 
Bohr-Sommerfeld procedure has, in the present context, a potentially 
unique feature, which cannot quite be duplicated by quantum mechanics in 
its current form. The Bohr-Sommerfeld method, in conjunction with 
Hamilton-Jacobi theory, imposes on us greater awareness of a physical 
delineation between closed and exact differential forms. Only in ad hoc 
situations has gauge theory so far awakened to this distinction. There is as 
yet in physics no systematic incorporation of these concepts.

124
CHAPTER VII
Mathematically, closed and exact forms are locally indistinguishable. 
They only differ globally in that an exact form has always-vanishing cyclic 
integrals, whereas the closed form can have nonzero cyclic integrals. The 
postulated existence of an action function UJ from which p is derivable, 
with lb obeying the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation, makes p 
exact according to a theorem by de Rham.5 The self-field situation of the 
superconducting ring meets this condition of exactness for p by virtue of 
London's equations for superconductivity. Yet the electron orbiting in an 
external field does not meet that requirement, because now there is a 
^>p*o; yet a W still locally exists. Within those constraints, the Hamilton- 
Jacobi process and the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization have proven to still 
retain a measure of relevance (e.g., Sommerfeld's analysis of the hydrogen 
fine-structure in chapter X).
The standard "partial" rationale leading to the Schroedinger equation 
is, of course, affected by this unresolved status of the one form p between 
closed and exact. It is not obvious whether this state of indecision between 
closed and exact can be helpful in maintaining, for the Schroedinger 
equation, the status of being a fundamental tool of physics.
Offhand, it is unlikely that a wave-equation approach, which is local in 
nature, would be able to accommodate, at all times, the intrinsically 
nonlocal characteristics revealed in mesoscopic quamtum situations. The 
conditions of wave function uniqueness and square integrability, though 
global in nature, can't be expected to make up for all the lacunar global 
structure of standard theory.
5. Energy Considerations
It is of interest to note that the quantization nhoo for the harmonic 
oscillators in a superconducting ring applies to electron pairs including 
their magnetic self-energy. The energy E for N electron pairs in the ring is 
the sum of kinetic energy of the N pairs and the magnetic field energy
E = N mr2co2 + (i/2)OJ= N nboo; n=l,2,3,......... 17
Substitution of the current for N pairs J= N2eoo/27T gives
E = N (mr2w2 + d>eGo/27T).
Using the expressions for the Larmor frequency and the quantization of the 
self-generated flux, there is no problem in confirming Eqs. 1 and 6. Note 
also that the result is compatible with an equal magnitude mechanical- and 
field energy per pair of 2mr2oo = 2eC>/2tT = n b (spin terms cancel).
The cyclotron situation can be treated in a similar manner. The kinetic 
energy for s electrons in cyclotron orbit is

125
E|< = (1/2)smr2ao2
with an associated magnetic interaction energy which does not get the fac­
tor 1/2:
Em= J.
For s electrons in the cyclotron orbit J = seao/2TT, and now using the 
expression for the cyclotron frequency it is not hard to show that
E^ = E jp “ s n co.
Even s is here demanded by the Pauli principle. Hence, also here the spin 
terms cancel.

CHAPTER VHI
FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS
1. Summary
The following further illustrates how period integrals produce answers 
in nonstatistical situations. Since new methods, when they are compared 
with traditional approaches, always appear apocryphal at first, a measure 
of reconditioning must be expected. More leisurely discussions follow in 
chapters IX and XI to show the relation to familiar treatments in physics.
2. The Electron's Anomalous Moment
Mathematics enjoys a privileged position insofar as some of its devel­
opments seem to be purely cerebral without an obligatory confrontation 
with physical reality. Of course, there remain requirements of meeting the 
reality of logical consistency, which somehow is part of physical reality. 
The fact is, however, that mathematics can keep coasting on abstractions 
and their inner consistency much longer than physics.
Many developments in modem topology indeed are living testimony to 
the veracity of such typical differences between physics and mathematics. 
Mindful that a topological assessment of physics cannot be just an exercise 
in the creation of freewheeling abstractions, a frequent confrontation with 
observed facts is necessary to guide the conceptualization into realistic 
avenues.
Many of the now-known macroscopic quantum effects have been found 
to provide a useful realm of investigation, because they have the advantage 
of something that comes closest to what may be called a visualization. 
Examples are: flux quantization in superconducting rings, the Josephson 
effects, different versions of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the integer and 
fractional quantized Hall effect, the neutron diffraction experiments in 
gravitational fields and, more recently, the single particle diffraction 
experiments.
To the extent that these effects have still been somewhat describable by 
standard quantum procedures, wave-function uniqueness is found to assume 
a central role. Since uniqueness relates to wave-function phase, as
126

FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS
127
described by the Aharonov-Bohm integral, questions of how to decide 
between flux units h/2e and h/e take center stage.
In the previous chapter, self-generated fields in conjunction with 
electron pairing were found to relate to the period integral status of Eq. 12 
of chapter VI, whereas a period integral status of Eq. 13 of chapter VI was 
taken to relate to external magnetic fields. An application of the latter 
though is directly contingent on whether or not the participating particles 
have a field-free interior. For particles to accumulate in the same quantum 
state, boson pairing is also here essential.
Since it is not easily possible to probe directly into particle interiors, an 
indirect way of checking the feasibility of the field-free interior proposi­
tion is by testing models that are postulated to have a field-free interior. 
Hence, the applications of chapter Vi's Eqs. 12-15 are contingent on particle 
constitution. All this is to remind us that the macroscopic manifestations of 
matter are inseparable from its microscopic nature. Since the electron is a 
major protagonist in almost all situations, an electron model with a field- 
free interio permitting application of the Aharonov-Bohm period integrals, 
is next on the agenda. The model should, over and above, account for 
gyro-magnetic anomaly, and the half-integer differential spin.
Since the electron has a magnetic moment, it is taken to have a flux 
quantum h/e for the following reason. For the "trefoil" model, to be ex­
plained later, the charge e/2 moves in the field generated by the other 
e/2, which in the end justifies Eq.13 of chapter VI with n=l (z.e., chapter 
VI, Eq. 12 for the charge e/2). Furthermore, its electric charge is governed 
by chapter Vi's Eq. 14 for s=l, and its (integrated) spin by chapter Vi's 
Eq.15 for k=l (please note k=l not k=l/2, as will be discussed shortly).
To produce a flux and corresponding magnetic moment, the model has 
to be some sort of a ring of circulating charge. A simple ring, which has 
been tried many times, must be rejected, because it has a spatial center of 
symmetry, which is not acceptable for a charged particle. To avoid the 
spatial center of symmetry, and to account for charge polarity as a 
manifestation of spatial enantiomorphism, the electron ring shall be thought 
of as a knotted ring, also known as a "trefoil." Similarly, as electron and 
positron, left and right trefoil are adjoined under orientation-changing 
spatial transformations. This double ring is visualized in Fig.2 as a tube 
with a field-free interior; the result of a submicroscopic Meissner effect, if 
you will. The internal cycle q of the double ring is the integration loop 
for chapter Vi's Eqs. 12 andl3; it closes after a 4k circulation and not after 
a 2k circulation. From a spacetime point of view, the "trefoil" is a 
constant time slice of a Jordan-Brouwer hypersurface of charge.
These are the model specifications that suffice to make at least a first­
and second-order calculation of the electron properties. The mass m of the 

128
CHAPTER VIII
electron is taken to be determined by the volume integrals of the field 
energies E-D/2 and H-B/2 and the matter related contributions A-J/2 and 
pV/2. Standard theory yields (see Eq.9 of chapterVI, or Eq.2, p.66 in 
ref.2 of chapterVI of this text):
me2 = C>J + eV. 
1
The last term in Eq.l is the electrostatic energy of the familiar Lorentz 
model with e determined by chapter Vi's Eq. 14 for s=l. In accordance 
with the necessarily dynamic nature of elementary charge, the Lorentz 
term is here augmented with the (much bigger) magnetic energy term <DJ, 
in which O is the elementary flux linked by the trefoil and determined by 
chapter Vi's Eq. 13 for n=l, whereas J is the total ring current.
Recalling the predicament of stabilizing the Lorentz electron with 
Poincare stresses, this dynamically extended Lorentz model, by contrast, 
provides those stresses naturally in the form of the Ampere forces acting 
between the two halves of the trefoil ring (see chapter XI; 5). There is an 
asymptotic equilibrium between the repelling Coulomb forces and the 
attracting Ampere forces if the charge of the tubular charge sheath of the 
trefoil approaches a circulation speed equal to the vacuum speed of light. 
Since electric charge belongs in Cartan's pre-metric Maxwellian realm, 
charge moving at the speed of light does not violate metric-based 
restrictions, for which the speed of light is an upper bound. Compare this 
argument with the speed of light argument used for the Zitterbewegung in 
chapter XI; 8. Note also that charge is a primary concept, whereas mass has 
a derived status via the concept of energy. Mass, unlike charge, is not of a 
distributed nature, its system-based definition gives it a global property, 
subject to metric restrictions of the special theory.
Further metric properties can now be injected. For an effective trefoil 
radius r, the magnetic moment p of the electron may be represented by the 
familiar expression:
P = 7Tr2J 
2
Since, for reasons of model stability, the vacuum speed of light c is 
favored for the azimuthal motion of the charge sheath circulating around 
the trefoil ring (chapter XI; 5), the total ring current J and ring radius r 
are then related by
J = e/(27Tr/c). 
3
Elimination of r between Eqs.2 and 3 gives
p = e2c2/(4TTJ). 
4
Now eliminating J between Eqs.l and 4 yields a familiar looking 
expression for the magnetic moment
(e/m)(h/4ir)
= (1-eV/mc2) ' 
5
which for eV«mc2 approaches the magnetic moment of a Dirac electron.

FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS
129
It thus follows OJ » eV, which means the electron (according to this 
model) consists mostly of magnetic energy. The electrostatic energy merely 
gives rise to a small anomaly in the moment of the Dirac electron. This 
correction term can be related to an impedance ratio.
The ratio V/J has the dimension of an impedance, which might be called 
the surface impedance Zs of the trefoil. Solving Eq.l for the current J then 
gives
J = mc2/( <b + eZs ). 
6
Substitution of Eq.6 in Eq.4 yields for the moment p. the alternate 
expression
p = (e/m)(h/4rr)[l + Zs/(h/e2)J. 
5a
The correction term assumes the familiar first order term ar/2rr of QED 
if Zs equals the omni-directional vacuum impedance: Zs = (1 /4tt)-^p0/e0 . 
Such a matching of impedances is, if you will, a stability enhancing feature. 
Note how the fine structure constant a manifests itself here as a ratio of 
two by now very familiar impedances: a = e2/2h)'7p0/e0 • The impedance 
h/e2 has assumed a prominent role in the quantum Hall effect, whereas 
the vacuum impedance has now had a role for some time in important 
radar "engineering" applications.
Except for the spin, the period integral description of the electron is 
now almost complete, at least in outline. A model-based description of spin, 
though, is not exactly a subject matter that has received much encourage­
ment in the physics curricula of the past sixty years. Ever since Dirac's 
introduction of spin as a by-product of a wave equation linearization, the 
spin concept has been regarded as an essentially abstract affair, not con­
ducive to model-based speculations. While there have been attempts at 
modelling, most of them have not been able to tie together the known 
properties of spin particles. The exploration of the mathematical ramifica­
tions of spin have been more successful in homing in on spin's fundamental 
nature as a thing related to orientability and enantiomorphism.
Mathematically, spin was found to relate to a covering group for the 
rotation and Lorentz groups, or any linear orientation preserving group, 
for that matter. In fact, prior to their use in physics, Cartan had introduced 
spinorial-type considerations for the discussion of group structure. When 
seen from that angle, spin is found to relate to the orientability of 
manifolds and the existence of orientable objects therein. Haefligerl has 
stated the necessary and sufficient conditions for a manifold to support a 
"spin structure" (see chapter XV; 5). From a physical point of view, spin 
structure now relates to enantiomorphic pairing in spacetime. In a spatial 
sense, an enantiomorphic pairing has been known for a long time in crys­
tallography. Physical spin adds a dynamic aspect to crystallography's static 

130
CHAPTER VIII
enantiomorphism. Note that the enantiomorphism of imbedded structures 
can have a global meaning if, and only if, the imbedding manifold is 
orientable. It means there is no circuitous path in spacetime that can carry 
one member of an enantiomorphic pair over into its companion. The 
individuality of such unordered pairs is therefore not negotiable.
This little detour in mathematics is necessary to appreciate the now 
following model-based discussion of electron spin as more than a possibly 
ad hoc procedure. Let us take chapter Vi's integral Eq. 15 as the period 
integral governing spin, thus accepting Kiehn's electromagnetic definition 
of the spin 3-form. There is a theorem by Kuenneth (chapter XIII; ref.l) 
that permits the decomposition of the period integral of this 3-form (the 
exterior product of the one-form A and the 2-form G ) into the product of 
two period integrals:
| S = | R^G = A | G = n(h/e)se = h ; for n = s = k = 1. 
7
C3 
Ci C2
Eq.7 gives an integrated spin of the electron equal to Planck's constant 
h. Standard quantum mechanical procedures, by contrast, must be 
understood as operating with the differential notion of orbital h/2rr (prior 
to a 2k loop integration) and a corresponding differential spin angular- 
momentum notion h/4ir (prior to a 4tt loop integration). The factors 2tc 
and 4k are traditionally related to a rotational-unit operation and a spin 
unit operation. The latter, sometimes visualized by the so-called "spinor­
spanner," can, for the present purpose, be more appropriately illustrated 
with the help of Fig.2.
How does a nontrivial unit operation 4k enter the integration process 
indicated in Eq.7? The answer is obviously not through the integral 
but through the integral |R , because ci is forced to remain in the field-free 
interior of the trefoil. Since Cj is forced to take a knotted path 4tc inside the 
field-free trefoil tube, the transition from integrated to differential spin is 
accordingly h/4Tr = ti/2, compare hereto Fig.2.
These arguments are not designed to please afficionados of abstract spin 
formalisms. They illustrate how a too-restricted mathematical approach 
generates mysterious nonclassical complexity later. "Nonclassical" is such 
an easy word to say. The irony is, if current mathematical tools of 
physics were already ill-equipped for dealing with the perfectly classical 
matters of crystal symmetry and crystal physics, why should we expect 
them to do better for particle enantiomorphism? The result was that 
physics could not avoid falling victim to the perfectly irrelevant 
nonclassical obscurism of standard spin theory. Orientation changing 
operations have been absent in physics, except as ad hoc reminders.

ENANTIOMORPHIC PAIR OF TREFOIL KNOTS
Figure 2: Here depicted are two enantiomorphic modifications of the 
spatial trefoil knot. They can neither be identified by motions nor by 
deformations in three-dimensional space. The two modifications of this knot 
are a nontrivial topological mirror pair in an orientable space. The cha­
racterization nontrivial refers here to the exclusive role of identification 
by improper (Ze. mirror-type) transformation. "Topological" refers to the 
invariance of the pair property, even under continuous deformations.
The obtruseness of PCT physics bears ample witness to this fact. The 
SO-3 bound spinor calculus of physics could be said to be an ad hoc local 
substitute for properly dealing with the global character of orientability. 
Ironically, it is all an aftermath of the undue SO-3 restriction precipitated 
by the vehicle of standard vector analysis!
3. Josephson and Quantum Hall Effects
In the process of having to make convoluted conceptual detours, one 
would almost forget what this discussion of electron structure is all about. 
The objective was to show that it is relevant to speak of field-free interiors 
for electrons and other particles. A particle with a field-free interior 
permits period integral applications of chapter Vi's Eqs.12 and 13 in envi­
ronments that are not field-free, because now the orbit itself traces a 
permissible integration path. Once this fact is established, a wealth of appli­
cations opens up pertaining to situations that are not otherwise transparent. 
Here is a selection.

132
CHAPTER VHI
The Josephson ac effect connects a voltage step V at a superconducting 
Josephson junction with the observation of a junction-related frequency v. 
The discussions in chapters VI and VII, pertaining to factors 2 of Cooper 
pairing and cyclotron versus Larmor frequencies, can now help in guiding 
the way to this integral taken over the period T = 1/i> :
fTVdt = n h/2e . 
8
oJ
For n=l Eq.8 gives h/e in terms of the voltage-frequency ratio
h/e = 2V/v . 
9
Eq.9 gives very reproducible measurements of the h/e ratio.
Now, consider the flux quantization in a superconducting ring. The 
tubular ring, in principle, provides a field-free interior inside the ring tube 
for the integration cycle q. Electron pairing is essential in order to move 
in one another's magnetic field. Yet pairing indicates the possibility of 
many electron pairs in the same quantum state. Eq. 12 of chapter VI gives 
directly the observed result. Superconducting rings cut in halves and sand­
wiched together with Josephson junctions can be made to give interesting 
demonstrations of the Aharonov-Bohm effect when they link an adjustable 
external magnetic field. Except for the pairing argument, the two examples 
given so far can, and have been, treated by the wave-function uniqueness 
approach, which as mentioned earlier, is very close to a period integral 
argument.
A different situation prevails in the case of the quantum Hall effect ob­
served in the two-dimensional interface of MOSFETs (metal oxide semi­
conductor field-effect transistor). This situation requires a simultaneous 
application of two period integrals (chapter Vi's Eq. 13 and Eq. 14). At low 
temperatures, this device has been found to manifest plateaus of constant 
Hall impedance at which, for all practical purposes, the forward resistance 
goes to zero. In the plateau states, the two-dimensional charge carriers as­
sume a macroscopic state of cooperative order, which can be visualized as a 
translating lattice of cyclotron states with the common cyclotron period T. 
The Hall impedance Zh is determined by the ratio of the Hall voltage Vh
and the forward current Jp. This ratio can be converted into a ratio of pe­
riod integrals by multiplying numerator and denominator by T:

The first observations of this effect were taken to correspond to ground 

FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS
133
states of flux n=l. The number s has been called the Landau filling factor 
of the cyclotron states, because Landau first gave a Schroedinger descrip­
tion of quantized cyclotron states. Since there is here an accumulation of 
electrons in the same quantum states, there should also exist some mecha­
nism of pair forming to provide the necessary boson characteristics to do 
so. This pairing implies even s values.
Shortly after the first observations, new data became available indicat­
ing that, contingent upon the initial ground state premise n=l, the filling 
factor s could also assume the value of rational fractions. At that point, all 
bets on a simple theory in terms of standard quantum methods were off. 
Subsequent attempts at explaining these phenomena have called on ground 
state solutions of the many particle Schroedinger equation. The picture 
that thus transpires is one of an apparent fractional charge.2 This state of 
affairs has also been visualized as a cyclotron lattice with a sublattice of 
partially empty orbits.
The complexity of the Schroedinger approach was further compounded 
by experimental observations that the fractional s seemed to have only 
"odd" denominators. A little later, "even" denominator fractions s were 
observed and somehow, also, they were accounted for by Schroedinger- 
based arguments.
Looking at this brief overview of traditional approaches to the quantum 
Hall effects, one can hardly help being tempted by the simplicity of the pe­
riod integral procedure summarized in the transition of equations, as illus­
trated by Eq. 10. A word is in order to show Eq. 10 to be more than just a 
coincidental transcription towards a known end result. A more leisurely 
discussion, justifying in large part the viability of this transition by semi- 
classical arguments, can be found in section 2 of chapter IX. Comparison 
shows as a major predicament encountered in the Schroedinger-based 
approach, that it is not so much the Schroedinger method itself that is to 
blame, but rather the tacit insistence on ground state conditions.
The origin of the ground state premise goes back to the early under­
standing of superfluidity, because the loss mechanisms come to a halt for 
anything residing in its lowest quantum state. Yet a comparison with the 
quantized flux states in a superconducting ring shows the existence of a se­
ries of quantized flux states well above the ground state. The question is 
whether these higher flux states are generated by more participating elec­
tron pairs, all circulating in a kinematic ground state of motion, or can the 
participating electron pairs be jointly elevated into a higher kinematic 
state? The cited difficulties would be closer to a resolution if the quantum 
numbers n and s were independently observable. The Schroedinger 
equation, all by itself, cannot give an unambiguous answer, because the 
fermion-boson choice needs to be injected as an alien additional element.

134
CHAPTER VIII
The ensuing many particle Schroedinger equation has retained a much 
more academic status than the single-particle Schroedinger equation.
The procedure illustrated in Eq. 10 calls on two period integrals. The 
period integral of Aharonov-Bohm conveys the Schroedinger phase infor­
mation; the integral of Ampere-Gauss conveys information about a coop­
erative motion of the charge carriers. The ability of the Schroedinger pro­
cess to cover cooperative behavior needs to be questioned.
Any adaptation of the Schroedinger process to accommodate wider 
ranges of applications would most likely have to depend upon the injection 
of extraneous criteria fitting the situation at hand. However, that also 
requires a reassessment of quantum mechanics' statistical implications. The 
preceding considerations reveal a measure of complementarity between 
Schroedinger process and period integrals. The crucial distinction: period 
integrals are not statistical; however, the Schroedinger process is!
The conflict situation here alluded to was resolved in the past by point­
ing at mathematical asymptotics between Schroedinger and Bohr-Sommer- 
feld. The latter were regarded as a geometric-optic approximation of the 
Schroedinger result, thus placing the Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals in the cat­
egory of an inexact procedure in physics. Leaving this statement for what it 
is, at least for the time being, a question arises whether or not the period 
integrals Eqs. 12-15 of chapter VI are also to be regarded as approximate 
tools of physics. After all, in witness of chapter Vi's Eq.7, the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld process can be looked at as derivable from Aharonov-Bohm.
Since it is hard to maintain that the Ampere-Gauss integral (Eq. 14, 
chapter VI) would be of an approximate nature, it is for exactly the same 
reasons hard to maintain that the Aharonov-Bohm and Kiehn integrals 
(Eqs.12,13 and 15, chapter VI) are to be regarded as having an ap­
proximate status in physics. While there is no question that results obtained 
with Bohr-Sommerfeld relate asymptotically to results obtained with the 
Schroedinger equation, this fact alone does not justify a relegation of Bohr- 
Sommerfeld to the realm of inexact physical tools. There is an option, not 
considered in the past: i.e., to replace the mathematical asymptotics by a 
physical asymptotics. In other words: Bo hr-Sommerfeld and Schroedinger 
address dijferent physical situations. Hence, more cautiously, the two 
physical situations, instead, are asymptotically related.
It cannot be denied that the here-presented option of giving the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld conditions the benefit of the doubt is really what should have 
happened to begin with. There is no logical ground for ruling one method 
as approximate, unless all avenues have been explored, making sure they 
address exactly the same physical situation. Since that has not been done in 
the past, this premature conclusion now stands corrected.
Yet, even if theory has no obvious last word in these matters, the practi­
cal results of Josephson effect (h/e) and quantum Hall effect (h/e2) have

been dramatic for metrology. These two experiments now provide mea­
surements reproducible to within seven decimal places for the quanta of 
action h and charge e. Table I shows measurements based on a mixed 
data input from quantum electrodynamics and other sources. Fluctuations 
affecting the fourth decimal places for e and h are apparent. If this con­
tradicts reports that quantum electrodynamics has been credited 
with predictions covering ten decimal places, an explanation lies 
in a mix-up of absolute and relative precisions. The numbers are 
displayed in Table I. They speak their own irrefutable language.

cited for the year 1963.
The just-presented experiences provide some material that might be in­
terpreted as inviting a reassessment of some standard notions of quantum 
theory. Further pursuit of these matters should not avoid the mentioning of 
some recent experimentation that has given evidence of single-particle 
diffraction. Since diffraction has been so exclusively identified with wave 
motion, the manifestation of such a phenomenon almost sounds like a con­
tradiction in terms.
The descriptions of this unexpected particle performance still tend to 
seek predominantly a basis in the Schroedinger method. A procedure, ini­
tiated much earlier by Bohm and Vigier,3 reveals a trajectory feature of 
the Schroedinger solutions. This method has proven effective in predicting 
the trajectories of diffracting single particles. The old alternative of wave 
or particle now called for a wave and particle proposition. The old 
Copenhagen dichotomy of indecision between ensemble and single particle 
had once again reared its ugly head.

136
CHAPTER VIII
It is of relevance to mention briefly that Fenyes^ and others have used a 
Bohm-Vigier-type argument to "derive" the Schroedinger equation from 
the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. This step can only be accomplished 
by injecting a so-called quantum potential in the Lagrangian. The Bohm- 
Vigier reverse process of identifying this quantum potential by means of 
the Schroedinger equation is less pretentious.
Modem methods of coincidence counting have made the single particle 
experiments very convincing. However, hard X-ray photons had already, 
much earlier exhibited a semblance of one particle diffraction. They have 
been the subject of investigations by Duane^ in the early Twenties, prior to 
the discovery of the Schroedinger equation. The tools available to Duane 
were the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. Using photon momentum and the 
periodicity of the diffracting crystal lattice, Duane showed how the Bragg 
formula of wave diffraction if obtained, provided photon momentum p and 
wave vector k obey the relation (chapter III; 3):
p= (h/2jr)k . 
11
Note how Eq. 11 harbors the hidden ingredients of Copenhagen's later 
point-particle thesis, because it relates a domain-based momentum p to a 
point-based field quantity k. Yet, notwithstanding this mathematically for­
bidden identification of "apples and oranges," the physical compromise it 
entails has been most rewarding, although not without limitations. For 
comparison, the reader should also note that the Bohr-Sommerfeld integral 
and the period integrals Eqs. 12-15 of chapter VI don't invoke a similar 
mathematical incompatibility, because e, h/e, and h have a well- 
recognized domain status.
Using relativity-based arguments, Eq. 11 was simultaneously obtained by 
de Broglie. He instead assigned waves to material particles. Duane's objec­
tive clearly was directed towards associating a particle identity with the 
photon impact that is so prevalently observed in Geiger-Mueller counters 
used for the detection of hard X-rays. Yet, ironically, it was de Broglie's 
inverse procedure that led to the discovery of Schroedinger's equation.
An alternative to squeezing Eq. 11 into the straitjacket of a wave de­
scription is the option of looking at {co,k} directly as particle attributes. 
This option has remained underdeveloped in contemporary physics, be­
cause it invokes a need for particle modelling. Models have remained 
submerged in the Copenhagen sea of universal uncertainty.
This juxtaposition of the Bohm-Vigier wave trajectory analysis of the 
Schroedinger equation and Duane's application of Bohr-Sommerfeld meth­
ods underlines, in an entirely different setting, the complementary func­
tional positions of Schroedinger equation and period integration. Here, 
once more, is reason to abandon the old prejudice of relegating period inte­
gration to a position inferior to solving the Schroedinger equation. The 

FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS 
137
truth is they have a domain of overlap, the details of which should be the 
subject of further investigation. It is probably the best way of learning to 
understand the limitations of the Schroedinger process.
4. Preliminary Overview of Results
The objective of this whole endeavor has been merely an attempt at 
constructing a more coherently organized picture of some physical laws 
that have been around for some time. Yet, in presentations and subsequent 
discussions of period integral techniques, one finds an uneasiness of attitude 
which seems to act as a hurdle on a possible path to greater acceptance. 
This uneasiness tends to translate into a nonverbal state of suspicion. In the 
light of such incomplete communication, let us call on the old devil’s advo­
cate by bringing hidden suspicions to greater awareness. Here are the re­
sults of piecing together sundry remarks generated by this subject matter.
First of all, there is the suspicion of the approximate and asymptotic 
nature of the period integrals. This topic has been extensively treated in the 
preceding sections. So, at this point, we shall assume that the reader is now 
willing to accept the preliminary conclusion that period integrals and 
Schroedinger equation address different physical realities, which are suffi­
ciently close to account for a certain overlap in results.
The next item on the agenda is concerned with the question of when and 
how to apply the Eqs.12-15 of chapter VI. Approaching quantum mechani­
cal situations with the Schroedinger equation, one is prepared for some 
hard work of solving eigenvalue problems. As mentioned earlier, the pe­
riod integrals Eqs. 12-15 of chapter VI are ready and solved. The where 
and when of their application, though, should ultimately become a matter 
of judicious physical decision-making. Yet, in the process of finding a way 
between Schroedinger equation and period integrals, there is no harm in 
trying things out to see what works best. Rather than dogmatically insist­
ing on the one-and-only way, there should be room for some theoretical 
adventure. It is just another way, other than by physical experiment, of 
asking nature questions by doing "theory experiments" instead.
There is also a psychological hurdle to overcome, because we have all 
been conditioned to believe that good results can only be obtained after 
much hard work. The period integral method seems too easy and generates 
suspicion, which, in turn, brings about a frame of mind to reject the 
extremely simple transcriptions of Eqs.9 and 10.
Let us now examine more closely the judicious decision-making in­
volved in the where-and-when of applying period integrals. In many ways, 
the decision-making is purely a matter of finding a cogent physical 
rationale as to when to use the Schroedinger equation and when to use 
period integrals. Here we enter potentially dangerous territory. The 
essence can be summarized in a more than sixty-year-old question: Where 

138
CHAPTER VID
does the Schroedinger equation come from and what are its limits of 
applicability? Alternatively, one may ask: what is the nature of the wave­
function's statistics? Answers for a judicious choice between period 
integrals and wave equation can hardly be forthcoming unless we 
understand more precisely each of the protagonists. What better way of 
getting to know them than by having them compete for relevant results.
A great help in the now-following endeavor is the scholarly book by 
Jammer^ on the history and philosophy of quantum mechanics. Most texts 
on quantum mechanics exhibit bias versus what presently may be known as 
the Copenhagen interpretation. Yet, more so than any text I have seen so 
far, Jammer's book makes it clear how essentially two major interpreta- 
tional options are compatible with the standard quantum formalism. We 
can now build on conclusions summarized in chapter VI; 8.
The probability amplitude defined by the Schroedinger wave function 
describes either (1) the statistics of a Gibbsian-type ensemble of conceiv­
able manifestation of a single-quantum mechanical system, or (2) the statis­
tics of a true ensemble of an actual plurality of systems that are identical 
and prepared in a similar quantum state.
An interpretation (1), or variations thereof, are usually referred to as a 
Copenhagen interpretation. Interpretation (2) has been known as a statisti­
cal or ensemble interpretation, though neither name very clearly delin­
eates the plurality of actual physical systems involved. After all, the 
Copenhagen interpretation also deals with an ensemble, an abstract Gibbs- 
type ensemble is here associated with the statistics.
A major distinction between the two interpretations manifests itself in a 
concept that has become known as quantum mechanical uncertainty. The 
original Gibbsian concept of conceivable manifestations of one and the 
same system now undergoes an extrapolated specialization, in the sense that 
no single system can ever be expected to be in a state of absolute rest. This 
premise does not sit too well with the premises of relativity, because it 
creates a hidden premise of an absolute reference with respect to which this 
state of unrest is to be established. Since a state of unrest is kinetic in na­
ture, the uncertainty dogma comes full circle by a synonymity with the 
concept of single-system zero-point energy.
Interpretation (2), by contrast, deals with finite ensembles of real physi­
cal systems. Its associated statistics relates to a mutual behavior of member 
systems in the ensemble, and thus avoids the relativity predicament. Since 
this statistics has no thermal connotation, the question is now: what mutual 
system parameters are eligible for that purpose? Here it is appropriate to 
call on Planck,6 who first introduced the concept of zero-point energy as a 
typical manifestation of a real physical ensemble (chapter HI; 5).

FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS
139
The parameter subject to statistical randomization is the mutual phase of 
the constituent systems of the ensemble. Additional evidence is available in 
a calculation that has surfaced in the Russian literature.^ It shows how a 
randomly oriented ensemble of systems, all of which reside in the indi­
vidual state n, will assume an ensemble average of A/n(n+l). Also the 
details of the statistical randomization orientation are more extensively 
discussed in chapter III;5.
Since solving the Schroedinger equation gives "full-automatically" the 
ensemble flavored features of Planck's zero-point energy and the quantum 
average ^n(n+l), the question is justified whether the Schroedinger 
equation can truly be expected to describe a single quantum mechanical 
system, instead, of a statistically randomized ensemble of such systems.
Similar questions now need to be asked about the nature of quantum 
mechanical uncertainty and zero-point energy. Yet, even these two cases 
have not sufficed to establish without ambiguity the physical ensemble 
nature of Schroedinger's method. Textbooks have even presented these 
derivations as conceivable support for the Copenhagen Gibbsian-type 
ensemble. Let us therefore examine some recent observational evidence 
that can be related to the here given arguments.
The so-called optically "squeezed states" (chapter III; 4) have given 
experimental proof that systems can drop below the Heisenberg uncertainty 
level, provided a companion system correspondingly ends up above the 
Heisenberg level.8 Here Heisenberg uncertainty is only obeyed as a system 
average. The system plurality implied by these observations suggests a 
quantum mechanical interpretation in category (2): i.e., of ensembles con­
sisting of real physical systems. Neither logically nor observationally is it 
indicated to accommodate these phenomena with the help of the 
Copenhagen single-system interpretation (1) or variations thereof.
Once the Schroedinger equation is accepted as a tool applicable to true 
ensembles randomized in phase and orientation, then the period integrals 
can be accepted as single-system tools. The physical difference of the re­
spective fields of applicability of Schroedinger equation and period inte­
grals has now been delineated. Asymptotic behavior between an isolated 
system and an ensemble of those systems is to be expected. Yet those dif­
ferences now are no longer a valid cause for questioning the precise valid­
ity of the period integrals versus the Schroedinger equation. Each has its 
own domain, with a measure of overlap.
The next upcoming question is what we ought to do about ensembles 
that are no longer randomized in phase and orientation? Many of the 
macroscopic quantum effects are in this category. The cooperative order 
in such ensembles makes the whole ensemble behave as if it were a single 
system. The easier assessment of these ordered systems in terms of period 

140
CHAPTER VIII
integrals, as compared to the Schroedinger method, is living testimony 
supportive of the given delineation of a two-tier approach.
Yet, the evidence supportive of interpretation (2) has been known for 
the most part and still has not been able to swing physics' publicly stated 
opinion away from the Copenhagen interpretation. Some of the 
fundamental causes of this inertia have to do with the relation between the 
Copenhagen interpretation and quantum electrodynamics. A transition 
from interpretation (1) to (2) would undermine quantum electrodynamics' 
(QED) use of the zero-point energy of vacuum. Supporters of 
interpretation (2) have remained tongue-in-cheek about this important 
aspect. There is an understandable reluctance to abandon the amazing 
calculational potential of QED for matters of merely philosophical and 
conceptual virtue. The main reason why the issue may now be resubmitted 
for further scrutiny is the period integral calculation of at least one of the 
major results of QED (i.e., the electron's anomalous magnetic moment as 
presented in the previous section). This microphysical result, which is 
contingent on the electron’s field-free interior, extends the applicability of 
the Aharonov-Bohm law to many practical cases of macroscopic and 
microscopic quantum effects.
While not much more than a sketch, the given calculation of the elec­
tron's magnetic moment and spin does not invoke the infinities of QED. 
The latter (QED) is contingent on the extension of the concept of zero­
point energy to the somewhat hypothetical family of harmonic oscillators 
of the electromagnetic field in vacuum. Standing waves of this type have 
been used to calculate (the experimentally verified) Casimir effect of at­
traction between two plates. Conventional quantum mechanical methods 
though have been shown to yield the same result.^ All of which goes to 
show that the zero-point energies of vacuum, whether real or not, are not 
to be underestimated as calculational expedients. It is one of those frustrat­
ing enigmas of physical theory, if what we believe to be the more logical 
and consistent method has trouble competing with methods that don't mea­
sure up to that test.
It would be unfair to dwell merely on the problems of the Schroedinger 
method, without giving the period integrals more of a preliminary 
probing. Since the three integrals, as here used, are interdependent, one 
wonders whether Eqs. 14 and 15 of chapter VI should be taken as primary 
choices. The decision between chapter Vi's Eqs.12 and 13, when seen as a 
ratio of its Eq.l5/Eq.l4, then can be made to depend on what Eq.14 counts. 
This is, at least, a half-way justification for Onsager's electron-pairing 
argument. The pairing, which was used by Onsager as an explanation of the 
unexpected factor 2 in chapter Vi's Eq. 12, is discussed in chapter VII.
Anyone claiming that the Schroedinger equation describes phase and di­
rection randomized ensembles, instead, of nondescript nonclassical single 

FITTING PERIOD INTEGRALS TO PHYSICS
141
system situations can expect major opposition. For one, it is bound to re­
new the pressure for deriving Schroedinger's gift from heaven from first 
principles, say from the period integrals, if the latter truly have first prin­
ciple status. It is the traditional punishment handed out to those who claim 
the existence of a true ensemble basis of quantum mechanics. So far, the 
period integrals, here considered, relate solely to stationary states. The 
Schroedinger equation, by contrast, describes stationary as well as 
transition states. Additional period integral information about quantum 
transitions is needed (Chapter XIII). Here we refrain from finding a 
complete "derivation" for an equation that is seen as a gift from heaven. 
Respect for giver and gift demands that we first probe the realm where the 
gift may be used without abusing its potentialities.
Bohm and Vigier^ have shown that a "derivation" of the Schroedinger 
equation from the equations of continuum mechanics is contingent on the 
injection of a Bohm-Vigier-type quantum potential. In the Fifties and Six­
ties there were a number of papers on this theme by Nelson,3 Fenyes^ and 
Weizel.3 The latter, in particular, suggests a zero-point connotation for 
the quantum potential.
A major reason why truly convincing derivations have not been forth­
coming points at deeper distinctions between period- and Schroedinger 
methods. The latter is capable of dealing with so-called transitional states, 
whereas the period method seems so far restricted to the description of sta­
tionary states of excitations only. It is well known that not all transitions 
between those stationary states of excitation are equally probable. The great 
improvement of the Schroedinger method over the Bohr-Sommerfeld 
method was its ability of reliably predicting transitional selection rules.
In the light of this typical distinction, one is inclined to infer that the se­
lection rules are at least, in part, a consequence of the "ensemble 
awareness" of the individual systems. Yet, one can hardly expect 
conclusions about ensemble behavior without at least an insight in the 
primary disposition of the isolated system to respond to the ensemble. 
What is the criterion for a change of state of the isolated single system?
An emission or absorption event is a transitional state of a finite size 
system over a finite interval of time. Such an event should be recordable 
in terms of a spacetime integral extended over the spatial extent of the sys­
tem and over the interval of time during which the event takes place. This 
finite event domain D4 of M4 may be expected to be simply connected. Its 
boundary c3 = 3D4 should then be the topological equivalent of a 3-sphere. 
It is now tempting to equate an emission or absorption event with 
"something" that comes out or goes into D4. Since the events are known to 
be quantized, the question now is what 3-form has quantized period 
residues that could account for such events?

142
CHAPTER VIII
The 3-form of field R^G conceivably could be regarded as a possible 
candidate. Yet the earlier applications made of this 3-form reveal it as a 
tool depicting stationary states, not transitional states. Note that the station­
ary state option corresponds to a decomposition of its integral into a prod­
uct of 1- and 2-dimensional period integrals of a more familiar vintage.
R.M. Kiehn (chapter XIII, ref.2) considers the 3-form R^F, which is 
the exterior product of a closed 1-form R and an exact 2-form F = dR. Any 
decomposable situation, comparable to R^G, should now give identically 
zero, because F has no nonzero residues. Yet R^F can have nonzero 
residues for a cycle c3 topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere. This leads to 
a spacetime integral over an interior where F^F -» E-B *0. This inequality 
is known as a criterion of nonintegrability of A, leading to a doubly bladed 
bivector F. Hence, events of emission and absorption are interestingly con­
current with a temporary state of nonintegrability of A. The residues of 
f R^F are found to be multiples of (h/e)2.
In order not to overload an investigation of period integrals too early 
with too many ramifications, let it suffice, for the present, that at least two 
crucial Schroedinger results^ can be verified by a statistical processing of 
period integral results.
What is the upshot of this plea for reinstating period integrals as a more 
nearly exact tool of physics? It opens up new avenues for particle modeling 
and possibilities for macroscopic quantum systems. Zero-point energy, un­
certainty, and Schroedinger equation now reflect a pre-thermal statistics of 
mutual-system phase and orientation in an ensemble.
Specifically, it can be said: period integrals are the exploratory tools for 
establishing the nature and shape of physical objects, regardless of whether 
these objects are large or small. For the specification of integration do­
mains of period integrals, electric charge is to be seen as a primary 
"substance" of physics. It determines topology by separating distinct field 
domains. Faraday cage and Meissner effect in superconductors provide 
macroscopic prototypes of such separation. The absence of metric parame­
ters in these descriptional tools permits the extrapolation of such properties 
into the micro-domain, including elementary charge itself.
The integration loop of the one-dimensional period integral is like a 
thread strung through the field-free holes of the physical object under con­
sideration. The loop can be shrunk onto the object until the latter's 
"substance" acts as an obstruction preventing further shrinking. The cycle 
of a two-dimensional period integral is like a plastic sheath wrapped 
around and shrunk onto the object, until its substance acts as an obstruction 
preventing further shrinking. Three-dimensional period integrals are, or

143
can be, cyclic product combinations of what might be called string and 
plastic wrap. Taking the Pfaffian integral P= |A~dA as a stability crite­
rion, one finds P=0 for stable particles drawing worldlines in spacetime. 
These worldlines originate and terminate in simply connected event do­
mains where P#0. This picture provides, for all practical purposes, the ba­
sis for a Feynman diagram. In chapter XII and XIII, the potential of these 
methods are investigated in much more extensive detail.
In addition the reader should also be made aware of existing variations 
on the theme of model-based calculations of the electron's anomalous 
moment. Recent discussions have been given by BarutlO and ElbazJ 1

CHAPTER IX
IMPLICATIONS OF COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR
1. Cooperative Order and Zero-Point Motion
A reexamination of experimental findings about flux quantization 
places in question the effective applicability of the Schroedinger process to 
cooperative phenomena. The apparent suspension of wave-equation 
procedures assumes dramatic proportions for the quantum Hall effects.
Few equations in physics have a wider and more versatile applicability 
than the Schroedinger equation. In fact its success as a major tool of 
modem physics has been so great that, in the course of time, physicists 
have developed a nearly religious conviction about its almost unlimited 
potential. Short of the realms of QED, QCD, and Dirac's relativistic 
spinor equation, the relevance of the Schroedinger equation has virtually 
remained unquestioned except by Schroedinger himself and a few others.
The situation conveys the ironic picture of a younger generation be­
lieving that Schroedinger himself perhaps did not fully understand the 
extraordinary potential of his own equation. It is not unusual in music that 
young performers frequently know better what to do with a composition 
than the composer himself. The analogue of a difference between creating 
and recreating performers may be said to manifest itself also in the realm 
of the physical and engineering sciences.
Yet, unlike the musical composition, which is regarded as having 
reached a final form once it is published, efforts to improve and extend the 
machinery of quantum mechanics remain an ongoing endeavor. Few 
theories can be said to have reached a form that does not invite further 
tinkering. While the Dirac equation is to be regarded as a further develop­
ment of the Schroedinger equation, attempts at extending the Dirac scheme 
into a workable method for dealing with many particles with spin ran into 
difficulties in retaining full relativistic invariance. Yet none of these 
hurdles has been big enough to shake the convictions of those who believed 
in the Schroedinger single-sytem supremacy.
Mindful that religious denominations are known to take directions for 
which the founders cannot be held responsible, the conclusion following 
from this comparison indicates that a fair measure of religious argument 
has also assumed a place in physics. Any awareness of a law of nature starts 
out with a hunch or a belief that something might be true. The difference
144

IMPLICATIONS OF COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR
145
between science and religion is that science demands a substantiation of the 
stated beliefs. In religion, such substantiation may be beyond what is 
deemed to be possible.
In quantum mechanics, physics somehow is involved in situations half­
way between science and religion. The many useful applications of the 
Schroedinger equation indicate that the belief works. In fact, it works so 
often and so well that the sheer statistical evidence of applicability is taken 
as proof and substantiation of the stated beliefs. Whenever we run into an 
exception we are inclined to suspect first an error in the implementation of 
our beliefs and not the belief itself. We have not yet reached the courage 
of our convictions to test our quantum mechanical beliefs beyond the point 
where we keep overwhelming ourselves with the brute force of statistics.
In the following, two examples will be examined which give direct and 
near-incontrovertible evidence of the inapplicability of the Schroedinger 
equation to highly ordered systems. The experimental evidence for one of 
these examples has, quite surprisingly, been around for almost three 
decades. The argument goes back to the discovery of flux quantization and 
it is based on the experimentally confirmed absence of a residual zero-point 
flux in superconducting rings.
The second example is of more recent vintage and relates to the 
quantum Hall effect. The latter is pictured as a lattice of identical 
cyclotron states drifting past the voltage probe of a Hall sample. The 
cyclotron state and the superconducting ring state have in common that 
electrons circulate in a magnetic field. For the ring, the magnetic B field is 
generated by the electrons themselves circulating at the rate co of the 
Larmor frequency, where co = ( e/2 m)B. For the cyclotron, they are 
circulating in an external B field, at the cyclotron rate co = (e/m)B.
A Schroedinger analysis of the quantum states of electrons circulating in 
magnetic fields has been given by Landau. 1 The result of his calculations 
is given by the following energy expression:
En = (n + 1/2)bco ± £pB; n = 0,1,2,3,  
1
with £=1 for external B and £=1/2 for internal self-B. The magnetic 
moment p of the electron is
pi = (e/m)(ti/2)(1 + Of/2tT), 
2
including the first order anomaly term (a/Zrr 1=0.00116... .
It is now easily verified that the individual spin terms in Eq.l have the 
values ±(‘hco/2)(1 + ar/2'n’), provided £=1 combines with the cyclotron 
frequency and £=1/2 is combined with the Larmor frequency. Except for 
the small anomaly term or/27T, the zero-point contribution tico/2 in the 
first right hand term of Eq.l would be almost completely masked by a spin 
contribution of the second term.

146
CHAPTER IX
For a superconducting situation, such as prevails in the rings used for 
the determination of flux quantization, the BCS anti-parallel pairing of 
electrons may be expected to lead to a cancellation of the spin contri­
butions, including the anomaly term. It then follows from the Landau 
energy spectrum given by Eq.l that an observable zero-point contribution 
is retained, because it is not now masked by spin terms.
Given the situation at hand, it is hard to understand how else the zero­
point motion could manifest itself than by a residual circulatory motion of 
electrons; it is, after all, the degree of kinematic freedom considered in the 
Landau analysis. Such a residual circulatory motion at half the quantum 
level, even if hard to understand from a point of view of dynamics, would 
unavoidably lead to an associated residual half-flux quant h/4e.
A careful examination of the thirty-year-old experimental flux data of 
Deaver-Fairbank^ and Doll-Naebauer^ does not show any evidence 
supporting the thesis of a residual zero-point flux. Compare hereto chapter 
III; 6; Fig.2. There is little question that we are here confronted with a 
conflict situation between theory and observation with the inescapable 
conclusion that theory would have to yield to the reality of observation. 
Here is "almost" incontrovertible evidence raising the question: how far 
should one go in always giving Copenhagen the benefit of the doubt? Yet, 
mindful of man's propensity for finding arguments to rescue prevailing 
teachings, let us examine another angle.
In the just-given discussion the Landau analysis has been adapted to a 
situation with an internally generated B field by inserting the factor 1/2 in 
front of the spin terms of Eq.l; which is typical of the difference between a 
self-energy term versus a mutual energy term. This step is here intended 
to leave the Schroedinger analysis in the capable hands of Landau.
The following rationale is one way of justifying this extrapolation of 
Landau results. In the self-field situation, one half of the electrons can be 
considered as performing a cyclotron motion in the field generated by the 
other half. This picture is compatible with the Larmor frequency being 
half the cyclotron frequency. The half in front of the spin term then sim­
ply becomes a factor accounting for the active B field. It is incumbent 
upon those who see this argument as inadequate to give an independent 
Schroedinger analysis for the harmonic electron motion in the supercon­
ducting ring, by showing explicitly how the zero-point term vanishes.
At this point, we note how the theoretical expectation of a zero-point 
energy appear at variance with the experimental observations cited in 
refs.2 and 3. This state of affairs, in turn, places in question the 
applicability of the Schroedinger process to physical situations that are 
distinguished by a high degree of cooperative behavior.

2. The Quantum Hall Effect
The quantum Hall effect is experimentally rather unique in that it 
permits a direct observation of quantum states. These days, measurement 
theory refers to such situations as a "nondemolition" measurement. The 
Hall probe examines a transport of a lattice of identical cyclotron states. 
The measurement does not require a changing of quantum states. Only at 
the beginning and the end of the Hall sample exists a balanced creation and 
annihilation of cyclotron states. Table I of the previous chapter has already 
illustrated the reproducibility of data obtained by experiments based on the 
direct observation of quantum states. In chapter VIII, a striking relation­
ship between quantum Hall effect and period integration has demonstrated 
the potential superiority of the global method for treating such macro­
scopic quantum phenomena.
Examples of attempted theoretical analyses in terms of the Schroedinger 
equation can be found in a recent monograph.^ The cited method of anal­
ysis centers around ground-state solutions of multiple particle Schroedinger 
equations. The number of particles considered (e.g., 2,4 or 6 particles) for 
a Landau state does not account for the whole MOSFET sample.
The cited approach mostly starts from ground-state Schroedinger solu­
tions. They may be said to correspond to cyclotron orbits intercepting only 
a single flux unit h/e of the applied B field. This restriction is not really 
called for by the physical situation. In fact, it is this silent assumption that 
has led to a dichotomy between what are believed to be two effects: the so- 
called integer and fractional effects. To rectify the consequences of this 
physically unnecessary imposition, an agreement with experimental reality 
then forces the introduction of either partially filled lattices of cyclotron 
states or some kind of hypothetical fractional charge.
These comparisons suggest that a Schroedinger approach seems anath­
ema in cooperative situations. This raises questions as to what kind of 
quantum tools can be used instead of the Schroedinger equation.
Acting on the need for describing a phenomenon manifesting a high 
degree of order with the exclusion of any identifiable statistical behavior, it 
is only logical and natural to ban for its description all tools that have 
statistical implications. The Schroedinger equation is therefore ruled out as 
a suitable tool. The following arguments, based on a straightforward model 
reflecting the cited order, then leads, in conjunction with the period 
integral quantization recipes of chapter VI, to a dramatically simplified 
description of the quantum Hall effects, in fact, no less than a unification of 
integer and fractional effects.
Consider the two-dimensional interaction space of a Hall effect sample 
of length L and width w. This interaction space is assumed to be filled with 

148
CHAPTER IX
a lattice of orbiting electrons in the same cyclotron quantum state. The 
surface density of cyclotron states be denoted by the symbol <r.
Each cyclotron orbit is assumed to have s orbiting electrons, thus giving 
a total charge per orbit of
q = s e, 
3
where e is the elementary charge of the electron and s is called the orbital 
filling factor.
Each orbit intercepts a flux F of the applied field of magnetic induction 
perpendicular to the surface of interaction. The orbitally linked flux <I> is 
taken to consist of n elementary flux units O0, where n is called the flux 
quantum number:
<b = n d>0 . 
4
The total orbitally intercepted flux F through the sample is now
F = a w L n <I>0 , 
5
and the total orbital charge in the sample is
Q = <r w I s e . 
6
The Hall impedance Zq is defined as the ratio of the Hall voltage Vh and 
the forward current Jf in the sample
Zh= Vn/Jf. 
7
The Hall voltage and forward current are presumed to come about as a 
result of a rigid motion of the whole lattice of cyclotron states. Let 
v = dl/dt be the lattice drift velocity in the lengthwise direction of the 
sample; one then obtains Vh from Eq.5 through Faraday's law of induction 
by taking dF/dt and Jf follows from its definition equation dQ/dt. Hence
Vh = cr uu n d>0 v , 
8
Jf = a ui s e v. 
9
From Eqs.7,8 and 9 one finds for the Hall impedance;
ZH = (n/s)(O0/e). 
10
The Eq.8 is an unusual yet rigorous application of the Faraday induction 
law. Only the orbitally linked flux travels past the Hall probe circuit. 
There is no criterion of travel for the flux outside the orbitally linked 
components.
The expression Eq. 10 is not only independent of the sample dimensions 
w and 1, it is also independent of the lattice drift velocity v. For given 
values of the quantum numbers n and s, the experiments show Eq. 10 to be 
met for an interval of applied field values B. For a MOSFET sample it is 
also possible to change the density of available electrons by changing the 
gate voltage. The corresponding changes in Jf for fixed n and s values 
point at an interval of permissible changes in lattice drift velocity v. These 
intervals of constant Zh are called "Hall effect plateaus."

IMPLICATIONS OF COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR
149
A comparison with experiment (or Eq. 13 of chapter VI) yields for <t>0 
the preferred value
<D0=h/e, 
11
(rather than h/2e) as the flux unit intercepted in an external B field. The 
h/2e value prevails for electrons circulating in a self-generated internal B 
field. By calling on the electron's field-free interior, it is possible to 
present more elaborate theoretical arguments supporting Eq.ll. However, 
rather than opening up a can of worms in a no man's land where 
Schroedinger's equation does not apply, an empirical acceptance of Eq.ll 
may, at this point, be preferred.
Since the Pauli principle (a Schroedinger independent premise) demands 
boson formation to have electrons accumulating in the same cyclotron 
quantum state, pair formation of electrons must be expected to be a fact of 
nature also in the case of the Hall effect. The extremely accurate rational 
number ratios n/s observed in experimentation present an emphatic plea 
favoring an electron pair formation resulting in a cancellation of the spin 
energy terms in Eq.l and their anomaly contributions.
It thus follows that the quantum number s can only assume even values. 
Since n can assume odd and even values, the experimentally observed 
simplified fractions corresponding to n/s are bound to lead to a cancellation 
of factors two due to an always present factor two in s.
The given description jointly accounts in a simple manner for most of 
the quantum Hall effect characteristics. It unifies integer and fractional 
effects. It shows the needed measure of sample independence. The forward 
current insensitivity, i.e., independence of the lattice drift velocity v, 
accounts for the plateau formation. An anti-parallel spin pairing is estab­
lished by the total absence of deviations due to the electron’s magnetic mo­
ment anomaly.
The even properties of the quantum number s finally can be called upon 
to account for an observed preference for "odd denominator" fractions for 
the fractional Hall effect. Please note that the literature gives preference to 
the inverse of the n/s factor. In the meantime, and as is to be expected from 
the here presented point of view, even valued denominators of s/n have 
now also been found.
An insight into why von Klitzing's procedure tends to favor integer s/n 
factors and why odd denominator s/n fractions dominate the scene in the 
observations of the fractional effect, can be obtained by making an s-»n 
diagram.
An inspection of diagram I clearly reveals the dominance of entrances 
with odd denominator such as observed by Tsui et al and Willet et al.S 
Since the observations by von Klitzing were performed by constant 
magnetic field, while varying the electron density, it is the parameter s that

150
CHAPTER IX
The given ordering of s/n data comes about by presupposing even s values 
combined with odd as well as even n values. Of the 50 entrances V = s/n shown in 
the diagram, 17 are integers. Of the remaining 33 reduced fractions, only 7 have even 
denominators. The observed dominance of odd denominator fractions is thus shown to 
be purely a consequence of an even s hypothesis, i.e., electron pairing.

changes. This explains why, for constant B (and n), a changing s has a 
greater probability of hitting the integer entrances on the left of the 
diagram. On the other hand changing B and correspondingly n, while 
keeping the electron density constant, will clearly lead to the fractional 
entrances on the right of diagram I.
Frantic experimental and theoretical activity is presently going on to 
better understand the nature of the two-dimensional lattice of Landau 
cyclotron states that is presumed to be responsible for Hall effect quantum 
behavior. The prevailing methods of analysis expect to be able to find a key 
to the manifest order displayed in the quantum Hall effect with the help of 
a Schroedinger-based process, which is confessed to be inherently statistical 
in nature. In the context of the here-chosen period integral approach, the 
ratio (n/s) of the quantum numbers n and s is provided by experiment with 
great precision. The chances of individually measuring with precision (ns), 
or n and s, have so far looked slim. The two methods of theoretical 
assessment amount to a conceptual trade-off. The transition from 
Schroedinger process to period integral method dispenses with a number of 
ad hoc assumptions that are necessary to make the Schroedinger approach 
work (e.g., fractional charges or empty orbital sites).

CHAPTER X
A TALE OF FINE STRUCTURE COINCIDENCES
1. 
Summary
Here is an odyssey in the realm of spectral secrets of Nature's simplest 
atom. A modification of Weber's force function, recently proposed by 
Phipps as an alternative to the Coulomb potential gives a fine structure of 
twice the observed amount. Yet the two relativistic approaches by 
Sommerfeld and Dirac, with or without this Weber-Phipps modification, 
both give the observed fine structure splitting, except for higher order 
differences in even powers of a. Pauli's approximation, however, in 
conjunction with the electron's magnetic moment anomaly, gives, by far, 
the best agreement with experimental observation. The major reason may 
well be that it permits, in addition to a correction for the comoving 
nucleus, also odd powers of such as introduced by the accurately known 
magnetic moment anomaly of the electron. An inspection of the traditional 
QED calculations of the Lamb shift reveals for s-states a residual distance 
of effective proximity between electron and nucleus. Model-based 
interpretations of this residual distance leave many open questions.
2. Introduction
One would think that a particle moving in a central field might be one 
of the most exhaustively treated topics in the physics literature. In taking 
this conclusion for granted, one would therefore hardly expect modifica­
tions that could contribute much in terms of deeper physical insight. 
Nevertheless, even this early and great breakthrough of modem science is 
by no means a closed chapter in the contemporary annals of physics. It has 
retained a multitude of questions that today are of as much interest as in the 
days of Newton.
In the course of time, the extension from one- and two-body situations 
to three- and more body situations have presented very serious hurdles in 
obtaining closed-form solutions that could give an immediate insight in the 
stability of such compound structures. Over and above, the formidable 
mathematical obstacles presented by more bodies carried over into the 
modem realms of relativity and quantum theory. Hence, notwithstanding 
these latter day revolutions, some problems have not changed.
151

152
CHAPTER X
After Newton's fundamental solution for the case of the ideal inverse 
square law, the most commonly considered variations of the classic 
planetary problem have to do with changes in the force law, say due to 
deviations in the ideal inverse square law, changes due to proximity effects 
or perturbations due to other gravitating bodies, and, last but not least, 
interactions with rigid body dynamics and continuum mechanics due to the 
finite size of the interacting objects. In dealing with these matters, Euler, 
Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi have given Newtonian theory its 
mathematically and physically most-sophisticated form, a form which 
subsequently was found to be almost ideally suited for accommodating the 
subsequent developments of relativity and quantum theories.
The great Newtonian breakthrough in mechanics ironically was made 
possible by the introduction of a hybrid conceptual feature. The mixed use 
of field and particle notions provided a major key to solving problems in 
celestial mechanics. The kinematic aspects of the theory are particle-based, 
yet the force interaction between particles or bodies is based on the use of 
what has become known as a field concept. This situation prevails for 
gravitational as well as for electrical interactions of the Coulomb type.
In one of his later publications, Brillouin 1 called attention to this 
dichotomy associated with the notions of kinetic and potential energy. 
While the kinetic energy of a particle can be clearly associated with an 
isolated particle, the potential energy, by contrast, is always a mutual affair 
of the particle and objects creating a "field" at the location of the particle. 
Yet Newtonian treatments have, in the course of time, led to a tacit con­
vention in which kinetic and potential energy are uniquely related to one 
and the same particle. Kinetic energy relates to a given inertial frame, and 
could be said to be defined with respect to the rest of the universe.
When the field concept first was introduced by Newton for dealing with 
his universal law of gravitation, it was the first mathematical coding of 
what then was called an "action at a distance," as distinguished from the 
more familiar contact forces. Newton concluded this action at a distance to 
be a fact of nature, without extensive considerations as to how this action at 
a distance might come about physically. Except, perhaps, for an added 
presumption of instantaneous interaction between two physically separated 
locations in space, there were no further specifications as to what might be 
taking place in the space between the objects. In the course of time, 
Coulomb and Ampere were destined to add new examples testifying to 
nature’s ability to act over distance without the need for an explicitly 
observable physical contact.
When the development of Maxwell theory taught us to identify the 
Coulomb and Ampere forces as near-field manifestations of a general, 
time-delayed, radiation field, it was bound to affect the earlier thesis of 
action at a distance. For the Coulomb and Ampere forces, at least, new 

A TALE OF FINE STRUCTURE COINCIDENCES
153
properties were identified, yet no mechanism of how an action at a distance 
might come about. Maxwell added the feature that action at a distance 
might not be instantaneous, but instead takes time to propagate from one 
place to another.
Later, Einstein's suggestion for the existence of gravitational waves 
indicated that a similar situation might also prevail for the action at a dis­
tance associated with gravity. Hence from a thesis of pure instantaneous 
action at a distance, without further concern of how it comes about, the 
presently prevailing opinions hold that also these near-field manifestations 
take time to get from one place to the other.
At this point, no further questions shall be pursued as to how an 
instantaneous or delayed action at a distance could conceivably be 
understood. Instead of speculating in terms of more explicit concepts of a 
pseudo contact interaction, say, in terms of invisible or imponderable ex­
change objects, attempts at trying to know more about the force properties 
seem more appropriate. Hence, prior to lifting such ideas out of the realm 
of speculation into the realm of physical reality, it is better to stay closer to 
more realizable objectives by first optimizing assessable knowledge about 
force behavior.
Man's tendency to escape the realities of the present, by taking flight 
into a realm of wild, though, interesting imagination, is naturally restricted 
if there is a lack of tools for navigating those uncharted waters. As a case 
in point, questions could be asked whether or not the object-field 
interaction depends on the mutual motion of the object and field source. If 
an orbiting charged particle is taken to create a magnetic moment, does that 
particle interact with the magnetic field creating that moment? Normally, 
it is presumed to have no effect, unless the particle itself is taken to have a 
magnetic moment.
It is possible to address the situation in a different manner and rephrase 
the concomitant question. The Coulomb law is originally viewed as an 
interaction between two stationary charges. On what basis are we allowed 
to assume that this force interaction is not affected by a mutual motion of 
those charges? It can indeed hardly be denied that such extrapolations are 
in part untested. At best, conclusions obtained therefrom can, in retrospect, 
establish a viability of such an extrapolation.
In the following, the pseudo-planetary situation envisioned by the 
structure of hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom is to be analyzed for a 
number of variations of the assumed Coulomb interaction potential. 
Subsequently, these variations are subjected to the dictates of relativity, 
leading to, all told, four major cases. Two of these cases lead to nearly 
indistinguishable copies of the famous hydrogen fine structure, leaving 
some open questions as to what theoretical approach is most favored by the 
available experimental observations.

154
CHAPTER X
The mathematical machinery used for the analysis is that of Hamilton- 
Jacobi. This procedure remains user-friendly in relativistic as well as in 
nonrelativistic cases, because, as essentially shown by Einstein,2 the 
Hamilton equations of motion express the fact that the spacetime dif­
ferential one-form of energy-momentum is closed. The fact that this one- 
form is closed and not exact leaves open the possibility of nonzero 
periods (e.g., residues) for its period integrals (chapter 6; 2)
In the just mentioned paper, Einstein^ also points out how the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld choice of azimuthal and radial cyclic quantized phase integrals 
coincides with the choice of two period integrals as basis elements 
characterizing the topological features of a toroidal-type orbital manifold. 
The spacetime general invariance of the Hamilton-Jacobi process is hereby 
secured, because the property of a spacetime one-form of being closed is a 
spacetime topologically invariant feature.
From this point on, let us theoretically experiment with different types 
of potential functions, which are then combined with relativistic and 
nonrelativistic kinematic potentials. It does not matter too much if the 
Lagrangian combinations of the two transformationally incompatible 
potentials cannot all be integrated into a coherent spacetime, generally 
invariant process. The generally invariant process merely reduces to a 
subgroup invariance that may still appear to be of practical relevance.
For the sake of easy reference and for retaining a convenient overview, 
it is appropriate to start out with the classic case initiated by Bohr for 
circular orbits and later extended to elliptic orbits by Sommerfeld, Wilson, 
Epstein and others.3 Since this procedure is based on an assumption, which 
extrapolates the static Coulomb potential unchanged to orbital situations, let 
it be referred to as the kinematically uncorrected Coulomb process.
3. Case I, Coulomb Potential Nonrelativistic
While this example is elaborately treated in many textbooks, here are 
some appropriate highlights for the purpose of subsequent reference. The 
Lagrangian function L is here defined as:
L = |mv2 - U, 
1
whereby m=mass of electron; v=velocity
v2= r2 + r2<j>2 with r and <t> polar coordinates, 
2
U = - k/r, the static Coulomb potential, 
3
k = e2 the electronic charge squared in cgs units and k = e2/47T€0 for MKS 
units, possibly multiplied by the nuclear charge number Z. The explicit 
evaluations are here done for the hydrogen case; the nuclear charge 
number is therefore taken as Z=l.

155
The generalized momenta are obtained by using the lagrangian 
definition pA = 3L/3qA. They thus lead to the following explicit 
expressions:
4
pr=mr,
P4, = mr24> , 
5
with the help of the Legendre transformation H= pv - L, one finds for the 
Hamilton energy expression:
1
H = £ mv2 +U, 
6
which, after eliminating v with the help of Eqs .4 and 5, can be converted 
into the Hamilton-Jacobi form :
Pr2 +r'2p4>2 = 2m(H - U). 
7
Since L does not depend on 4>, the momentum p^ is a constant of the mo­
tion and is taken to obey the Bohr-Sommerfeld residue condition 
f p^ =lh, 
8
so for a 2k orbit 
p^LTi, with l = 0,1,2,3..... 9
The momentum pr is not a constant of the motion, hence here the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld integral has to be explicitly evaluated. Substituting Eqs.3 and 9 
into 7 and solving for pr yields the other Bohr-Sommerfeld integral

For this cyclic integral the + sign of the integrand is taken for the out

thus closing the cycle. This integral, and the following we shall encounter 
for the other three cases, are all of the following type, for which the magic 
of complex integration4 gives the solution given by Eq.ll:

mk 
n ti =-L1r +

and, after solving for H and writing a = k/7ic as the fine structure con­
stant, one obtains the familiar energy expression given by Eq. 14.

15
There is no fine structure!
4. Case II, Coulomb-Weber Potential Nonrelativistic
Phipps^ recently has called attention to a kinematic correction of the 
Coulomb potential suggested by Weber as early as in 1834. Weber also is 
known for discovering that the vacuum speed of light is related to the ratio 
of the electrostatic and magnetostatic units of charge. Writing down the 
Lagrangian for the hydrogen atom and taking into account a Weber 
correction we may consider the modification
L = |mv2-u[l - |(v/c)2], 
16
in which U is again the static coulomb potential.
Following the standard rules of Hamiltonian mechanics the generalized 
momenta are now
pr=(m + U/c2) r, 
17
P4> = (m + U/c2) r2$ . 
18
With the help of the Legendre transformation one obtains from Eqs. 16, 
17 and 18 the Hamiltonian energy expression
1
H = £ (m + ll/c2) +U ,
which, after eliminating v between Eqs. 16,17 and 18, yields the Hamilton- 
Jacobi form:
Pr2 +f-2p<j>2 = 2(m + U/c2)(H - U) 
19
Since p^ is a constant of the motion, the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition 
permits us to use Eq.8. For the radial Bohr-Sommerfeld condition we 
now have to solve the integral
fprdr = f ±^2(m + U/c2)(H-U)-(lh)2r-2 dr = nh . 
20
Now substituting for U the electrostatic value given by Eq.3, the ex­
pression under the root sign of Eq.20 is again of the form given by Eq.ll, 
but now with the different A,B,C values
A= 2mH; B= k(m - H/c2); C= (L1h)2+2(k/c)2 = (h)2 (L2+ 2a2) 
21

157
Eq. 11 now gives for H the equation
k(m-H/c2) 
^-2mH
a/12 + 2<>2 =
22
n +
In the the previous case, by squaring this analogue of Eq. 13, a linear 
equation in H was obtained. This time, because of the H term in the 
numerator, one obtains, when writing N for the left hand side of Eq.22, the 
following quadratic equation in H:
H2-2mc2(l-N2/o2)h + m2c4 =0 
23
with roots:
Htj2 = mc2(1 - N2/*2) ± mc2(1 - IN2/*2) v/1 -(1 -N2/*2)'2. 
24
Rejecting the root associated with the plus sign as injected by the process 
of squaring, the remaining physically significant root for m»H/c2 
already is evident from Eq.22:
H ~ - -me2 ---------—----------- 25
2 
(n+ ^l2 + 2*2)2 ’
Comparison with Eq. 14 of case I shows that n and 1 now have slightly 
different contributions to the energy states, indicating the existence of a 
spectroscopic fine structure. A subsequent comparison with the now fol­
lowing relativistic cases will show that the fine-structure separation 
given by the term formula Eq.25 is twice as big as the one 
spectroscopically observed.
5. Case III, Sommerfeld's Calculation
This calculation is one of the first applications of relativistic mechanics 
to atomic structure. In Sommerfeld's procedure a static Coulomb potential 
is combined with a relativistic correction of the kinetic energy part. One 
thus obtains for the Lagrangian:
L = - me2 a/i-(v/c)2 - U . 
26
The corresponding generalized momenta are found to be

Case IV, Combining Weber Correction and Relativity
In the same paper in which Phipps^ calls attention to the 1834 Weber 
potential-energy correction, he proposes to rewrite the combination of 
Coulomb and Weber term as
U[l - |tv/c)2 ]-♦ U y/l-(v/c)2 • 
34
Together with a relativistic kinetic-energy term, the Lagrangian now as­
sumes the form
L = - (me2 + U) ->/l-(v/c)2 , 
35
which leads to the following energy-momentum expressions:

Unlike the Eqs.27-29, the Eqs. 36 indicate by contrast that the particle and 
field components of energy-momentum are equally affected by the 
Lorentz-type term a/ 1-(v/c)2. This removes a transformational dichotomy 
remaining in the Sommerfeld-Dirac choice of the Lagrangian Eq.26.
Eliminating v between Eqs.36, the Hamilton-Jacobi form becomes:

40 Unlike Eq.33, Eq.40 permits the so-called s orbits "through" the 
nucleus if the azimuthal quantum number I is taken to be zero.
Case IV has not previously been the subject of a Dirac equation 
approach. The following may suffice to dispel lingering doubts about the 
relevance of this spinless semi-classical treatment. A Dirac analysis based 
on Eq.37 indeed reproduces also the revised term formula Eq.40. 
(Similarly as in the original Sommerfeld-Dirac transition, spin and orbital 
moment are taken to be additive. Spin is introduced by the quantum 
number transition L-»J = L+|. Details of the Dirac procedure, as modified 
by the Weber-Phipps Lagrangian, are given in section 8 of this chapter.
7. Discussion
The here-undertaken project of reconsidering motion-induced force 
corrections did in fact emerge as a prerequisite, or as a byproduct if you 
will, of an intended investigation of force corrections due to proximity 
effects between interacting objects. Since object motion is enhanced by 
object proximity, it would appear essential to acquire, if at all possible, 
independent information of these two effects. On the grounds that motion- 
induced force corrections constitute a common element of classical and 
nonclassical theory, a classical approach not only is appropriate, but even 
necessary. Methodological convenience then prompted the use of Bohr- 
Sommerfeld conditions for obtaining quantum information, which in case 
IV, has been reconfirmed by Dirac methods (compare section 8).
The major point submitted to reconsideration in this investigation is the 
question: should particle and field energy-momentum be taken to follow 
the same transformation rules? While offhand many of us might be 
inclined to confirm this step, the fact is that, by the same token, many of us 
have, in the course of time, accepted exemptions to this rule. Earlier this 
century, nobody less than Sommerfeld and Dirac have tacitly exempted 
field energy-momentum from motion-induced changes. Subsequently, the 

160
CHAPTER X
textbook literature consolidated this exemption without much further 
justification.
Even when taking into account a possibly hidden undisclosed logic 
justifying said exemption, after having been alerted to this situation, a 
reconsideration is presently called for and should be one of respectfully 
submitting this matter to further scrutiny. Mindful that the recognized 
hybrid nature of the energy-momentum one-form might limit the solidity 
of a very hard-nosed transformational argument, the method of discussion 
here adopted deemphasizes spacetime transformation and uses instead a 
form of theoretical experimentation. Let us consider, in this spirit, the 
four cases treated here by weighing virtues against inadequacies.
A comparison of the cases I and III has led in the literature to a diver­
sity of lore, or convention, if you will. For nX), an azimuthal quantum 
number 1=0 yields in case I, a well-defined energy state for Eq. 14, even 
though U-+oo. Yet. the fact is that Eq.33 of case III yields, under the same 
circumstances, a complex energy state. Some may even regard this behav­
ior difference for the term formula Eqs. 14 and 33 as a sign of inner wis­
dom of the relativistic approach; it knows how to avoid pendle orbits going 
through the nuclear center.
However, while the just-given rationale might suit the relativists, the 
fact is that nonrelativistic Schroedinger treatments welcomed the nonclassi- 
cal equivalent of a classical pendle orbit as a rather feasible proposition. 
Pendle orbits were said to be typically "nonclassical" characterizations 
identified as "s-states." Spectroscopic observations subsequently revealed 
slight energy shifts of these suspected pendle orbits. Using radar tech­
nology, the shifts were then measured with great accuracy by Lamb et al. 
The first successful calculations of this Lamb shift associated this phe­
nomenon with perturbations in the Coulomb potential due to electron-pro­
ton proximity. The functions of these so-called s-states, at the origin, 
have been crucial for calculating those energy perturbations!
The conceptual relation between fine structure and Lamb shift, although 
still obscure, thus might be said to be slightly improved if motion-induced 
corrections are taken into account according to Eq.40. In addition the 
pendle orbit 1=0 now again is a physically feasible proposition. Yet it 
raises new questions. The absence of an orbital moment for the s-state 
requires a proximity shift offsetting the vanishing spectral shift due to spin. 
Whether a remaining net effect accounts for the Lamb shift needs 
investigation. An empirical proximity proposition can, in principle, always 
meet such objective!
When seen in a classical context, the fine structure relates to a preces­
sion of elliptical orbits. Since case III dictates an advancing precession, it 
follows that the precession for case II is retrograde at twice the rate at 

A TALE OF FINE STRUCTURE COINCIDENCES
161
which case III precesses in forward direction. For case IV, the relativity 
correction of the kinetic energy and the motion-induced potential energy 
corrections are both taken into account. Since the potential energy correc­
tion gives a precession at twice the rate of the relativity correction, the re­
maining net precession is retrograde at the same rate at which the relativity 
precession of case III advances in opposite direction. The fine-structure 
separation presumably gives only information about the magnitude, but not 
about sign of the orbital precession.
Where do we now stand? Further conclusions ought to wait for Lamb 
shift evaluations based on proximity corrections, possibly in conjunction 
with omitting spin-orbit level shifts for the s-states. For a more complete 
picture of the fine structure of hydrogen-like atoms, we discuss in section 8 
whether the Dirac approach for the Weber-Phipps Lagrangian indeed con­
firms Eq.40. In section 10, the Pauli approximation is reviewed. Its agree­
ment with experimental observation is numerically superior by considering 
the co-moving nucleus and the electron's anomalous moment. Finally, a 
possible lifting of the degeneracy between s and p states according to Eq.40 
is reexamined in section 11 from the point of view of the Pauli approxima­
tion, because, unlike the Sommerfeld and Dirac procedures, the Pauli ap­
proximation permits us to deal explicitly with the spin-orbit level shifts due 
to the electron’s magnetic moment anomaly and their expected effect on s 
and p states.
8. Dirac Approach for Weber-Phipps Lagrangian
Since the Dirac and Schroedinger equations are transcripts of the 
Hamilton-Jacobi equations, it follows that the Dirac equation, on the basis 
of the Sommerfeld-Dirac Lagrangian, should tie in with Eq.30 (i.e., case 
III in the previous section 6).
7 
7 7 (H-U)2-m2c4
Pr +r P<|>--------~z------ (Dirac). 
(30)
It then follows that the Dirac equation modified by the Weber-Phipps 
Lagrangian would have to correspond with case IV treated in section 7, 
thus leading us to Eq. 37:
7 
7 7 H2-(mc2 + U)2
Pr +r P<t> =------ ^2------- (modified) (37)
A comparison of Eqs.(30) and (37) shows that the structural differences 
between the two are solely in the right-hand members; in Eq.(30), U com­
bines with H; in Eq.(37) U combines with me2. Yet both right hand mem­
bers are differences of squares, which is important for the Dirac decom­
position.

162
CHAPTER X
The wave equations for the radial components of the two component 
spinor functions F and G are, according to Dirac:^
d J + 1 H-U-mc2 
dr + r 1 F = he 6
d j-1 H-U + mc2 
dT r )G-—he 
F
(30a)
(30b)
In Eqs. 30a&b, j is the azimuthal quantum number, which is here taken to 
account for orbital and spin moment. The eigenvalues H of these two 
equations are given in reference 5. They are found to reproduce Eq.33 if 
the azimuthal quantum number I is replaced by the spin orbit number j, 
which is taken to assume values L±l/2.
Making the transcription from Eq.37 instead of Eq.30, we need to 
account for the change in the right-hand member, which leads to a pair of 
radial differential equations slightly different from the previous pair:
d J + 1 
dr r
H-U-mc2
(37a)
d J-1 H + U + mc2
~ ^dr + r ’ G = he F ’
(37b)
Now we need to check whether or not the eigenvalues H of Eqs. 37a &b 
indeed reproduce the term formula Eq.40. Following the same procedure 
as outlined by Dirac^ for the previous case, we make the substitutions:
F(r) = r~'e'r’a f(r) and G(r) = r’'e"r/a g(r) , 
41
in which the parameter a in the exponentials can be chosen for later 
algebraic convenience. For the functions f and g, we obtain the differ- 
erential equations:

have been substituted. They are here taken in cgs units, so as to retain 
alignment with reference 6. Hence
U = - e2/r 
44
and the cgs version of the fine structure constant then is
a = e2/'hc. 
45
Power series solutions of Eqs. 42
f(r)=^csrs and g(r) = ^c'srs

lead to the recursive relations:
(s+J)cs + cs-1/a = Re's-! +orc's 
47a
(s-j)c's +c's-i/a = Bcs-i + acs 
4 7b
Standard regularity conditions for wave functions require f and g to be 
polynomials, thus implying for s a lowest number so where the series start 
and a highest value where they terminate. For Cs0 and c's0 ,the lowest 
order nonzero terms in the power series 46, cs0-l and c's0-l are zero. 
Hence Eqs. 47 reduce to
°fC's0 - (s0+J)Cs0 = 0 
48a
(So-j)c'so- acSo = 0, 
48b
the compatibility of which yields:
s02 = j2**2 . 
49
Let the power series Eq.46 terminate for some power, say s-1, the
coefficients c$ and c's then vanish and the Eqs .47 yield a relation which 
determines the parameter or as:
AB = Or'2 . 
50
Eliminating from Eqs.47 the coefficients completely with the help of these 
relations, one finally ends up after some algebra with the expression:
R + B
2S = O'—51
-yRB
Substituting the expressions Eq.43 defining A and B one finds, after some 
further algebra, the expression, where s (instead of s-1) has now been taken 
to be the number for which the series terminate
I a2
H = mc2A/1-77 .

52 Since s has to equal So (defined by Eq.49) plus an integer, say n, we 
have

substitution of which in Eq.52 leads to a the term formula Eq.40a, equal to 
Eq.40 after replacing orbital number I by j.

In consideration of their complexity, one should never cease to be 
amazed that two methods as different as the Bohr-Sommerfeld and Dirac 
procedures, end up giving identical end results. For some reason, one feels 
they should have a simpler and physically more transparent common 
denominator that somehow has not yet reached our awareness.
9. The Pauli Approximation
It is a near-contradictory feature of the Dirac procedure that its 
identification of the electron spin does not lead to an explicit electron 
magnetic moment in the result for the energy levels as given by the fine 
structure formula Eq.40a. Spin, in this final result, has become a rather la­
tent feature. The question now arises how to account in the Dirac process 
for the observed and well established anomaly in the electron's magnetic 
moment (e/m)h/2-» (e/m)(1+ o'/2iT + ....)1n/2 . Since Eq.40a yields only 
even powers of a, it must be judged to be at a loss to account for these 
matters, because the first and biggest electron moment anomaly term 
already gives an odd power of oc.
In the Dirac procedure an explicit magnetic moment term only appears 
when an external magnetic induction is imposed. Seen in this light, the rea­
son for this seemingly contradictory feature has to do with the fact that, in 
the normal fine structure, the electron's magnetic moment interacts with 
the magnetic induction generated by its own orbital motion. The Weber- 
Phipps potential can be regarded as a striking example, producing a kine­
matically generated magnetic induction. Yet, as detailed in the previous 
sections, an analysis of its fine structure revealed twice the observed split­
ting unless the calculation is combined with a relativity induced splitting.
The history of fine structure is replete with factors "2." A very inge­
nious method for tracking down such factors has been discussed by 
Thomas7 By dynamically composing two Lorentz transformations, which 
is "slightly" outside the domain of the Lorentz group, he could identify a 
(Thomas) precession and an associated 1/2 presently known as the Thomas 
factor. Instead of using relativity and/or the Dirac process for trimming 
down the double Weber-Phipps splitting, one could use the slightly more 
apocryphal Thomas factor for obtaining the same result; after all, all three 
options (Bohr-Sommerfeld, Dirac and Thomas) have a relativity origin.

A TALE OF FINE STRUCTURE COINCIDENCES
165
However, instead of chasing factors 1/2, which are hereby identified as 
more or less of relativistic origin, we should now be chasing the much 
smaller factor ce/2iT? due to the moment anomaly. To do so, we first need 
to identify the role of the electron magnetic moment and then we make it 
explicit by rewriting the Hamiltonian and rederiving the fine structure. 
Pauli8 has done exactly this by injecting a magnetic dipole term in the 
Schroedinger equation and calculating its impact with the help of 
perturbation theory. The results of these calculations are consistent with the 
relativity based calculations for powers of a2 and a4. Without going 
through the details of a perturbation calculation one can fairly easily verify 
these matters for the principal quantum number n=2.
If the energy contribution due to the magnetic moment is taken to be pB 
(p is the magnetic moment and B is the effective magnetic induction 
generated by the orbital motion), the Dirac value for p is (e/m)ti/2 and 
B = -(v/c2)E if E is the local value of the electric field E=k/er2, with k 
defined as e2 cgs units or e2/4ffe0 in MKS. Using the familiar data of a 
Bohr circle orbit the level shift can now be written as
pB = (e/m)(b/2) (v/c2)(k/e)r'2 = (h/2m)oom (<*/n)2 .
Bohr orbit calculations give go = mk2/(nh)3; hence substitution gives as 
energy jump associated with the spin flip
lb = 2pB = me2 a4 rr5 . 
54
Eq.40 gives for n the principal quantum number and I the azimuthal 
quantum number, when keeping n constant, as energy jump lb' associated 
with the transition I -»1-1 the expression
a|,4mc2o'4RsnH) 
55
Eqs.54 and 55 give equal energy jumps lb' = lb for n=2, a fact which 
may here be taken as supporting evidence for a spin flip mechanism un­
derlying the Dirac term formula. Using recent data for the fundamental 
constants, its numerical value is:
Ib/h = 10949.27 Mc/s. 
56
The observed values for hydrogen and deuterium are:9 
t>H = 10968.52 Mc/s 
observed
■vq= 10971.59 Mc/s 
observed 
57
The electron's anomalous moment and the comoving nucleus can in first 
order be accounted for by multiplying Eq.56 with the corrective factor 
(1 + ce/rr - m/M), one thus obtains:
1>H= 10968.73 Mc/s calculated

166
CHAPTER X
•vo= 10971.72 Mc/s calculated 
58
A comparison of the observed and calculated data shows fair agreement 
despite the diversity of theoretical input which is a patch work of Dirac 
theory, QED, relativity and the classical mechanical correction m/M; the 
two body nature of the latter cannot easily be made to fit well the 
principles of relativity.
In fact, closer agreement covering the seventh decimal place still is 
possible by injecting the electron's measured anomaly data listed on p.lll. 
Additional corrections due to higher powers of a2 may be expected to be 
slightly different for the Dirac term formula and the Weber-Phipps- 
modified Dirac term formula. Hence, an even more incisive comparison of 
theory and observation would be necessary to determine whether or not the 
Weber-Phipps modification gives a closer fit. At this point, another fine- 
structure feature needs to be considered. It has become known as the Lamb 
shift. This phenomenon testifies about new seemingly never-ending 
complexity into the workings of the simplest atom.
10. Remaining Lamb Shift Problems
In the early Thirties, the spectroscopic exploration of the hydrogen fine 
structure revealed some very small discrepancies, casting doubts on a 
complete agreement with Dirac theory. The mutual positions of the s and p 
levels became the object of suspicion that led ultimately to a further 
scrutiny. The question was asked whether transitions between the fine- 
structure levels could be observed directly without changing the principal 
quantum number. After the development of radar technology made 
oscillators available in the microwave range, Lamb 10 and co-workers 
succeeded in measuring directly a finite frequency interval of 1062 Mc/s 
between the 2^ and 2pl levels of hydrogen.
From a point of view of the standard Dirac theory, without the Weber- 
Phipps modification, the two cited levels were believed to be degenerate. 
An inspection of Eq.33 shows why. The quantum number I cannot be 
allowed to vanish, because it would lead to complex energy states. The so- 
called s-states of the Schroedinger equation were somewhat tacitly taken to 
correspond to j= L±s with 1 = 0 and s = +1/2 versus L=1 and s=-i/2. Hence, 
the s=+l/2 value for 1=0 rescues the energy from becoming complex.
The just-presented argument is no longer compelling in the light of the 
Dirac theory, as modified by the Weber-Phipps Lagrangian. Eqs .40 and 
40a no longer need the s=+i/2 to rescue the energy from becoming 
complex. It now is possible to consider s-states in the sense as originally 
envisioned for the Schroedinger equation by taking l=J=0. If, for s-states, 

A TALE OF FINE STRUCTURE COINCIDENCES
167
the orbital magnetic moment reduces to zero, how, in the perspective of the 
Pauli approximation, could a finite spin term be justified?
Yet, another feature of the Dirac theory, as modified by the Weber- 
Phipps Lagrangian, needs to be mentioned. For Eq.40, the L = J=0 option 
lifts the earlier cited degeneracy for the original Dirac theory governed by 
Eq.37. The s-states now exhibit substantial shifts.

the corresponding Bohr circular orbit without spin L—► n is also lifted
I
In the light of the Dirac theory with the modified Lagrangian, the 
question may be asked whether the Lamb shift can now be regarded as a 
difference between a p-state shifted by spin and an s-state without spin. A 
numerical evaluation does not confirm this option and keeps pointing at a 
Coulomb proximity effect.
The standard QED process for obtaining the Lamb shift is, in essence, 
based on the calculation of an effective Coulomb distance of proximity Sr 
by having the electron hop around as a result of interaction with the zero­
point energy of vacuum. Since this energy would be infinite for an 
unlimited spectrum, QED provides a rationale for a finite spectrum 
interval co1-*co2 to obtain a finite Sr. The expression for its square 
average so obtained is given as
<Sr>2 = (2<x/Tr) (h/mc)2 ln(co2/coi). 
59
Hence, instead of going to zero, the minimum distance between electron 
and proton is dr. This will affect the potential energy between the two. 
The ensuing energy level change SID is then calculated by perturbation 
theory, using the s-state wave function for the unperturbed state. This 
calculation then gives the observed shift of 1062 Mc/s.
These QED calculations have been a target of much criticism for many 
reasons. There remains a measure of arbitrariness in the selection of the 
effective spectrum interval. Furthermore, the perturbation calculation is 
performed near a singularity of the Coulomb field and uses the wave 
function of the Schroedinger s-state at the origin. This proximity-shifted 
Schroedinger s-state, presumably without spin-shift, is ironically then 

168
CHAPTER X
compared with a spin-shifted Dirac p-state so as to give the observed Lamb 
result.
KramersJ 1 who, in part, suggested some of the QED methods that have 
been used over the past decades, is known to have expressed an opinion that 
it would be very difficult indeed to make these procedures rigorous. So, 
after all this time, the hydrogen atom still is giving us troubles from the 
QED angle as well as from the wave-equation angle. The Lamb shift 
proves to be a much more complicated situation than the electron's 
anomalous moment. A model-based analysis of the latter, accounting for its 
principal features, invokes the modeling of only one particle; the Lamb­
shift, by contrast, requires a modeling of two distinct particles.
A model-based Lamb-shift calculation needs to combine spin-orbital 
fine structure with a Coulomb proximity effect, plus a spin-spin electron­
nucleus interaction for the s-levels. Hence the Lamb-shift, in principle, 
demands model specifications of two particles as well as a specification of 
the proximity behavior ensuing from the chosen models. While the idea 
that standard QED can do all this in a model-independent manner has a 
pleasing simplicity, the fact that this unusual result can be accomplished 
only by sacrificing a good measure of mathematical rigor and explicit 
physical transparency and precision remains a matter of concern.

CHAPTER XI
CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
1. 
Summary
Model-based experimentations with globally oriented classical and semi- 
classical methods have retained a viability in the microphysical realm, de­
spite the prevalence of the abstract methods of contemporary quantum 
physics. In chapter VIII, these model-based methods were found to empha­
size the electron's purely electromagnetic origin. While the Lorentz elec­
tron was purely electrostatic, the energy of the Dirac electron was purely 
magnetic, yet nature's electron, by contrast, appears to be a blending of the 
two. The joint presence of electric and magnetic energy was found to relate 
to the magnetic moment anomaly.
The electron's half spin, normally identified as a consequence of ab­
stract local spin description, becomes, when seen from a global angle, a 
consequence of a forced 4k integration path inherent to the electron model, 
which is taken to be a trefoil.
From the angle of the trefoil model, the magnetic moment anomaly (not 
covered by Dirac theory) is found to consist of two contributions of op­
posite sign. In chapter VIII a positive component was already identified as 
due to reinstating the now residual role of its electrostatic energy. A much 
smaller, not earlier mentioned, negative anomaly component is due to a 
small flux leakage into an internally closed path, which detracts from the 
full flux unit h/e required by the Aharonov-Bohm integral. The trefoil's 
orbital knot here amounts to a meridional current component generating a 
toroidal flux. The latter closes on itself and detracts from exterior manifes­
tation of the experimentally observable flux.
2. Introduction
To many people, the almost century-old transition from "classical" to 
"nonclassical" physics was felt as a gradual sacrifice of visualizable contact 
with the subject matter. Relativity brought a measure of discomfort of hav­
ing to depict things in spacetime. Uncertainty in quantum mechanics de­
prived us of obtaining visualizable images of the microphysical world. 
Compounding the hurdles on the traditional road to cognizance is a widely 
spread sentiment that the cited restrictions are in the nature of things.
169

170
CHAPTER XI
Man's innate limitations and his general position in the order of things are 
more and more accepted as frontiers beyond which advancement is bound 
to become difficult, if not impossible.
The increasing preference for formal descriptions over the seemingly 
futile attempts at visualization may be regarded as public testimony con­
firming the cited trend of giving up geometric modelling, where the human 
eye, and even its modem experimental extensions, can no longer see. 
During the time when such developments are in progress, it is always diffi­
cult to judge where the hurdles are real, and where they are mainly 
psychological. Hence in the process of educating a new generation in the 
fundamentals of physics, it can hardly be avoided that along with sound and 
solid knowledge, a few prejudices are also passed along from generation to 
generation. It is the prerogative of the new generation to identify those 
prejudices and replace them with better and more circumspect premises 
leaving more of a horizon for further explorations.
The here-presented material attempts (1) to identify prejudices and 
(2) to open up possible pathways that become available as a result. 
Preparing an audience to make the classical-nonclassical transition, instruc­
tors are frequently tempted to play up the classical versus nonclassical 
distinction beyond the point of necessity. In the following, we pinpoint 
some of these instances by determining the seemingly extended viability of 
some classical relations in the realm normally reserved for nonclassical 
methodology.
The exploration of this subject matter is done by examining the inter­
play between classical and nonclassical, covering relations in both do­
mains. While, without question, many nonclassical methods deserve credit 
for first explorations in the microphysical realm, attempts at reproducing 
these results, after the facts, by simpler, more tangible procedures has its 
virtues, even if they are only taken as mnemonic devices.
3. An Historic Perspective on the Electron
More than any other particle, the electron has been the subject of classi­
cal and nonclassical theorizing. Lorentz tentatively saw the electron as a 
charged sphere of purely electrostatic energy. The Einstein mass-energy 
theorem then gave it its Lorentz radius of r= e2p0/47Tm in MKS units. To 
secure the stability of this system, Poincare postulated the existence of 
stresses preventing such charge structures from flying apart.
The existence of a fundamental quantum of electronic charge had be­
come more and more apparent in the course of the 19th century. Faraday's 
law of electrolytic deposit as being proportional to current, chemical va­
lence and atomic weight was a first tell-tale sign. Later, findings with cath­
ode ray tubes and Millikan's oildrop experiment further secured the 
knowledge about charge and mass of the electron.

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
171
More on grounds of history than on the basis of logical need has the 
existence of charge quantization been treated as an item of information be­
longing mostly in the realm of classical physics. Formally speaking, the 
notion of nonclassical physics started at the turn of the century, with 
Planck's introduction of a quantum of action. Once the first step had been 
made on the path of unconventional conceptualization, others followed and 
reached a culmination point in the birth of modem quantum mechanics in 
the late Twenties.
Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom first related Planck's quantum of 
action to electron behavior. Normal and later unexpected anomalous elec­
tron behavior in magnetic fields led then to a decision to endow electrons 
with spin and magnetic moment, over-and-above the earlier identified 
charge and mass.
A few years later, these new electron attributes became the subject of a 
wave-equation description by Dirac. If anything in particular had to be 
mentioned as having further consolidated the classical/nonclassical distinc­
tion, it was the ensuing theory of spinors, which contributed a major share. 
In the Dirac theory spin and magnetic moment of the electron were 
magically produced by the imposition of utterly formal requirements, 
which seemed to have no bearing at all on any visualizable model of the 
electron. Insistence on Lorentz invariance and linearity in the energy-mo­
mentum parameters were the principal conceptual ingredients that led to 
this most amazing achievement in theoretical physics.
Dirac's theory was instrumental in bringing about, and in consolidating 
a philosophical change in the approach to physics that had been earlier 
promoted by Heisenberg. Rather than modelling geometrically what we 
could not see, the new attitude became more pragmatic and settled for de­
scribing in a logically consistent manner what could be observed. In the 
light of those experiences, it seemed wise to restrict theory to experimental 
observables in the sense of Heisenberg and then find rules Nature is willing 
to disclose for working with these observables. Dirac's theory remains one 
of the amazing monuments which demonstrates how effective such an ap­
proach can be.
Yet, depending on the situation at hand, also logical consistency has its 
limitations for getting to the truth. In the past the electron had been iden­
tified by two characteristic dimensions: the Lorentz radius and the 137- 
times-bigger Compton radius. The new radicalism, which had been 
emerging with the Copenhagen interpretation, had the audacity of favoring 
a point-electron.
No name is specifically associated with this plea for a point-electron. 
Everybody knew, deep in his conscience, that a bit of common sense had 
gone overboard. The idea sort of emerged anonymously as a tongue-in- 
cheek consequence of the Copenhagen statistical interpretation.

172
CHAPTER XI
Even the radicals refrained from boldly claiming responsibility for this 
conceptual outrage. After more incisive inquiry, one finds a consensus to 
the effect that a point-electron is something one ought to be able to live 
with, at least for the time being. Where do we go from here?
Let us keep in mind that it may be better not to put all of our eggs into 
one basket. Granted, for more than half a century, the formal abstract 
method of approach held an edge over the more explicit modelling 
approach. Does that mean that the old-fashioned type of modelling is now 
beyond redemption and should be abandoned altogether? We shall find that 
some minor, or, depending on the mind of the beholder, not-so-minor 
changes in modelling can restore a mutually beneficial complementary 
exchange between modelling and abstraction.
4. An Assessment of Formal Equivalences
Let us compare, in this section, a number of familiar expressions from 
classical electromagnetic theory with the corresponding counterparts of 
nonclassical theory. They are expressions for magnetic moment, energy, 
magnetic flux and last, but not least, the Larmor theorem calling on a most 
important equivalence between rotation and magnetic induction. The rele­
vant expressions are here given in terms of an MKS type unit rendition.
The MKS choice is not without reason, because, in the course of discus­
sions, one finds that MKS renditions make some subtle distinctions that are 
missing for cgs. One major point is that MKS renditions don't have the 
vacuum speed of light c popping up in places where it is merely used as a 
factor serving the electrostatic and magnetostatic unit dichotomy within the 
cgs system. This type of factor c has no real functional role relating to the 
physics of the subject matter. Since, in the following, we like to see the 
forest as well as the trees, we do well taking advantage of MKS renditions, 
which have eliminated this c redundancy.
Let us consider the standard formula for the magnetic moment p of a 
ring current J of radius r:
p = rrr2 J . 
1
If e is the amount charge, all of which is circulating at the same rate go , 
the current J can be defined as
J = e co/2tt . 
2
Eq.2 inserted in Eq.l gives an equivalent magnetic moment expression 
p = (1/2) e r2 go . 
3
Eq.3 gives a magnetic moment rendition which is analogous to the def­
inition of angular momentum L in mechanics
L = m r2 co . 
4
Eqs.3,4 give the familiar orbital gyromagnetic ratio p/L= e/2m.

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
173
All of the above is true for reasonably "slender" ring currents, which 
means the r is adequately defined so that e resides on the orbit; e does not 
have to be a point charge, though; it may be smeared out around the orbit.
Now let us do some experimenting by multiplying both sides of Eq.l 
with an effective magnetic induction B generated by the current J:
p B = %r2B J . 
5
Since 7Tr2B is by definition the flux <I> passing through the ring, Eq.5 
simply illustrates a familiar equivalence:
p B = 5>J. 
6
On the left, Eq.6 could represent an interaction energy of p with an exter­
nal field B. However, since B is here supposed to be the B field created by 
p itself, a factor 1/2 would be in order to give the electromagnetic field en­
ergy of the system. Eq.6 may be said to give the sum of field- and mechan­
ical energy, which is in accordance with F. London's analysis of the super­
conducting ring; the kinetic energy of the charge carriers equals the mag­
netic field energy (see p.66 of ref.2 cited in chapter VI of this text).
Now let us experiment with the expression Eq.3 for the magnetic mo­
ment by using the Larmor theorem co = (e/2m) B. Substitution leads to
p = (1/2) e r2 (e/2m) B = (e2/m) rrr2B/4Tr . 
7
Since Kr2B is the earlier-cited flux <I> through the ring, and knowing that 
flux to be quantized, one is now very much tempted to try this out on Eq. 7 
and see where this leads to. Taking the flux unit to be h/e, we have
<t> = jrr2B = h/e . 
8
Note that a unit h/2e, such as observed in superconducting rings, would be 
out of order, because the initial charge e has no companian. Yet the trefoil 
gives a pairing of charges e/2, replacing e-»e/2 in Eq. 12 of chapter VI 
thus justifies Eq. 13, chapter VI. So, substituting Eq.8 into Eq.7 yields
p = (e/2m) h/2rr, 
9
which is the familiar expression for the Bohr magneton and also the mag­
netic moment value ascribed to the electron by the Dirac theory. The ex­
perimentally observed values of the electron's magnetic moment have been 
found to be slightly bigger, a discrepancy that was later accounted for by 
quantum electrodynamics (QED).
The overall result, so far, is that flux quantization generates a familiar 
form of magnetic moment quantization. In other words, if an electron has 
a magnetic moment (e/m)ti/2, where we write ‘h = h/2-n', then that same 
electron also carries a flux unit h/e.
There has always been a suspicion that something of this sort might be 
true. These very elementary considerations give us some added suspicion 
that such an assumption might be based on fact. Fluxes, unlike magnetic 
moments, must be examined in proximity; so chances for observation are 

174
CHAPTER XI
slim. In evaluating the saturation magnetism of ferromagnetic materials, 
Chamberlain^ et al have found some supportive evidence for the order of 
magnitude of these elementary fluxes.
Perhaps encouraged by these preliminaries let us go a step further and 
involve quantum and relativity concepts both. Consider hereto the energy 
relation
me2 = "hco . 
10
Charge moving in a self-field invites using Larmor's theorem for co. 
After comparison with Eq.9 one finds me2 equalling twice the magnetic 
field energy (see Eq.9 of chapter VI and Eq.l chapter VIII)
me2 = 1n (e/2m) B = p B. 
11
According to Eq.6 , Eq.l 1 could be rewritten as
me2 = (l/2)(pB+<&J) = d> J. 
12
Eqs. 11 and 12 represent some sort of an invitation to resurrect Lorentz' 
electromagnetic electron, except that now the energy is all magnetic in 
origin. Lorentz' early model was purely electrostatic; after all, at that time, 
the magnetic spin properties of the electron had not yet been discovered.
If it is indeed permissible to consider, at least tentatively, the electron as 
an electrodynamically based structure, then there is the legitimate question: 
what happened to the electrostatic energy? Presumably one has to assume 
that the electron's energy is mostly magnetic in nature, with a tiny bit of 
electrostatic energy. As shown in the previous chapter, the electron's mag­
netic moment anomaly indeed relates to this very small component of elec­
trostatic energy.
In all the experimentation with well-known formula that we have done 
so far, nothing has been said about the magnitude of r and the actual ve­
locity cor of charge circulation around the ring. It is, all by itself, interest­
ing how much can be said about such electron-like ring currents without 
making any commitment at all about the r or co r. Since co is committed 
by Eq. 10 a commitment about r is a commitment about cor.
It would indeed be unusual if the very specific physical structure, which 
is called an electron, would have a completely indeterminate radius r. The 
velocity of an electron in the first Bohr orbit is known to be ac, where ot= 
1/137: the fine-structure constant. Should the peripheral charge velocity 
for the electron ring be bigger or smaller? Since the Compton wavelength 
ti/mc was mentioned a long time ago as a possible candidate for r, let us 
see where that goes if we evaluate cor for r=ti/mc. One finds, by using 
Eq. 10, 
cor = co h/mc = mc2/mc = c. 
13
Our standard training in relativity makes the result of Eq. 13 unacceptable.

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
175
Even so, there are here some good reasons for a reconsideration of this 
unorthodox result.
To bring this point in focus, it will be necessary to argue for the domain 
of the particle itself the existence of different kinematic rules for mass and 
charge. Mass is subject to the speed-of-light restriction of relativity. For 
charge "riding" on mass, the same restriction must apply. However, this 
conclusion no longer is valid for a particle’s interior.
Charge is a primary concept and mass is a derived, secondary concept, 
because mass relates to, and follows from, the energy configuration of the 
fields associated with charge. This distinction acquires a fundamental im­
portance when seen in the perspective of the metric-free (z.e., no speed-of- 
light restriction) versus the metric-based aspects of electrodynamics.
It has remained a rather well-preserved secret that there exists a pre­
metric form of electrodynamics. It was discovered shortly after the emer­
gence of the general theory of relativity by Kottler and Cartan. Later the 
subject was much further developed by van Dantzig and the Dutch school 
of Schouten. While the special- and the general theory of relativity are 
both inextricably related to the existence of a spacetime metric field, pre­
metric electrodynamics, by contrast, is metric-independent.
One wonders first what kind of physics could possibly relate to a met­
ric-free spacetime; is not all physics inextricably tied up with metric con­
cepts? The answer is that much, but not all, physics is inseparable from the 
metric. Many counting procedures of identical physical objects should, in 
principle, be free of metric considerations. There are many situations in 
which charge, flux and angular momentum states are, in principle, 
countable multiples of universal quantum units: e.g., e, h/e, and h. Pre­
metric spacetime, therefore, is a natural backdrop for the description of 
fundamental quantum phenomena. 2 Such counting with the help of period 
integrals is essentially a topological process (chapter VI).
Since the metric-free counting procedures referred to here 
are topological in nature, pre-metric general spacetime invari­
ance is to be regarded as a sine qua non for topological imple­
mentation. When, in the early Twenties, the first discoveries were made 
about the metric-free invariance aspects of electrodynamics, the general 
theory of relativity was still fighting for a measure of experimental accep­
tance. Mindful of the mathematical complexity of the general theory, in 
which the metric held a most essential role, there was at that time little in­
clination to consider further metric-independent mathematical subtleties, 
which, at the time, had no immediate bearing on physical reality.
A descriptive account of this situation was given by Whittaker^ some 
three decades later. His description clearly depicts the sentiment of that 
time, which still prevails today if one reads the commentaries on Einstein's 

CHAPTER XI
176
principle of (metric-dependent) general covariance in the contemporary 
textbook literature on the general theory of relativity.
Yet Whittaker's account reaches a near prophetic level when he empha­
sizes the importance of global-type integral formulations in physics over 
the prevailing local methods based on solving differential equations. The 
frequently mentioned, but rarely incisively discussed, incompatibility 
between relativity and quantum mechanics can hardly be resolved without 
a balanced discussion of local and global methods in physics. By recalling 
these past contributions we aim at restoring in this manner a measure of 
balance between classical and nonclassical epithets.
5. Magnetic Forces as PoincarS Stresses
In the preceding historic perspective on the classical electron, Poincare 
stresses were mentioned as the postulated agent preventing the Lorentz 
electron from blowing apart. When hardly a quarter of a century later, the 
electron was found to have magnetic properties, the then prevailing consen­
sus showed little inclination to consider whether those added magnetic 
properties might yield a substantiation for the physical reality of the 
Poincare stresses. A situation is discussed in this section, which indicates 
how electrostatic and magnetostatic forces can approach a balance.
The essence of the idea can be demonstrated with the help of two paral­
lel electron beams; the electrostatic forces between the beams cause a re­
pulsion and the magnetic forces generated by the beam currents are coun­
teracting with an opposing attraction. The cited effect can be expected to 
play a role in the focusing designs for electron-beam devices. In the pre­
sent context, the condition of balance between these forces is a point of ma­
jor concern.
Consider a section of length L for the two parallel beams at distance r 
with I » r. Let q be the charge per unit length, and let the charge move at 
the velocity v. The electric field E at a distance r becomes, according to 
Gauss' theorem, q/2TT€or and the repelling Coulomb force Fc on the 
charge Lq of the neighbor beam section becomes
Fc = L(q)2/2-jT€0r . 
14
The magnetic field H generated by the beam current J = qv at the 
position of the neighbor beam at distance r is, according to Stokes' law 
qv/2Kr. The corresponding magnetic induction B = p0H. The mutual 
magnetic force Fm according to Ampere's law becomes L J B or
Fm = Pol(qv)2/27rr . 
15

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
177
Equating the Fc of Eq.14 and the Fm of Eq.15 yields the not altogether 
surprising result
v2 = (€0M0)-1, 
16
indicating that the balance between Coulomb and Ampere forces can only 
occur if v approaches the speed of light c.
The traditional relativity conscience is inclined to militate against the 
unorthodox result of Eq. 16. How can charge reach the speed of light, 
without causing divergencies of the kind: Lim. 1 /[1-(v/c)2] 
for v-»c ?
Let it be said that in many applications, v comes very close to the speed of 
light. In such applications pertaining to particle behavior, mass is the 
inseparable companion of charge by virtue of the energy associated with 
any charge configuration. Yet when we consider the mechanism of 
electromagnetic mass formation in the particle itself, it is unavoidable to 
consider differences in charge and mass kinematics.
In reconciling these matters, it is necessary to consider the metric 
differences between mass and charge. Charge is a metric-independent 
quantity not subject to the limitations of relativity. In premetric 
electrodynamics, there is no basis, nor reason, to limit charge to sublight 
velocities. Mass, on the other hand, is a typically metric-based concept and 
is, by virtue of this fact, subject to metric restriction. It takes time before 
the different perspectives, brought about by premetric aspects, acquire a 
fair measure of maturity and acceptability in our thinking.
6. What Is A Slender Ring?
In the course of these discussions, a ring structure has been casually 
mentioned as accounting for the electron's observable magnetic moment. 
In an even more casual manner, the ring was taken to be a slender ring. 
Let us now test whether this assumption is reasonable by making a 
calculational estimate.
Consider hereto a "slender" ring of "effective" azimuthal dimension R 
and of "effective" meridional dimension r with r « R. Let the elementary 
charge e be circulating on the ring periphery in an azimuthal direction with 
the velocity v. The ring current is then
J = ev/2iTR . 
17
Now let the effective r be so defined that it determines an effective H in 
the ring interior with the help of the Ampere formula, because most of the 
flux is close to the tube radius r
H = J/2jTr . 
18

178
CHAPTER XI
The flux through the ring may then be evaluated as
<D = 7t R2 go H. 
19
Assuming the ground state of flux <t> = h/e, one finds from Eqs. 17,18 and 
19 the remarkable relation
(v/c) = (217/a) (R/r) , 
20
where a is the fine structure constant defined by the impedance ratio
a = 
/ (Zh/e2). 
21
If, as argued in the previous section, we make the extrapolation v-*c , the 
ratio of meridional and azimuthal radii becomes
r/R = a/2rr = 0.00116.... , 
22
which is very slender indeed.
7. Trefoil and Multi-foil as Lepton Models
The trefoil has been explored in chapter VIII as a potential model for 
the electron. The preliminary results showed a possibility of accounting for 
a positive correction 1 + ar/2iT of the anomaly of the magnetic moment. 
The measured value of the electron moment anomaly is slightly less. The 
measured muon anomaly, on the other hand, is slightly more than that 
calculated value ac/Zn. Let us explore the chances of accounting for these 
higher order corrections with the help of a trefoil-type model.
Thus far the experimentation with formula in the preceding sections has 
shown how classical expressions retain a measure of relevance, even in 
domains for which our thinking has been conditioned not to expect their 
applicability. The Dirac electron so identified itself as an almost purely 
magnetic structure. It is then natural to restore at least some of Lorentz' 
electrostatic energy. If this is to be done, it should be done in a manner to 
secure a balance between electrostatic and magnetic forces. The first step to 
this effect is a generalization of Eq. 12 by adding the electrostatic energy 
eV:
me2 = <&J + eV , 
23
in which V is taken to be a surface potential of the ring and e is again the 
elementary charge.
The next assignment is finding a ring model that can account for a 
conceivable equilibrium between electric and magnetic stresses; a tubular 
ring already has a built-in feature to this effect. Yet, the ring has a 
disturbing center of symmetry. The existence of such a center must be 
regarded as incompatible with the principle of electron-positron pairing, 
because parity transformations (spatial inversion) are supposed to change 
electrons into positrons and vice versa.
The remaining option now is to physically endow the tubular ring 
surface with a property that its charge changes sign under inversion. This

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
179
assumption is, however, not adequate to account for the so-called "local" 
half spin properties of the electron. A possible solution compatible with 
the electron's half-spin is a knotted double ring, which, in the mathematical 
literature, is known as a trefoil. In the context of particle theory, the 
trefoil has been introduced, in a related yet somewhat different manner, by 
the late Herbert Jehle.4
Since the trefoil has an azimuthal winding number 2 and a meridional 
winding number 3, the current J through the trefoil tube encircles twice the 
central hole and goes around three times in the meridional direction. The 
current J thus links the ring periphery three times and must be expected to 
generate a small closed flux ring Or, which was neglected in the 
calculations of chapter VII. Since this flux closes on itself, it has no 
outward magnetic moment manifestation; it consequently subtracts from 
the principal flux component Op going through the hole of the trefoil. The 
two flux components together add up to the fundamental flux unit linked by 
the Aharonov-Bohm integral.
Once topological features can be admitted as an element of particle 
structure, there are several options of accounting for anomalies with 
respect to the model-independent Dirac process of magnetic moment 
evaluation. Here is a survey of some possibilities that conceivably could 
have a wider bearing on reality if the trefoil model is extended into a 
"multi-foil" model.
Let J be the current in the single multi-foil tube circulating n times 
azimuthally and k times meridionally. The number pair (n;k) are the 
"multi-foil" winding numbers. Let Op be the external flux component 
generated by the current J of this trefoil-like configuration manifesting a 
magnetic moment p. Let Or be the flux component that closes on itself 
encircled by the meridional windings of the multi-foil knot. Ignoring the 
small electro-flux component and assuming a total flux ground state h/e, 
the flux quantization laws would give:
Op + Or = h/e 
24
Taking into account the multi-foil winding numbers (n;k), the energy 
balance assumes the form
me2 = Op nJ + Or kJ + eV, 
25
in which (as before) the left-hand side represents the particle mass energy 
and the last term on the right-hand side represents the electrostatic energy 
associated with the multi-foil surface. Solving for J, one obtains:
mc2-eV
J = —,

n Op + k Of
or writing in accordance with the condition of Eq.24 and x<l

180
CHAPTER XI
C>r=xh/e and <DP =(1-x)h/e 
27
Eq. 26 becomes
e(mc2-eV)
J = h[n + (k-n)x] 
28
For n azimuthal windings nJ is now the current that generates the 
externally observable magnetic moment ji. Eliminating the geometric 
references from the magnetic moment formula, as done earlier in chapter 
VIII, Eq.4, gives the expression e2c2/4iTJ in which J is the total 
circulating current. This expression should now be corrected for the 
azimuthal flux leakage by the factor (1-x). Hence replacing J by nJ and in­
serting the flux reduction factor (1-x), the magnetic moment is now 
e2c2(l-x)
Substitution Eq.28 for J gives as magnetic moment for the multi-foil of 
winding numbers (n;k) the expression:
e2c2(1-x) [n + (k-n)x]h
= 4iTn e(mc2-eV)
or
e_ h (1-x)[1-(1-k/n)x]
= m 2 1-eV/mc2
30
which immediately assumes a familiar form for the electron, when 
eV/mc2=Qr/2rr«l and also x«l. Taking into account these inequalities, 
the multi-foil magnetic moment for the general winding numbers n and k 
becomes
eh.

Note how the anomaly term with x changes sign if, instead of the winding 
numbers (2;3), the numbers (2;5), or (2;7) are chosen.
Let us stop short of declaring that the cited change of sign distinguishes 
the muon from the electron. Other things are needed for continuing along 
those lines. For one, it is necessary to make a more convincing evaluation 
of the number x then presently suggested by Eq.22. At this point, let it 
suffice to say that the flux ratio <>r/C>p would have to be of the order 
(r/R)2, which, according to Eq.22, makes C>r/C>p indeed a higher order 
anomaly of the order o<2, which is at least of the order of magnitude as 
experimentally observed.
A quick comparison with experimental electron and muon data^ in 
comparison with their common electrostatic anomaly component (1 + a/Zrr) 

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
181
shows a negative correction for the electron and a positive correction for 
the muon
1 + <5e 
= 1.001159652; - correction 0.000001757
1 + or/2tt = 1.001161409 ; common term for electron and muon
1 + <5p 
= 1.001165924; + correction 0.000004515
Since the electrostatic correction is positive, and the flux leakage 
correction is negative, the muon might be thought of as having a relatively 
higher electrostatic energy. The latter fact could contribute to its inherent 
instability, if the condition for impedance matching can no longer be 
accurately met.
Another option of accounting for the change of sign of the higher-order 
anomaly correction is revealed through Eq.31 by assuming electron and 
muon have different winding numbers. As indicated in the next section, an 
azimuthal winding number n=2 seems dictated by the half-integral spin 
property electron and muon have in common. This still leaves an option of 
different meridional winding numbers k. The number pair (2;3) yields 
according to Eq.31, a negative correction -x/2. The number pairs (2;5) and 
(2;7), say, as conceivable muon candidates, give +x/2 and +3x/2. 
According to the just cited experimental data the observed ratio of higher 
order muon versus electron corrections is of the order 4515/1757=12,571. 
For comparison, the ratio associated with the number pairs (2;7) and (2;3) 
gives 131. All this remains a crude form of experimentation, because Eq.24 
still ignores a conveivable electro-flux contribution; the latter is, so far, 
only accounted for in the energy balance.
By the same token, the adventure of open experimentation with particle 
models also invites reexamining the completeness of the flux balance of 
Eq.24. Taking into account the electro-flux we have:
h/e= Op + Vdt = d>p + d>r - V/i>; the period T = 1/-v. 
24a
Since Op is the component generating the magnetic moment p, Eqs.2 or 4 
of chapter VIII might be replaced by the nonmetric relation:
e2
4iTm • 
32
Solving Eq.24a for Op and substitution in Eq.32 yields 
e h r V/v q>K i
2 L1 + h/e h/eJ ’ 
33
Independent of the energy balance Eq.25, the flux balance Eq.33 seems to 
yield all the essential anomaly features. The first term in the bracket gives 
the Dirac part, followed by the Schwinger term and the higher-order 
correction for flux leakage. Since (V/v)/(h/e) = eV/mc2, there is a 
measure of, yet no full, compatibility between energy and flux balances.

182
CHAPTER XI
These are just samples of model-based explorations into some 
conceivable structural features of nature's fundamental building blocks. 
Looking at these efforts in the perspective of the very abstract QED 
approach which avoids making explicit models, one cannot deny the latter's 
inner wisdom of steering clear from the potential pitfalls invited by model 
making. Yet, also QED is not altogether model-free. The point-particle 
emerges in QED as a model of sorts, which (see section 9) requires rather 
more unusual properties to account for the world we observe. Perhaps a 
measure of more realistic model-making should be kept alive, provided we 
remain aware of distinctions between model and reality.
The upshot of this theoretical exeprimentation indicates that a cautiously 
extended model-making can help by complementing the very abstract QED 
approaches. It injects new adventure, where earlier only a dead-end-street 
could be envisioned. The new adventure yields numerous questions worthy 
of further consideration, e.g., why can bound muons, neutrons, and pions 
become stable? Could the muon still have a pivotal role for the structure of 
protons and neutrons, now believed to be compound structures of quarks 
and gluons?
8. The Enigma of Half-Integer Spin
Finally let us reexamine the question whether or not the electron model 
can account for the half integer properties h/2 of electron spin. It is this 
property that has marked a major milestone in the almost exclusive accep­
tance of the contemporary abstract methods of physics. The subtle connec­
tion between spinors and the two-valuedness of the group spaces of rotation 
and Lorentz groups has given iron-clad justifications for the prevailing ab­
stract approaches. Arguments favoring abstractness still prevail today on 
the instructional level. While two-valuedness is now much better under­
stood from a mathematical^ angle, so far, contemporary physics has not in­
corporated these mathematical improvements.
Abstract "spinorization" is a global mathematical concept intimately 
related to the much more visualizable notion of nontrivial mirror 
symmetry. Two objects are said to be nontrivially mirror symmetric if 
they can't be identified by continuous deformations.
The crystallographers discovered this phenomenon in crystal morphol­
ogy for the rotation subgroups. They gave it the name "enantiomorphism." 
Spinorization, in the physical sense, must be regarded as an expression of 
spatial and spacetime enantiomorphism for particles in the microphysical 
domain. Mathematically, the global nature of spinorial pairing becomes an 
explicit pair feature if the objects so adjoined are imbedded in an orientable 
space or spacetime. Physically it means that an electron can't come back as 
a positron by carrying it around a cyclic path.

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
183
The mathematical methods of physics at the time of the emerging 
abstract procedures culminated, quite exclusively, in the use of differential 
equations, which are tools that are strictly local in nature. Yet, space and 
spacetime enantiomorphism (or spinorization, if you will) are undeniably 
global ingredients, even in the microphysical building blocks of nature. It 
seems reasonable to expect that these global characteristics leave a nonlocal 
trace in the differential equation approach. Dirac first picked up this thread 
of global conscience by injecting his spinors in local description.
After this lengthy introduction on the delineation of local and global 
procedures, the identification of half-integer quantum numbers now ap­
pears anticlimactic. It is no coincidence that Dirac is the father of the action 
unit b = h/2n'. The ti simplifies matters for local differential descriptions.
Planck's original action quantum h, by contrast, prevails in the global 
integral conditions of the earlier forms of quantum mechanics practiced by 
Planck, Bohr and Sommerfeld. The factor 2jc is then readily identified as 
the result of a single-loop integration. Planck's h is the globally secured 
quantum of action; the ft appears as local counterpart in a 2k single loop 
integration, if, and only if, orbital momentum is also locally conserved. 
The half- integer unit b/2 appears as a locally conserved counterpart of a 
globally conserved h that is obtained in a double-loop integration of 4k, 
such as is required by the trefoil. Dirac theory produces both the b and 
b/2 by locally reestablishing a conscience for global requirements.
9. Zitterbewegung and Trefoil Model
At center-stage, we consider here a famous paper by van Dyck, 
Schwinberg and DehmeltJ This publication established milestones, not 
only in terms of precision in measuring the electron’s gyromagnetic ratio, 
it also claims these measurements to be the result of observations on single 
electrons, isolated and nearly at rest in Penning traps.
In presenting their results the authors delineate their views in a 
theoretical perspective that in part goes back to Schroedinger, Dirac, Pauli, 
Huang, and Schwinger. The Dirac theory of the electron plays a role, 
because it locally associates the velocity of light with the electron. 
Schroedinger is involved for the famous concept of the Zitterbewegung, 
which is, in essence, an expression of a universal zero-point disturbance by 
viewing an isolated single free electron as subject to Heisenberg 
uncertainty. Pauli is involved for general pronouncements concerning 
electron modelling and limits of experimental observability. Huang is 
instrumental in these discussions for his reexamination of Schroedinger's 
concept of Zitterbewegung. Schwinger is involved for his QED work that 
led to the precision calculations of the electron's anomalous moment

184
CHAPTER XI
HuangS has reexamined Schroedinger's Zitterbewegung for the Dirac 
electron. This reexamination sheds an interesting light on contemporary 
thinking in physics. For the purpose of this discussion, the following 
statement, taken from the abstract, is cited, because these views, expressed 
in the Fifties, still hold a central position more than thirty years later for 
the discussions in ref.7, which go back to the Eighties:
’’The well-known Zitterbewegung may be looked upon as a 
circular motion about the direction of the electron spin with 
radius equal to the Compton wavelength* (1/2tt) of the electron. 
The intrinsic spin of the electron may be looked upon as the 
orbital angular momentum of this motion. The current produced 
by the Zitterbewegung is seen to give rise to the intrinsic 
magnetic moment of the electron.” 
HuangS
In the last paragraphs of his article, Huang points out familiar 
shortcomings of classical electron models, which give either a correct 
magnetic moment or a correct spin, but not both. He mentions that he 
cross-checked his results with leading authorities in the field of quantum 
mechanics and QED, which, in a sense, qualifies his conclusions as a third- 
generation Schroedinger result.
Now returning to ref. 7, let us quote here how van Dyck, Schwinberg 
and Dehmelt summarize the electron picture they associate with their 
Penning trap experiment:
” ..... What remains is a soft quasi-orbital structure of radius
about one Compton wavelength* (1 / 2 rr) formed by the circular 
Zitterbewegung of the hard ’’point” electron of dimension 
smaller than 10'16 cm. It is this structure on which measure­
ments of the intrinsic magnetism of the electron provide infor­
mation. While the above constitutes a certain justification of 
Pauli's initial rejection of the spinning electron model as Neue 
Irrelehre, Pauli, on the other hand, overshot the mark when he 
attempted to prove that spin and magnetism of the free electron 
could not be measured by a suitable variant of the Stern-Gerlach 
experiment.” 
Dehmelt^ et al
By surreptitiously removing a nonclassical statistics from their model, 
Huang, Dehmelt, et al, silently opened a way to becoming even more 
explicit about further pursuing a classical vein of argument.
The Trefoil Electron Model
Pauli the originator of the neutrino, the exclusion principle, and many 
other contributions to modem physics, not only went too far in rejecting 
free electron measurements, he also went too far in rejecting the spinning 
electron model. It can hardly be denied that the quasi-orbital model pic­
tured by van Dyck, Schwinberg, and Dehmelt comes amazingly close to a 

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
185
classical model of a ring current. The words "soft quasi-orbital" are clearly 
injected to cover a retraction from the taken position and to make apparent 
that the model is not to be taken too literally in a classical manner.
What prevents a model development in an even more classical vein? 
Huang indicates how this difficulty relates to meeting simultaneously 
physical reality for spin and magnetic moment both. A factor 2 keeps 
haunting these models; either the magnetic moment is off or the spin is off.
If the Huang^-Dehmelt^ et al model of the electron has already a close 
resemblance to a classical model, the here presented trefoil model may well 
be classified as classical all the way. Why does the here chosen model 
manage to reconcile spin and magnetic moment calculations simultaneously, 
whereas earlier classical models have only been able to meet either one or 
the other, but not both?
An inspection of the previous section permits the identification of two 
crucial distinctions that make this reconciliation possible. They are: 
I. Jehle's4 trefoil model, which is here applied to the electron, in 
conjunction with: II. Kiehn's definition of field angular momentum as a 
three-dimensional period integral permitting an orbital as well as a spin 
adaptation (see chapter VI).
The Dehmelt et al experimentation shows that those adhering to Pauli's 
nonclassical radicalism about measurability, may have to swallow some of 
their pronouncements. Yet combining the Jehle-Kiehn propositions 
(i.e. applying spin integral to trefoil) reveals a need for even greater tol­
erance than Dehmelt et al were willing to accept for a classical model. 
The trefoil is in the category that Pauli might have denounced as neue 
Irrelehre. (new misleading teachings).
Last, but not least, an inquiry from QED circles must be expected 
whether the trefoil model can offer also perspectives for obtaining higher 
order anomaly terms that presently permit a detailed distinction between 
electron and muon properties. Let us recall that the first higher order 
QED calculations showed discrepancies that were resolved later. The tre­
foil model should be given equal consideration to prove itself. The 
following statement deleneates the present situation; it casts a frightening 
harsh light on the conceptualizations that have been permitted in physics 
for more than three decades:
The fact that Huang, Dehmelt et al need to take recourse to 
transforming the "Zitterbewegung's (nonclassical) statistical 
disorder" into the "perfect (classical) order" of a point-charge 
in circular orbit is, for all practical purposes, a resounding ex­
perimental rejection of Copenhagen’s a priori single-system 
uncertainty and zero-point disturbance. Over and above, this 
QED inspired model of a point-charge in circular orbit does not

compare well with the trefoil model from a point of view of 
providing model-based calculational potential.
10. Conclusion
The presented excursion in the land of abstract modem physics, with the 
help of a vehicle that is widely believed to be unsuitable for such 
endeavors, is bound to raise eyebrows. The mere simplicity of some of the 
procedures raises suspicion, because we have been psychologically 
conditioned to suspect intrusions of classical methods in the nonclassical 
realm. The end product can be taken as a mnemonic device to make a 
difficult matter more transparent or, a reminder to seek new options. 
Sometimes both paths, if used in a complementary fashion, can give a 
perspective for synthesis.
In the process of pursuing the latter course of action, the interface of 
conceptual confrontation can present us already with some pointers about 
different angles of assessing the classical and nonclassical realms. First of 
all, we need to realize that the classical/nonclassical distinction is a very 
subjective notion which has been far too much emphasized for purposes of 
instruction. Contemporary teaching of physics prematurely abandons 
visualization, in fact, visualization has, at times, been portrayed as an 
obstacle on the path of understanding modem physics.
For comparison, let us also assess some conceivable shortcomings at the 
classical end. Classical and semiclassical physics have retained an undue 
emphasis on the methods of analytic descriptions with the help of 
differential equations. Many laws, originally given by Nature in some sort 
of integral form, have been religiously converted into a local form, 
permitting the use of differential equations. The Maxwell equations are an 
example. Whenever the phrase "Maxwell equations" is mentioned, people 
think of a set of differential equations, not the integral global counterparts 
from which they derive. Yet, the latter relate directly to the experiments 
that initiated Maxwell theory.
Mathematically, a restoration of a global point of view in physics is 
bound to inject greater awareness for matters pertaining to topology. The 
principle of single system quantum uncertainty has unfortunately prevented 
a topological view of microphysics from coming to fruition. The 
immersion of physical objects into a sea of an, always present, a priori 
quantum uncertainty does not invite topological inquiry. Traditional views 
of quantum uncertainty affecting isolated particles, as if bouncing around 
on an "infinite" zero-point energy of vacuum are in dire need of revision.
In the spirit of an interpretation in the sense of Einstein and Popper, 
quantum mechanical uncertainty becomes a manifestation of real physical 
ensembles. Here the additional requirement is stipulated that the ensemble 
needs to be randomized in mutual phase and mutual orientation of the 

CLASSICAL NONCLASSICAL ASYMPTOTICS
187
ensemble constituents. For many years, Planck's zero-point energy tico/2 
and the calculations of Feynman and Kompaneyetsthe of the quantum 
number \/n(n +1) of chapter III; 5 have, for many years, been silent 
testimony to a classical statistics underlying modem quantum mechanics. 
With all those classical alternatives hitting us in the face, it is hard to 
conceive how the nonclassical myth ever got off the ground. It seemed that, 
at the time, the world of physics had a need for mystery and magic.

AN ATTEMPT AT COHOMOLOGICAL SYNTHESIS

CHAPTER XII
ARROWED TIME AND CYCLIC TIME
1. 
Topological Torsion
In the preceding chapters, cyclic integrals in the time domain have been 
used for periodic systems. The justification for this course of action was 
somewhat glibly based on the conclusion that the consecutive periods of a 
purely periodic system are truly indistinguishable. At the end of a period, 
the system is exactly in the same state as at the beginning of the period, so, 
for all practical purposes, it looks like a closed time loop. In addition to 
this strictly formal argument, there was, in retrospect, a justification with 
which it is difficult to argue, because the results so obtained made sense. 
For the quantum Hall, the Josephson a.c. and other effects, the 
identification of time periodicity as a cyclic feature leads to experimentally 
verifiable results. Furthermore, discussing the relation between Aharonov- 
Bohm and Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals, a cyclic time integral is found to 
relate to cyclic spatial integrals (chapter VI, section 2, Eq.7).
Yet, even if many physical laws happen to be invariant under time 
reversal, the truth is that other physical laws (e.g., the entropy law) give us 
an arrow of time. It is this unilateral property of the time coordinate, as 
contrasted with the bilateral properties of spatial coordinates, that has 
remained a shadow standing in the way of a wholehearted acceptance of 
Minkowski's spacetime as a true four-dimesional arena of physical reality. 
Somehow and sometimes, physics and physicists feel they has been carried 
away by Minkowski's famous and eloquent Cologne address, in which he 
pulled off an epistemological masterpiece by claiming that "the difference 
between space and time would sink away into a mere shadow."
Then, when physics had a chance of collecting its wits after the mind 
boggling Minkowski-Einstein avalanche of spacetime physics, pragmatists 
had second thoughts about the matter. Some said, wait a moment, what was 
that again? There is no difference between space and time? You can't sell 
me that, I can't accept it! Of course, the pragmatist is right; yet, by the 
same token, Minkowski was right. A resolution of this apparent 
controversy is in Minkowski's own words. He never said there would be no 
difference; he said "the difference would sink away into a mere shadow."
189

190
CHAPTER XII
This chapter aims at getting to know more about Minkowski's shadow 
hanging between space and time.
The presented predicament can also be looked at from a more purely 
mathematical angle. The identification of algebraic counterparts of geo­
metric as well as topological features has opened a door to an abstract as­
sessment of higher dimensional configurations, the ensuing disciplines of 
algebraic geometry and algebraic topology testify to this. Here for a 
change, it was the escape in abstraction that reshaped perception. At first, 
the conceptual step from three- to higher-dimensional spaces does not 
invoke essential differences in the nature of added dimensions. The pseudo­
visualization so obtained is traditionally geometry-inspired. The added 
dimensions are thought of as having geometric connotations.
An opportunity occurs for making dimensional distinctions that retain 
an invariant quality, when the multidimensional configuration is taken to 
be a metric space. The invariance of the signature of the metric under real 
transformation adds such an invariant feature. The Minkowski signature 
{+,+,+,-} testifies to an undeniable distinction between time- and spatial 
coordinates. All of which goes to show that those who unduly favor the 
substitution u=ctV-T in transforming the indefinite metric x2+y2+z2-c2t2 
into a positive definite metric x2+y2+z2+u2 can be blamed for wiping out a 
space-time distinction given to us by Nature.
After having thus established that the metric is an active reminder of 
space-time distinctions, the question arises as to what happens in premetric 
situations. In the previous chapters, the period integrals were, after all, 
hailed for their metric-independent qualities, permitting an extension of 
their applicability from macro- to micro domains. While metric­
independent does not imply there is no metric, the question remains: if we 
can't call on a metric, how do we keep track of space-time distinction?
The answer suggests a potential topological criterion for space-time 
distinction. The concept of topological torsion can be assigned to assume 
this role of providing a premetric distinction between space and time 
dimensions. Let us briefly summarize here the principal points of algebraic 
topology that have led to the concept of topological torsion.
When, towards the end of the last century Poincare and others extended 
the so-called "Betti groups" to multidimensional configurations, the 
question arose whether these additive groups should also include in their 
basis of generators cyclic (torsion) elements. Since the Betti (Homology) 
groups belong to the category of finitely generated additive groups, there 
was no obvious reason to exclude these torsion elements. The ensuing 
purely algebraic extensions to the notion of manifold topology were 
accepted, in the hope that future developments would identify a more ex­
plicit role for Poincare's new concept of torsion.

ARROWED TIME AND CYCLIC TIME
191
Subsequent efforts to come up with geometric illustrations of torsion led 
to the Projective Plane and the Klein Bottle. Both examples stretch the 
ability at visualization, because they can only be imbedded in four 
dimensions. Alexandroff and Hopfl then proved that torsion cannot really 
occur in less than four dimensions; in fact in four dimensions it is only 
possible to have one dimensional torsion. In five dimensions, the torsion 
dimensions can be 1 and 2 dimensional and in general for dimension n>3, 
they run from 1 to n-3. In other words, only four dimensions can 
accommodate a unique case of one-dimensional torsion. It is now tempting 
to relate the cyclic group characteristics of torsion with the uniquely cyclic 
features given to time by the purely periodic systems. This conjecture only 
flies, however, if time periodicity has an intrinsic feature, which 
distinguishes it from spatial periodicity as displayed in crystals. Let us note 
that the spatial lattice periodicity requires an object repetition in each 
lattice point; the time periodicity, by contrast, acquires a unique fourth 
dimension character, because it is generated by one and the same object.
This at first surprising restriction on the possibilities of torsion 
structure in manifolds is geometrically not an easily visualizable matter. 
Perhaps it becomes more acceptable, if we realize that there are other 
typical topological features that are contingent on manifold dimension. 
Linking is a familiar and visual example; it is not possible in two 
dimensions. Linking becomes a realistic possibility from three dimensions 
upward.______________________________________________________
Similarly, one-dimensional torsion becomes a realistic possibility in 
four dimensions. It is the here-cited property of topological torsion that 
will accommodate both the cyclic as well as the unilateral nature of time.
2. 
Physical Examples of Torsion
Let us now see whether elementary particle processes can give a 
reasonably fundamental illustration of how time differs from spatial 
coordinates. Consider hereto the cloud-chamber pictures of some familiar 
elementary particle processes. The trajectories of electrically charged 
particles become visible by their condensation tracks, and the trajectories 
of the neutral particles, such as neutrino and photon, are inferred on the 
basis of known conservation laws. The completed world-line trajectories of 
these elementary particle events have become known as Feynman diagrams.
The general picture so obtained is a spatial network of world-lines, each 
provided with an arrow of time. These world-lines represent stable, or 
almost stable, particles. They originate (creation) in nodal points of world­
line intersection, with the arrow of time pointing away from the nodal 
point. They terminate (i.e., physically annihilate) where the arrow of time 
on the world-line points towards the nodal point.

192
CHAPTER XII
The nodal points are event centers where particles are transformed 
into other particles. These events can come about spontaneously (e.g., as in 
the weak interaction of (3-decay); other interactions (e.g., electro-magnetic, 
and strong interaction) are contingent on outside influences such as particle 
collisions.
How do these diagrams of elementary particle processes relate to a 
corresponding spacetime language reflecting the topological overtones 
alluded to in the cohomology of forms and the associated homology of 
their domains of integration? The world-lines of the diagrams may be 
taken to have a three-dimensional lateral extend. The spacetime existence 
of a particle then is characterized by a four-dimensional domain which is 
very elongated in the direction of the world-line. It is, so to say, a four­
dimensional tube or wire.
In view of the varying distances between nodal points, the length of 
these tubes or wires cannot be very critical for identifying the nature of the 
particle. Stable and semi-stable particles thus have physical characteristics 
that are largely independent of this rather coincidental worldline length. 
One therefore would expect a (periodic) section of the worldline tube to 
suffice as being fully descriptive of the particle under consideration. Away 
from a nodal point (event domain), it does not really matter where the 
section is made; any section on the replicating worldline tube will do.
We now have a particle picture that says we should expect a periodicity 
in the direction of the worldline that is characteristic of the particle in 
question. A characteristic periodic time interval T on the worldline tube 
is indeed given by the familiar relation T=h/mc2 , where m is the particle 
mass and h is Planck's constant of action The period of a photon hardly 
needs commentary. Yet the neutrino period may need more thought.
The overall picture of the worldline tubes representing particles is now 
that of different types of periodic, beaded strings. The periodicity of the 
beads simulates, so to say, the self-replicating nature of the particle in the 
course of time._________________________________________________
A one-dimensional torsion cycle can now be identified as characterizing 
a particle's cyclic time. This cyclic time functions as a measuring tape 
intertwined with the direction of the arrowed time on the particle's 
worldline._____________________________________________________
The torsion number counts the number of cyclic elements on a given 
worldline, and so becomes a measure for particle lifetime in terms of its 
own characteristic period. The torsion numbers for stable and semi-stable 
particles are, of course, enormous. For the life time c of a muon say, the 
ratio r/T is of the order 5.6 1016, and, in general, near-limitless for an 
electron.

ARROWED TIME AND CYCLIC TIME
193
Worldlines originate and terminate in four-dimensional event domains 
of transitional action. The latter have no obvious periodicity properties. 
All that is known about interaction events is that they take a small interval 
of time and a small spatial domain to come about. They are spacetime 
domains topologically equivalent to a four-dimensional ball.
Seen from a particle point of view, the process of physical evolution 
thus resembles a neuron net of event domains interconnected by world-line 
tubes with arrows of time and beaded in a near-infinitely fine manner.
3. 
Period Integral Assessment of Feynman Diagrams
To make sure that a period integral cleanly links or encloses an object, 
say an obstruction, it is necessary that its integration cycles reside 
everywhere in a region where the exterior derivative of the integrated 
form vanishes. The Gauss integral always serves as a useful reminder of 
this fact; the surface of integration resides where the divergence (i.e., 
exterior derivative) of the integrand is zero. The surface is, so to say, not 
allowed to go through a charge. Electric charges are either inside or or 
outside the surface enclosure.
The just-depicted situation differs slightly from what is usually 
envisioned from the point of view of a geometry-based mathematical in­
terpretation. In that case, the integration cycle is thought of as enclosing a 
hole. Since there is nothing assumed to be in the hole, for a geometric 
substratum, the idea of only enclosing part of a hole is here not given any 
relevance. The integration cycle takes everything or nothing, because it 
cannot be anywhere else! The discreteness of elementary charge imposes a 
similar alternative, provided the indivisibility of elementary charge stands 
firm. So far, experiment confirms the indivisibility of electric charge.
The physics-based interpretation of period integrals yields an additional 
bonus of evaluation opportunities if the hole is physically alive; meaning it 
is not a void as in the geometry-based interpretation. An application of 
Stokes theorem now permits an evaluation of the period integral by 
integrating over the content of the hole. In physics, it can happen that the 
content of the hole is more accessible than the field surrounding the hole. 
By having the hole interior a void, the geometry-based interpretation 
bereaves itself of this option, because the differential form is not defined 
in the void.
The task now before us is one of designing an operational process that 
takes full advantage of the complementary duality of the cohomology of 
period integrals and the homology of their integration cycles. The stated 
physical purpose is an evaluation of period integrals governing the 
worldlines or, rather, one cycle thereof. Then, last but not least, central to 
the dynamics of the here considered physical topology is the question; is 

194
CHAPTER XII
there a period integral characterization of what happens in the nodal event 
of transition of the Feynman diagrams?
Following a study by Kiehn^ on the onset of instability in fluid 
dynamics, the Pfaffian integrability classes of a one-form, say, A, are taken 
to be indicative for the transition. Relevant to these considerations is the 
analogue of a Pfaffian integral of the type
|^|R^dR = multiple of (h/e)2 , 
1
which, on the basis of dimensional consideration, should be expected to 
have residue units (h/e)2. Unlike the earlier discussed period integrals, 
which characterize the structure of worldline objects, this integral can be 
shown to be capable only of giving an event description. Here is an 
example of topological dynamics, in contrast to traditional static topology.
We should not invoke, at this point, details of individual particle 
structure, because the vanishing of this integral Eq.l for particle-like 
spacetime domains would have to be something that all stable or semi-stable 
particles have in common. Such a structure-independent criterion is 
instrumental in emphasizing its exclusive relation to events. This 
requirement is indeed met by noting that the worldline tube domain of a 
stable object is a cyclic integration domain c3 which is a product cycle:
c3 = c,xc2. 
2
The Pfaffian integral Eq.l can now be rewritten according to a formula 
by Kuenneth leading to die reduction:
R/SdR = | R 
dfi = 0.
Since dR is exact the integral over c2 vanishes, hence Eq.3 vanishes.
The transition domains, where world-line tubes originate and terminate, 
is a center of change where incoming particles cease to exist and new 
particles are being formed. Using Stokes law, the cyclic Pfaffian integral 
of Eq.l can be converted into a domain integral over the interior d4 of the 
boundary 3d4 . This integral, however, can be different from zero:
^Had4n"dA-nfJd4dfi"dH^hnd4E-B dVdt-0
3
4
if, and only if, dR^dR*O, which means, in d4 , the one-form R belongs to 
the lowest Pfaffian integrability class in four-dimension. The conversion 
dR^dR -» E-B*0 is the standard translation into the Maxwellian fields of 
electric field strength E and magnetic induction B; dVdt is the spacetime 
integration element. The situation represented by Eq.4 clearly indicates 
that 3d4 cannot be a product cycle

ARROWED TIME AND CYCLIC TIME
195
3d4*c1xc2 , 
5
because the argument presented for Eq.3 holds, regardless of the Pfaffian 
integrability class of fl.
At this point, it is necessary to be aware of a difference with respect to 
standard textbook discussions. Since mathematical discussions tend to 
assume a geometry-based epistemology, the analytic continuations of A in 
the hole interior d4 are not normally considered. There is, therefore, no A 
in the hole and the Pfaffian integrability cannot come into play. In fact 
whenever the hole is taken to be empty and void, the product of an exact 
form and a closed form is deduced to be exact. Here, an earlier-mentioned 
ambiguity reoccurs: the cycle identified by a hole becomes a boundary as 
soon as the hole has an interior. For the homology classification though 
the boundary of a hole with interior is taken to be a cycle.______________
To avoid counting abstract geometric holes as physical holes with 
interior, it is essential that all topology considered is of physical origin.
Note that the (physical) interior of a "homological" hole supports forms 
that are neither closed nor exact; their exterior derivatives are nonzero 
(e.g., dfi = C#0, and dFPdfl*0). They are analytic continuations of forms 
that have vanishing exterior derivatives outside the hole.
Standard cohomology chooses to ignore those analytic continuations, 
because the geometry-restricted epistemology permits the hole to be empty 
without an analytic continuation for differential forms that are closed 
outside the hole. A physics-based epistemology is incompatible with this 
practice, because the hole is the source of the closed field outside the hole. 
Here is one of those rare cases where physics reminds mathematics not to 
oversimplify; more often mathematics acts as the conscience of physics.
4. 
The Physical "Substance” of Topological Obstructions
The "substance" of topology in geometry-oriented procedures comes 
about by definition, or, let us say, by the playful moods and imagination of 
practicing mathematicians. They can place their empty holes wherever they 
wish, say, just to make the configuration topologically interesting. In 
physics, nature determines what is interesting.
Gauss' law of electrostatics and its Ampere extension remind us again 
how electric charge somehow separates the domains where G is closed, 
dG=0, from the "hole domains" where dG#0. In the purely mathematical 
approach, the dG^O domain is replaced by a void, because electric charge 
has no place in a geometry-oriented topology.
To obtain a coherent picture of physical topological structure, the next 
question ought to focus on how the separation between dG=0 and dG^O 
domains agrees and relates to the separation of the dfl=0 versus the dfl^O 

196
CHAPTER XII
domains. This information is needed for assessing the topological role of 
the cyclic integral of the vector potential. The compatibility of the one- and 
two-connectedness of charge-current structures is a crucial viability test for 
a spacetime topological assessment of physical structures.
A refocusing of interest on this innocuous integral of the vector 
potential A has largely been due to Aharonov and Bohm. The vector 
potential A in electromagnetic theory has traditionally been treated as 
some sort of calculational expedient without an explicit and direct 
observable physical interpretation; only curlA=B had meaning as a direct 
physical observable. Aharonov and Bohm showed this traditional point of 
view to be wrong, at least in part. While A itself has no unique local 
meaning, by virtue of its being defined modulo an exact part, its cyclic 
integral has a direct physical meaning. This integral effect was verified by 
quantum interference between two electron paths linking with an adjustable 
magnetic flux ring. The interference clearly changes with the linked flux, 
although the electrons cannot locally experience the change in B, because 
their paths are nowhere close to the B#0 area.
Soon it became evident that superconductors were ideal devices for 
creating field domains where AX), yet curlA=B=0, by virtue of the 
Meissner effect. A vanishing electric field E=0 was, of course, already 
recognized as a sine qua non for superconductivity. With E=B=0, the 
superconducting state acquired a status of spacetime invariance, which is 
appropriately expressed by the invariant statement dR=F=O; this neatly 
covers London's condition of superconductivity and the Meissner effect.
At this point, it may be said that electric charge and current not only 
have a role in separating dCv=0 and ddX) domains, but simultaneously, 
they also separate dA=0 and dA^o domains. While these inferences are 
based on macroscopic situations, the metric-free nature of the associated 
integrals and their residues make it tempting to extrapolate these findings 
to the micro- and even the submicroscopic domains.
Going to the submicroscopic extreme of elementary particles with 
electric charge and nonvanishing flux, the topology of their charge-current 
distributions is given by the exact, impair 3-form C=dd. The particle is 
then, in part, describable by the period integrals delineating its 1- and 2- 
connectedness with 3-connectedness determined by their product integral.
Evidence of relevance has been presented in the earlier description of 
the electron and muon properties (chapters VI, VIII and XI). Starting with 
charge and mass, the spin and magnetic moment can be calculated, 
including the anomaly term, a/Zyr, which electron and muon have in 
common. Their mass difference still remains a shrouded secret of nature, 
yet a qualitative picture may become available in terms of their higher 
order anomaly differences.

ARROWED TIME AND CYCLIC TIME
197
The charged pion is not known to have a magnetic moment. Here the 
question is whether or not this implies a zero flux residue, or could it 
possibly imply that the magnetic flux is internal, without an external 
manifestation of magnetic moment? A topological identification of photon 
and neutrino without the 3-form C of charge presents, however, new 
questions about domain separation.
Since neither neutrino nor photon have an overt charge manifestation, 
the role of domain separation would presumably have to depend on how 
the 2-form F relates to the lightcone. This would have to lead to an 
enantiomorphic adjoint configuration for the neutrino and a self-adjoint 
configuration for the photon. It is not necessary, though, to resolve at this 
moment all matters of particle topology; the presently intended objective is 
only one of indicating the possibilities of perspectives. Let the earlier 
discussed electron-muon model suffice for the moment.
While these earlier electron-muon considerations attempt to account for 
criteria characterizing stable and semi-stable particle configurations, the 
new topological feature introduced in this chapter explicitly relates to the 
dynamics of physical topology. It is the field characterization of the event 
domain. A finite value of Eq.l as period integral would have to indicate an 
event domain, the limits of which are given by shrinking the cycle c3 until 
Eq.l begins to change its value.
An analogue of Eq.4, although not simply related to a period integral, 
is the spacetime event integral: J J J * J J J J D • H d 4x -» e2,which 
provides a measure for charge creation or annihilation in event domains.

CHAPTER XIII
QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
1. 
Introduction
A choice of strategy for an exposition of "quantum cohomology," such 
as defined and outlined in this chapter, becomes a matter of coping with 
two major hurdles standing in the way of this proposed objective. 
Quantum cohomology not only goes against major contemporary traditions 
in our attempts at understanding physics, it also demands a major 
readjustment in the prevailing geometry-based traditions of interpreting 
topological structure in mathematics. Mindful of these presently prevailing 
traditions in these two domains of science with which communication needs 
to be established, there are some real questions concerning an appropriate 
strategy of approach.
If the here-anticipated predicament of communication already requires 
walking a tightrope between two disciplines, there is, in addition, the 
marginal familiarity in physics circles with the principles algebraic 
topology. While such lack of familiarity may compound the situation, the 
lack of accompanying prejudice could be an asset. The following thus 
becomes an attempt at outlining principles of algebraic topology in the 
perspective of metaphors that still have to earn their status of relevance.
This chapter gives first a mathematically more detailed picture of the 
discussions in chapter XII. This amounts, in fact, to an outline of what can 
be suitably called a physics-based quantum cohomology. As in chapter XII, 
the customary geometry-oriented realizations of abstract topology are now 
no longer adequate in dynamic physical situations involving the time. A 
switch from a geometric to a kinematic backdrop realization is necessary.
The concept of topological torsion is of central importance in these 
developments. The difficulties encountered in visualizing torsion in three 
dimensions has long ago been identified as a contingency of the essentially 
four-dimensional connotations of torsion. In four dimensions, only one­
dimensional torsion can occur. In spacetime, one dimension can be topo­
logically distinguished from the other three dimensions by virtue of its 
option to assume torsion features. It stands to reason to test whether 
topological torsion can portray the exceptional position of the time-like 
direction of physical spacetime.

This topological time- and space-like separation of spacetime is 
compatible with, yet exists over and above and independent of, the space­
time distinction implied by the metric's signature. The topological 
invariance of the torsion distinction not only leaves intact Einstein's princi­
ple of general spacetime covariance, it, in fact, calls, by virtue of its 
topological invariance, for a metric-independent extension of said 
principle. The abstract topological feature of torsion thus can be taken to 
correspond to three-dimensional physical space without torsion and a time 
coordinate directly relating to torsion. Mindful, though, of the exclusive 
four-dimensional condition for torsion to exist, only combined space and 
time bring torsion's one-dimensional nature to an explicit and physically 
significant fruition.
The impact of torsion notions is assessed and delineated for the contem­
porary structure of physical theory. While torsion, as here envisioned, is a 
purely topological concept, an exploration implies an implementing of ho­
mology with torsion in the context of physics. Since contemporary physics 
is not exactly replete with a tightly knit structure of topological notions, an 
exploration of this kind must be combined with finding isolated instances 
where topology has already made its presence felt.
The next step is integrating these isolated instances into an encompassing 
structure, consisting of a de Rham cohomology of the differential forms of 
physics. Torsion then relates to the homology of integration cycles of the 
period integrals of those differential forms of physics. The periodicity as­
sociated with torsion permits cyclic closure in time, in the sense of weak 
homology. This picture of cyclic time periodicity is needed to define a 
period integration in time, which is compatible with time's unrelenting 
arrow of progression.
2. 
Spacetime Characterization of Physical Objects
Any physical object with which can be associated any measure of 
permanency in time can, in principle, be visualized as tracing its history in 
spacetime as a tube-like worldline configuration. This time-like elongated 
appearance is characteristic of any entity that is not subject to a change 
destroying the individuality of the object. The worldline tube gets longer 
and longer the bigger the time interval of unchanging appearance.
A constant time-slice of the worldline tube gives a bounded cross­
section in three dimensions, which is taken to be finite in size. The two­
dimensional boundary of this cross-section domain thus gives its 
momentary location and confinement in space. The interior of this two­
dimensional boundary reflects the interior structure of the object under 
consideration at the moment when the constant time-slice was taken.
For physical objects with an internal dynamic structure, such instanta­
neous identification would lead to a loss of information about the internal 

200
CHAPTER XIII
dynamics of the object. The question is how information about the inte­
rior can be retrieved by viewing the 3-dimensional object in a time ex­
tended sense?
For an object that is a compound structure, consisting of many different 
molecules, atoms and particles, such a characterization is, in principle, 
possible but would ultimately lead to a confusing compilation of time-like 
data. Every individual atom, molecule, or particle would have to be taken, 
one at a time, until a complete picture of the object is obtained. Seen from 
that angle, it seems simpler and more practical, from an information 
gathering point of view, to start with the simplest possible components of 
such objects, say, the elementary particle. In fact, this approach leads, if 
you will, to a practical definition of what an elementary particle is. One 
may consider the following definition option:________________________
Definition
In the category of microscopic particles, those completely determined 
by a single time interval shall be considered as elementary in nature.______
Since all known particles have an associated energy E, the time interval 
T needed for a complete characterization of its dynamic nature might be 
defined by a relation of the type:
T = h/E, 
1
where h is Planck's constant.
Returning now to the spacetime characterization of physical objects by 
four-dimensional worldline tubes, and the three-dimensional slices thereof, 
two consecutive constant time-slices of its worldline, separated by the 
interval T of Eq.l, now suffice for the description of an elementary parti­
cle. A compound physical object, by contrast, would need a multitude of 
well labeled time-slices for its complete characterization. Its worldline 
would look like a multiple beaded string. By contrast, elementary particles 
resemble singly beaded strings.
The manifestation of time so acquires an arrowed marker given by the 
direction of the worldline. Its cyclic components are particle determined 
systems of equidistant time-slices on that worldline. Only for the 
elementary particle does the worldline assume the appearance of a singly 
beaded string.
3. Elementary Particles and Topological torsion
In the spirit of the picture of the worldline tube with equidistant time 
slices, the elementary particle may be said to replicate itself in the direction 
of the arrow of time. For a stable particle this process of replication in 
time is taken to be perfect without "aging." It could go on indefinitely, 
unless there is some collision event terminating the particle's existence.

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
201
For a semi-stable particle, time replication goes on until it terminates its 
existence either through spontaneous or collision-induced disintegration.
The self-renewal aspect of time replication is crucial. It adds a funda­
mentally dynamic feature to the particle's spatial existence. In space the 
particle is an isolated object. If there are several identical particles, each 
may be regarded as a replica of the others, yet all of them are taken to be 
spatially isolated nonadjacent objects. In the time direction, by contrast, 
replication is part of a particle's individual existence. The time replica re­
places the object from which it came a period earlier. This adjacency is 
characteristic of its time behavior as distinguished from its, in essence, 
isolated spatial aspects.
The following overall picture of elementary particle description now 
transpires. Based on the nature of the elementary particle, as perceived 
through presently available experimentation, the particle manifests itself as 
a worldline tube with, for that particle, a unique time periodicity according 
to Eq.l. Further structural detail of the particle now must be expected to 
be related to a configurational structure of a constant time-slice of its 
worldline tube.
At first, the separateness of time and spatial features seems to defy any 
chances for a spacetime invariant description. Knowing the proven physi­
cal virtues of the invariance properties of spacetime descriptions, a major 
conceptual hurdle still has remained in reconciling the vast epistemological 
differences implied by time and space descriptions with the equalizer con­
notations of spacetime invariance. The latter unquestionably seems to wash 
out those very distinctions and remains for many a psychological stumbling 
block in accepting spacetime invariant description as a constructive asset.
The cited predicament of reconciling epistemological distinctions with 
the great equalizer of spacetime invariance has plagued physics for many 
decades. Right from the start, after Einstein had enunciated the principle 
of general spacetime covariance as an axiomatic cornerstone of his theoret­
ical developments, the principle was attacked. In fact, it was declared to be 
physically void, and many modem renditions of the general theory of rela­
tivity reflect in varying degrees, a withdrawal from Einstein's originally 
more radical position.
The subsequent emergence of quantum mechanics as an exercise in 
solving eigenvalue problems, further compounded the situation. The many 
attempts at creating generally invariant Schroedinger and Dirac wave 
equations remained without physical perspectives. There was no gain that 
could be said to be commensurate with the efforts that went into these en­
deavors.
The issue presently confronting us, therefore, is one of weighing 
Einstein's early radicalism against the somewhat negative pragmatism un­
leashed by the criticism of the principle of general covariance. For this 

202
CHAPTER XIII
purpose, it is now instructive to take a good look at some purely topologi­
cal developments which also have led to analogous distinctive asymmetries 
in making the step from three to four dimensions. Even if there may, at 
this moment, be no immediate ground for interrelating the two mani­
festations of dimensional asymmetry, the similarities are sufficiently 
striking to justify further cognizance. The mathematical subject matter 
referred to here has a reputation of abstractness and abstruseness, an 
intuitive approach to the torsion concept in manifold topology, therefore, is 
called for.
Since the word "torsion" has a variety of connotations ranging from 
differential geometry to the theory of deforming elastic bodies, it should be 
made clear, from the onset, that topological torsion, as referred to here, is 
related neither to the torsion component of the linear connections of 
differential geometry, nor to the torsion concept of elastic deformation. 
Topological torsion represents an entirely different conceptual species. In 
the present context, the reasons for directing attention to this concept of 
topological torsion are threefold:
(1 ) Topological Torsion has a distinct periodicity feature, thus permit­
ting a possible accommodation of the previously given definition of the el­
ementary particle as a "time"-replicating entity.
(2 ) Topological Torsion first becomes manifest as a distinct one­
dimensional feature after making the transition from three to four dimen­
sions. It thus opens a rare option for describing the dynamics of physical 
experiences.
(3 ) This concept of torsion is a topologically invariant notion and there­
fore is perfectly compatible with a principle of general four-dimensional 
(spacetime) covariance. These topology-related matters invite an extension 
to a metric-free rendition of the principle of general covariance.
An inspection of the here-given criteria of recognition for topological 
torsion and a comparison with the previously given worldline tube de­
scription of elementary particles reveals a measure of similarity which is 
far too striking to be passed up for further scrutiny. Hence, in judging its 
physical potential, we need to explore the possibility of bringing physical 
heuristics closer to the mathematical idea of topological torsion.
4. 
Dimensional Restrictions on Torsion
While topology has, for some time, made inroads on the teaching of 
modem calculus courses attended by physicists, the subject, as taught, is 
normally restricted to the topology of point sets without many ramifica­
tions dealing with the topology of manifolds. The discipline dealing with 
the latter is referred to as "combinatorial topology." It has striking 

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
203
applications in three as well as higher dimensions, except that the visual 
contact is lost in the higher-dimensional realm. At this juncture, manifold 
topology becomes as abstract as point-set topology. The first attempts at 
bridging the conceptual gap between these two branches of topology 
started, in fact, with the search for a set theoretical foundation of the 
geometric notion of dimension.
Analogous to the transition from visual geometry to algebraic geome­
try, the higher-dimensional counterpart in topology has become known as 
algebraic topology. In an exploratory investigation of the interrelations 
between physics and topology, a cursory overview of some modern-day 
tools of algebraic topology is in order. Since a feature resembling topolog­
ical torsion already has been identified in the previous section and in 
chapter XII, the conceptual ingredients that have historically led to the 
notion of topological torsion, and the restrictions on its manifestation in 
manifolds, need to be discussed now.
The problem is to go about this assignment with sufficient mathematical 
precision so as not to risk immediate rejection from its professionals, while 
still retaining contact with a backdrop of reality to hold an interest for 
physics. For better or for worse, here is an attempt at such a heuristic re­
port of the salient points of the homology branch of algebraic topology. 
Tedious constructional phases of "simplicial" subdivisions of topological 
"configurations" are simply left out. No proofs are given in a traditional 
mathematical sense; just major concepts are mentioned and placed in a 
physically plausible perspective.
The word "configuration" is meant to cover here a diversity of terms 
used in the professional literature (e.g., "vertices domain" or "(curved) 
polyhedra" etc.). In the practice of physical applications, "configuration" 
refers here to domains of integration of physically relevant differential 
forms. The properties of differential forms of being closed forms or ex­
act forms have been used by de Rham to create a dual instrument of topo­
logical probing, called "cohomology." Physics invites a synthesis, between 
the homology of integration domains and the cohomology of forms that are 
being integrated. Here are preliminary installments of this scheme!
In the last part of the nineteenth century, the Italian mathematician, 
Betti, pioneered a topological characterization of geometric configurations 
in space, n=3, with the help of Abelian groups. For arbitrary n we have as 
elements of the groups in n-dimensional manifolds the, in principle, infinite 
sets of p-cycles (i.e., zero boundary or closed, p-dimensional hyper­
surfaces: p=l,...n) associated with a given geometric configuration. In 
Betti's visual spatial context, the cycles can be regarded as one-dimensional 
loops and two-dimensional closed surfaces. A general n-dimensional 
configuration can have cycles of dimensions 1,2, ....n.

204
CHAPTER XIII
The next step is subdividing this amorphous infinity of 1-cycles (or p- 
cycles) into subsets of bounding cycles, as distinct from the nonbounding 
cycles. This criterion for subdivision has been called "homology." The re­
sulting equivalence classes of homologous p-cycles form a finitely gener­
ated Abelian group, which is the difference (quotient) group of all cycles 
versus the subgroup of bounding cycles. The structure of this group of 
equivalence classes relates directly to the topological structure of the con­
figuration under consideration; it is called the "p-dimensional homology 
group" of that configuration. The topology of an n-dimensional configura­
tion is probed by (n+1) homology groups Hp with p=0,l,2,.... n. The
meaning for p=0 is still to be specified.
The groups Hp are Abelian and are considered to have a finite basis. It 
means Hp can be regarded as a module or a finite dimensional linear vector 
space if you will. The dimension rp of that vector space is called the rank 
of Hp and depends solely on the configuration being examined. The num­
ber rp (basis) is, in fact, a measure for the topological complexity of the 
configuration. For a given p, the number rp can be smaller, equal, or 
much, much bigger than p.
As a physical example, one may think of Gauss' law of electrostatics as 
a tool describing the topology of a distribution of elementary electrical 
charges in three-dimensional space. In that case, p=2 corresponds to the 
two-dimensional integration cycles for Gauss' law, and r2 relates to the 
number of electrons under consideration. The Gauss integral is zero if no 
charges, or no net charge, are enclosed. In establishing the basis dimension 
r2 , charge polarity needs to be taken into account. This basis dimension, or 
Betti number r2, can be enormously large for 2-cycles enclosing an 
electron cloud.
The torus gives a simple geometric example: for p=l, the basis ^=2 
corresponding to the azimuthal and meridional equivalence classes of cycles 
on the torus surface, for p=2 one has r2=l the torus surface itself.
The numbers rp , which give the rank of the basis of the Hp, say that Hp 
is the direct sum of rp Abelian subgroups of rank one. They are the 
generators of Hp; each generator group has its own unit elements ej with 
i=l,2,....rp . An arbitrary element of Hp is an equivalence class of cycles 
defined by an array of "multiples" of the unit elements ei (i.e., a vector in 
the vector space spanned by the basis of Hp). For the simple case of the 
torus, an arbitrary cycle with vector components [a,bl is a combination of 
"a" meridional windings and "b" azimuthal windings. In geometric cases 
the coefficient domain of the vector space are integers; in physics they can 
be multiples of units e, h and h/e.

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
205
An inspection of the torus example shows that the infinity of merid­
ional-azimuthal combination cycles contributes no essentially new in­
formation about the group structure of Hp , or rather H2, in this case. The 
most important structural element of Hp is the basis number rp; which is 2 
for the independent 1-cycles on the torus. The number rp is not affected, 
whether one takes as coefficient domains the integers or the rational 
numbers. The group is, after all, merely a tool for assessing the topological 
structure of the configurations being investigated.
The vector space picture for the cycle basis of Hp , so far, suggests that 
no rank-one subgroup of Hp might be cyclic of finite order. Unit elements 
of vector spaces usually are taken to be cyclic of infinite order, meaning 
one can never return to the origin after a finite number of operations.
Mindful of the dominant role of algebraic methodology in geometry and 
in topology when going to higher dimensions, Poincare first indicated that 
it might be meaningful to include the possibility of basis elements of finite 
cyclic order. The number rp thus includes rank-one groups of finite and 
infinite order. The generating groups of finite order form a subgroup of 
Hp, called the torsion group Tp associated with the dimension p.
From a purely algebraic point of view, there would be no dimensional 
restrictions on whether or not a given generating group can be a torsion 
group. However, there are restrictions as soon as the additive group is 
declared to be an homology group pertaining to a given topological 
configuration.
A specification still needs to be made for p=0. The elements of the 
homology group Ho are taken to denote the number of components of the 
configuration. A nontrivial torsion group is ruled out here (i.e., To=O). A 
single component configuration is thus denoted by a one-element group Hq. 
A similar specification holds for the top dimension. So torsion is ruled out 
for the group Hn {i.e., Tn=0). This specification is compatible with the 
possible occurrence of configurations with Poincare duality Hp=Hn_p. 
Hence, in general:
To=TnsO. 
2
Further restrictions on torsion are imposed by recurrence relations be­
tween the homology and torsion groups as a result of Alexander duality 
between the homology groups of any given configuration C and its 
complement with respect to the manifold Mn in which C exists:
Tr-1(C)«Tn.r.1(Mn-C). 
3
On the basis of Eqs.2 and 3, one easily establishes that torsion cannot 
exist in three dimensions. Torsion groups Tq and T3 vanish in view of 
Eq.2, still leaving the option of one- and two-dimensional torsion. For n=3 
and r=l, Eq.3 gives T/Mn-Cl-Tf/C); hence, Tj vanishes in view of Eq.2.

206
CHAPTER XIII
The result is general, because C and therefore Mn-C are arbitrary. 
Similarly the existence of T2 can be ruled out because Eq.3 does not permit 
negative dimension numbers.
Since To=T1=T2=T3=0, it follows: torsion is not possible in three 
dimensions or less. The geometric examples of torsion of the projective 
plane and the Klein bottle cited in the literature are somewhat contrived 
pseudo-visualizations which have their real origins in four dimensions.
Let us now check the situation for n=4. Starting with Eq.2, we have 
To=T4=0. Now, applying Eq.3 for r=2, one obtains Tj(C)—Tj(Mn-C), 
which indeed can be different from zero. For r=3, one obtains similarly, 
T2=0. The result T3=0 follows for r=4, because T4 is ruled out. Hence, for 
n=4; To=T2=T3=T4=O, yet T t^0, so, one-dimensional torsion can 
exist in four dimensions because T^O.
Modem textbooks on algebraic topology normally do not present proofs 
of torsion options in manifolds. At least two independent proofs of the 
torsion options in manifolds can be found in the classic topology text by 
Alexandroff and Hopf. 1 One proof calls on a decomposition theorem 
relating the Betti number r^ of C to the components of the complement 
configuration (Mn-C). The other proof is based on the Alexander duality 
between C and (Mn-C). The here-given account is a plausible version of 
the latter and is referred to in a footnote of ref.l. It makes this unusual 
and little-known result understandable, by calling directly on a fairly 
standard duality of algebraic topology.
Since the details of at least two full proofs have been given elsewhere by 
leading pioneers in the subject, the present arguments are only meant to 
serve as a frame of reference to show where these ideas come from and 
how they have evolved.
5. 
Torsion and Kuenneth Product Rules
The integration domains of multiple integrals frequently are configu­
rations that come about by product forming between configurations of 
lower dimension. For instance, the two-dimensional toms is a configura­
tion that may be regarded as the product of two one-dimensional cycles. In 
the light of the preceding discussions, it thus stands to reason to inquire 
how the homology groups of a product configuration relate to the 
homology groups of the product components.
An interest in the topology of product configuration is invited by their 
possible function as integration domains of period integrals. If the product 
structure of integration domains can be examined in the context of a 
corresponding product structure of the integrands, it is possible to come to 
some interesting conclusions for the evaluation of those integrals.

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
207
If differential forms happen to be products of differential forms of 
lower order, a multiple integral can simplify to a product of integrals. If 
the latter are, moreover, period integrals equatable to multiples of quanta, 
the evaluation of those multiple integrals then is immediate; they become 
products of quantum units and their quantum numbers._________________
This type of evaluations parallels the Cauchy method in the complex 
plane. It is even simpler, because the Cauchy process demands an 
evaluation of residues; here nature's quanta provide the residues. These 
options of product reduction point at a need to become informed about 
product homologies.
Let us now quote a major result, due to Kuennetz, as to how product 
homology relates to the homology of the components. Let Cp+q be a 
product configuration of the component configurations Cp and Cq in a 
manifold of n dimensions. For the index n going from 0 to n, the Cp+q 
homology groups then relate to the homology groups of Cp and Cq 
according to the relation:
Hn(Cp+q) « Z [Hr(Cp),Hn.r(Cq)] + Z [Tr(Cp),Tn.r_i(Cq)]. 
4
Eq.4 simplifies considerably in the light of the earlier-discussed restrictions 
on torsion groups. A four -dimensional space gives n the range n=0,1...4, 
and assuming for Cp and Cq cycles of dimensions p=l and q=2 
respectively, the second summation vanishes, because one of the torsion 
groups always vanishes.
The following relations are thus obtained when taking into consideration 
that Ci has only two nontrivial homology groups: H0(C!), H^Cj) and C2 
can have three nontrivial homology groups: H0(C2), Hj(C2), H2(C2). They 
give four nontrivial homology groups for C3=C1x C2 , the product cycle. 
Writing out the summations of Eq.4, they are:
Ho(C3)=Ho(C1),Ho(C2)
H1(C3)=Ho(C1),H1(C2)+H1(C1),Ho(C2)
H2(C3)=Ho(C1),H2(C2)+H1(C1),H1(C2)
H3(C3)=H1(C1),H2C2) . 
5
The commas of the bracket expressions in Eq.4, still appearing in Eq.5, are 
to be understood as additive connectors.
The Eq.5 become a more transparent once we become more specific 
about the homology groups of the components. While the homology groups 
of the lower-dimensional configurations can be verified by visual inspec­
tion, Eq.4 has the virtue of helping to obtain an insight into the potential 
homology structures of higher-dimensional configurations where visual in­
spection fails us. In four dimensions though, kinematic behavior gives an 
additional realization potential for topological configurations, over and 

208
CHAPTER XIII
beyond the traditional three-dimensional geometric realizations used in 
standard topology.
Instead of dealing with the homology group elements themselves 
denoting equivalence classes of cycles, it is more elucidating to cite the 
rank rp(d) or Betti number, which gives the group basis. The compound 
symbol rp(d) thus enumerates the group basis of the p-th homology group 
of a d-dimensional configuration. They identify the number of indepen­
dent equivalence classes of boundaries and cycles that are the elements of 
the homology groups. Here are some specifics:
Let Cj be the topological equivalent of a circle; its Betti numbers are 
(1,1). The first Betti number 1 signifies that there is only one (circle) com­
ponent, the second Betti number 1 says the circle itself is a single equiv­
alence class indicating a one-element group. The topological equivalent of 
the sphere has the Betti numbers (1,0,1). The first and the last Betti 
numbers "1" are also here similarly identified as for the circle. The zero 
in the middle says all one dimensional circles on the sphere are boundaries 
separating the surface, in the sense of a Jordan curve into two parts. The 
sphere is said to be simply connected or more precisely, the sphere is one- 
connected, because the one-cycles on the sphere are all boundaries 
constituting an equivalence class identified by the zero-th element of a 
trivial homology group of zero basis (i.e., rj(2)=0).
A three-dimensional sphere, or the topological equivalent thereof, has 
Betti numbers (1,0,0,1). It is also said to be simply connected or more 
specifically it is 1- and 2-connected. The 4-sphere has Betti numbers 
(1,0,0,0,1), simple-connectedness here means 1, 2, and 3-connectedness.
Definition: The Betti numbers rp(n)=l for p=0 and p=n and rp(n)=0 
for 0>p>n are taken as criterion for simple-connectedness of cyclic 
n-dimensional configurations.
A torus surface is the product of two circles. Visual inspection reveals 
its Betti numbers as (1,2,1). One also easily verifies this by writing out the 
terms of Eq.4. Let us now consider the 3-dimensional product 
configuration of a circle (1,1) and a sphere (1,0,1). Eq.5 can now be used 
to write down immediately the Betti numbers for the three-dimensional 
product configuration:
Cjx C2= (1,1,1,1). 
7
For the product of a circle and a three-sphere one obtains from Eq.4 for 
the Betti numbers of the four dimensional product configuration
Ctx C3= (1,1,0,1,1). 
8

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
209
The product of two 2-spheres (1,0,1) gives, by contrast, 
C2x C2= (1,0,1,0,1). 
9
A comparison of the Betti numbers for configurations Eqs.7,8,9 shows that 
Eqs.7, 8 and 9 satisfy the symmetry of the so-called "Poincare duality" 
relation
rp=rn-p • 
10
The same can be said for the Betti numbers of the circle, sphere and torus. 
It means Poincare duality (only) holds for closed configurations (i.e., 
configurations with zero boundary). The products of the closed 
configurations, here considered, are again closed.
There is another remarkable feature that product configurations have in 
common; they are not simply connected, even if the factors of the product 
are. An inspection of all the given examples verifies the given statement. 
Since this property is needed for applications to be discussed in the next 
section, let us state this as a lemma for future reference:
Lemma I: Product configurations are not simply connected.
As a second Lemma, one can verify the converse statement:
Lemma II: A simply connected configuration cannot be represented as 
a product of lower-dimensional configurations.
As mentioned earlier, torsion does not play any role in the given 
product discussions. While torsion can have a one-dimensional manifes­
tation in four dimensions, it cannot have an independent role in the lower 
dimensional factor configurations. The torsion feature can thus be injected 
as an option, according to imposed epistemological needs, only after the 
product configuration requires a four-dimensional imbedding..
6. 
Homology of Integration Cycles, Cohomology of Forms
The present concern with homology theory was predicated by the need 
for an improved understanding of the topology of integration domains of 
multiple integrals. As mentioned earlier, homology started in the 19th 
century and developed further in the beginning of this century. The 
Kuennetz product rules, for instance, go back to the Twenties. In the 
course of time, other methods for probing topological structure were 
developed.
A method that was in part dual to homology theory emerged under the 
name of contra-homology or briefly "cohomology." This procedure has 
been given, for physics, an especially poignant form by de Rham. The 
mathematical development took place in the Thirties. Starting in the early 

210
CHAPTER XIII
part of the 19th century, physics had been using isolated fragments of what 
has now been integrated by de Rham into a full-fledged theory of co­
homology. Let us delineate the principal mathematical features of coho­
mology as a structural dual to homology, then after this is done physics­
based connotations can be injected.
If homology is based on the rather subtle conceptual difference between 
cycles that are boundaries versus cycles that are not boundaries, cohomol­
ogy is based on the conceptual distinction between differential forms that 
are closed versus those that are exact. While all boundaries are cycles, not 
all cycles are boundaries. Similarly all exact forms are closed; yet not all 
closed forms are exact. The exact forms are a subset in the set of closed 
forms, as boundaries similarly are a subset in the set of cycles. Since these 
sets are also Abelian groups one may consider their subdivision in terms of 
equivalence classes having the group property. The difference (quotient) 
group of closed p-forms versus exact p-forms is called the cohomology 
group Hp, similarly as the difference group of p-cycles versus p-boundaries 
is called a homology group Hp. The importance of these dual constructs is 
their conditional isomorphism
HP Hp, 
11
which is contingent on the absence of torsion properties in Hp , because Hp 
has no torsion equivalent. This means Tp is an asymmetry feature between 
homology and cohomology.
Let us reiterate here these and other symmetries and asymmetries in 
homology and cohomology. A differential form A is said to be closed if 
its exterior derivative vanishes: dA = O. The condition is not sufficient for 
exactness. The symbol d stands for the exterior derivative operation 
(alternating differentiation); similarly, the symbol 3 is taken to stand for 
the boundary operation on a given configuration (chain). While the 
boundary of a boundary is zero: 33 = 0, also the exterior derivative applied 
twice vanishes: dd = O. The relevance of these general identities to familiar 
mathematical operations commonly used in physics becomes clear by 
noting how the identities in three dimensions curl grad s 0 and div curl 
= 0 are special cases of dd=O. Details are found in texts dealing with the 
subject matter of differential forms (compare chapter VI).
A differential p-form B is exact if it derives from a (p-1) form A 
(e.g., B=dA). Since ddsO, operating again with d gives dB=0.
Warning: a local global distinction related to closed and exact is re­
flected in the information that the knowledge dB=0 does not permit a con­
clusion (standard for a long time in physics) that a form A (globally) exists 
such that dA=B.

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
211
In different wording: the property of an exact form of being closed 
does not permit an inversion by concluding that closed forms are derivable 
from forms of lower order (e.g., a so-called "potential"). In making such 
unjustified inversions of conclusions, one throws out precisely the 
possibility of making a cohomology probe of the (field) configurations that 
are being assessed. While pioneering 19th century physicists seemed mostly 
aware that this inversion was subject to restrictions, the subtlety of the cited 
distinction has escaped later generations. Half a century of off-and-on 
searches for magnetic monopoles has been largely precipitated by a tacit 
belief in this inversion viability. It testifies to the relevance of these 
mathematical subtleties.
Whether a field or form is "closed" or "exact" is fundamentally an issue 
to be decided by experimental inquiry. The magnetic monopole inquiry 
testifies to this fact. Yet, questions are justified as to how many times 
physical research should be allowed to ignore Nature's resounding "NO" to 
the magnetic monopole inquiry. The conceptual inertia displayed in these 
forever recurring investigations is the more questionable now that the 
physical relevance of a globally existing potential A for the field of 
magnetic induction B has proven its global significance through the many 
physical applications of the Aharonov-Bohm integral.
Not only in economics, but also in contemporary physics has a 
consensus abounded favoring the idea of having one's cake and eating it 
too. A delineation of priorities is therefore necessary to make it clear that 
the following selection of differential forms and their physical implications 
don't permit easy compromises jeopardizing cohomological principles.
As fundamental 1,2 and 3 forms that are "closed," we consider:
1. The pair 1-form A defined by the vector and scalar potentials {A,<|>} 
explored by London, Aharonov and Bohm.
2. The impair 2-form G defined by the displacement D and the 
magnetic field H, which gives a spacetime substantiation of the laws of 
Ampere and Gauss.
3. 
The impair product form R^G suggested by Kiehn.2
The residues or periods of these differential forms are respectively in 
terms of units of flux h/e, elementary units of charge e and the ele­
mentary units of action h (i.e., integrated spin or angular momentum):
l. | A = flux linked by a q residing where dA=O.

2. G = charge world lines linked by a c2 residing where dG=0.

3. = act*on "enclosed" by a c3 residing where dCR^G^O.

CHAPTER XIII
The completion of a physics-based cohomology now is contingent on 
finding exact 1, 2, and 3 forms. An exact 2-form is defined by the electric 
field E and the magnetic induction B: F = dA. An exact 3-form C is defined 
by the charge density p and the current density j. It obeys the relation 
C=d(i (the matter-based Maxwell equations), because the 2-form G is 
defined by displacement D and magnetic field H.
The Pfaffian integrability classes of A give additional options for exact 
1,2 and 3 forms according to the following scheme, based on a theorem by 
Darboux. This theorem reduces the one-form A to bilinear expressions of 
four independent spacetime scalars a,|3,y,<5. They represent, in the 
following manner, the four distinct cases of integrability:
1. A= d|3 
A*O;dA = O 
15
2. A=yd<5 
dA*O;A^dA = O 
16
3. A=yd<S + d|3 
Az,dA*0; dA/sdA = O 
17
4. A = yds + ad|3 
dA^dA*O. 
18
Case 1, Eq.15 yields, by definition, an exact one-form R, because it 
derives from a scalar |3.
Case 2, Eq.16 yields an already-mentioned exact 2-form dA = F, which 
is physically defined by the electric field E and the magnetic induction B.
Case 3, Eq.17 is governed by a 3-form A/sdA. This 3-form is at least 
closed, because its exterior derivative is given as dA/sdA = O. There is a 
rough-and-ready rule for differential forms claiming closed form^ exact 
form=exact form, which needs to be applied with caution. The 3-form 
A/sdA does not always have to be be exact, because the integral criterion 
for exactness
A/sdA = 0; for all cycles c3 
19
C3
holds if dA is of rank 2, as is true for case 3. Applying Stokes' Law to 
Eq. 19, the integral over the 4-dimensional interior of c3 has a vanishing 
integrand in view of the accessory requirement dA^dA = 0 for case 3.
Case 4, Eq.18 reflects a situation of minimal integrability, dA is of 
rank 4. It is described by a nonzero 4-form: dAz,dA* 0. This nonvanishing 
4-form is physically equivalent to a nonzero spatial scalar product E-B^O 
of electric and magnetic fields. Stokes' theorem now says the integral 
Eq. 19 is nonzero. The rough rule closed^exact=exact is now invalid.

213
Case 4 generates the following sequence of cyclic integrals of 1, 2 and 3 
dimensions:
* o 
nonzero periods of flux, 
20
ffdAsO 
zero periods: no magnetic monopoles, 21
nonzero periods of (flux)2 ; see ref. 3. 
22
Eqs.20,21,22 formally wrap up the possible integrability situations 
pertaining to A. Note for future reference that, even for integrability case 
4, Eq. 19 can still be met, provided the cycles C3 are restricted to products 
of 1 and 2-cycles
c3 = c,xc2. 
23
The Kuennetz product rule gives
M A„dA = f A I dAsO, 
24
V v v Q 
J Q J Q
implying, in view of Lemma II, that Eq.22 can only be nonzero for simply 
connected c3. Eq.24 follows from Stokes' theorem:
Mc2dfH3c/-0. 
25
Integral Eq.25 vanishes, because the boundary of a cycle is zero: 3c2=0. 
Conversely, if all cyclic integrals of a form vanish, the form is exact.
Eq.25 says that F = d A, all by itself, can never establish a 2-con- 
nectedness in spacetime. Yet what F can't do, another form can! The 2- 
form G of Eq. 13, which is defined by the displacement D and the magnetic 
field H, assumes the role of establishing 2-connectedness in spacetime. The 
Gauss theorem of electrostatics joins here with Ampere's law, and together, 
they assume a dynamic spacetime role.
In contrast to the integral given by Eq.24, an integral of the product 
form RAG of Eq. 14, for a corresponding product configuration of integra­
tion c3 = C]xc2, now translates into a finite 3-connectednes that is coupled to 
what can be a nonzero 2-connectedness:
A^G = | A G = action-integrated "spin"; c3 = c1xc2 . 26 
C1 C2
Until this point, the discussion has centered around integrations over 
cyclic configurations. Integrability case 4 invites a look at the interior of 
cycles (e.g., integrals of the 4-forms dA/sdA = F/sF and GzvG and F/xG taken 
over spacetime interiors). Using the equivalent field quantities of standard 
Maxwell theory they appear in more familiar attire as integrals over time 
element dt and space elements dV respectively :

29
Unlike the integrand of Eq.27, the 4-forms of the integrands of Eqs.28 
and 29 are not in general derivatives of 3-forms. Yet, as is too frequently 
done in physical applications, in charge-free space one can locally take ex­
ception to this restriction by locally defining the existence of such a 3- 
form. In charge free space, the Lagrangian integrand of Eq.29, for in­
stance, is a pure divergence of the vector 4>D - RxH. It is not, in general, 
possible, however, to globally extend such definitions, because they violate 
basic cohomology distinctions by taking closed to be exact.
It is even less permissible to make an exact form closed, as shown by the 
inverse predicament of the absent magnetic monopole. In the first case, 
one takes advantage, for the purpose of expediency, of the fact that things 
don't exist locally that in principle could exist there. In the monopole case, 
one assumes things to exist that, according to cohomology, can't exist. 
Expediency may accept a risk, yet magnetic charge violates a truth.
A conscientious distinction between the notions closed and exact, in 
conjunction with Stokes' theorem, is therefore at the heart of any attempt at 
a cohomological restructuring of physical theory. The cycle-boundary dis­
tinction, in conjunction with the separation feature of a Jordan-Brouwer 
cycle, is similarly at the heart of homology.
7. Cohomology Characterization of Physical Objects
Having thus outlined the ingredients for an homology of integration 
domains of differential forms, and a corresponding cohomology of forms 
with conspicuous physical connotations, new questions arise whether or not 
they can be synthesized into a tool aiding existing theories of elementary 
particle structure. All there is at this point are fragments of past and pre­
sent knowledge that are indicative of such possibilities. In reporting about 
them, one finds there is too little to speak of a full-fledged theory; yet, 
there is enough so as to be reluctant to discard the whole effort as a 
hopeless endeavor.
Since we are trying here to classify particles with the equivalent of Betti 
numbers identifying the bases of pairs of homology-cohomology groups, 
the possibilities offered by this scheme seem, in principle, ample to ac­
commodate the relatively small number of stable and semi-stable elemen­
tary particles.
An important question in this context is whether the classification can be 
expected to be unique. The answer is "no." The homology classification of 

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
215
geometric objects is already known not to be unique, in the sense that 
topologically distinct configurations can have the same Betti numbers.
The same is true, and even more so, for a cohomology classification. 
For the purposes of physics, there is the added distinction between pair and 
impair forms. This distinction is not normally acknowledged in mathemati­
cal discussions. The pair/impair distinction in physics relates to matters of 
orientability and the associated particle pairing principles of physics. A 
synthesis of homology and cohomology is needed to optimize results.
Notwithstanding reported negatives, to be taken as warnings against un­
due expectations, an abundance of differential forms can be identified as 
relating to fundamental physical fields. They leave little doubt about a rele­
vance, in some form or another, for the purpose of ordering manifestations 
in the sense of a physical cohomology. While an inspection of the litera­
ture shows a fair number of publications dealing with the role of differen­
tial forms in physics, closer scrutiny reveals a great reluctance to develop 
these matters into, even an outline of, a cohomology for physics. Reasons 
for this reluctance need to be identified.
From a practical point of view, one would like to start with what topo­
logically seem to be the simplest physical objects of nature (e.g., elemen­
tary particles). For reasons that hardly need much elaboration, the 
physical laws associated with the differential forms discussed in the 
previous section normally are considered as macrophysical in nature, 
without a true applicability in the micro- and submicroscopic domains. 
Modem physics has shrouded these microscopic domains, and, even more 
so, the submicroscopic domains, in a sea of fuzziness created by what is 
known as quantum mechanical uncertainty. A total and unmitigated sub­
scribing to the uncertainty notions of contemporary physics stops any 
microphysical cohomology investigation in its tracks, and that is exactly 
what has happened.
The present investigation was not started, though, just to withdraw 
from this endeavor prior to testing at least some of its potential for particle 
physics. Essential for this follow-up is a position which takes the viability 
of the contemporary "readings" of the axiom of uncertainty as unaccept­
able. Quantum mechanical uncertainty, as presently known, stands in the 
way of a systematic cohomological exploration of the particle realm. The 
metric-free structure of the thus far mentioned differential expressions is 
taken as a supporting inducement for taking this course of action. The 
metric gives us the macro-micro distinction; hence, the metric absence then 
takes away a major hurdle preventing macro-»micro extrapolation.
Let us now explore how elementary particle properties interact with the 
cohomological connotations of flux, electric charge, and spin as expressed 
by period integrals Eqs.l2,13,and 14. Charge and spin are properties that 
can be directly attributed to elementary particles through experimentation.

216
CHAPTER XIII
The integral of flux, however, gives us some trouble. Here are some of the 
reasons.
Elementary particles are known to have magnetic moments, which can 
be evaluated experimentally with great precision. In macroscopic situa­
tions, we are used to associating a magnetic flux with a magnetic moment. 
If the flux is not closed on itself, such as in the case of flux linked by a 
torus-ring, it will have an external magnetic-moment manifestation. The 
mutual relations between magnetic moment and magnetic flux, therefore, 
are not unique. Flux can, in part, be torus-enclosed, whereas another part 
leaks out as an experimentally observable dipole moment. The flux­
moment relations present us with questions regarding how to obtain 
independent knowledge of each. Such information could be indicative of 
specifics concerning the elementary particle's interior structure. In the 
present cohomological context, flux shall be regarded as a more 
fundamental concept than magnetic moment. The latter is seen as a sec­
ondary entity derivable from flux.
Tables of elementary particle properties give us listings of their masses 
in terms of energy units mev, thus covering finite restmass as well as zero 
restmass particles. These data are experimentally obtained from energy­
momentum exchanges in collision processes. The cohomology classifica­
tion, here attempted, still does not give us information about ratios of par­
ticle masses or energies. The period integrals Eqs.12,13, and 14 give us, at 
best, indirect clues as to the nature of the energies involved.
Table II gives a preliminary idea how Betti numbers could be as­
signed to some familiar elementary particles. While the Betti numbers for 
electron and muon are easily identified, the photon, by contrast, remains 
the least descript. Photon action, according to Eq. 29, should vanish, yet 
circularly polarized photons are known to carry angular momentum ±h. 
Electro-flux JdtjE-dr and magnetic flux J^B-dS, when taken in a cyclic 
context, cancel on account of flux conservation, yet their individual 
magnitudes remain available as entities characteristic of photons.
As far as cohomology is concerned, it still remains true that electron 
and muon could be considered as perfectly identical entities. Hence the 
electron/muon enigma still stands out as largely unaffected by a cohomo­
logical probing. At this point, there is a reasonable cohomology-based ar­
gument accounting for the magnetic moment anomaly, which electron and 
muon have in common. For the higher order difference, there is at best a 
qualitative argument in terms of a small, yet inescapable, closed flux 
leakage associated with a trefoil model for electron and muon.
Quantum cohomology yields a very preliminary qualitative insight into 
the stationary structures of at least some prominent elementary particles. If 
we now include the stability versus instability features offered by the inte­
gral Eqs.22,27, also transitions between particles can be seen in a quantum 

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
217
cohomological perspective. It offers an elucidating qualitative insight into 
a possible understanding of Feynman diagrams by looking at them as four­
dimensional neuron nets. The neuron centers are the event domains, where 
particles are taken apart to be reassembled into new particles. Particle 
properties of Table II are exchanged in event-domains. Charge and spin 
are conserved, flux conservation and topology are now available to be 
related to some of the known empirical number conservation rules.
Table n is an attempt at a cohomological classification of elementary particles of the stable 
and semi-stable category. The Betti number r0 secures the single component structure. The 
Betti number r4 conveys the worldline manifestation of the particle object in question. The 
combination actionX) and B internal implies spin=0.

CHAPTER XIII
The stable worldline tubes can only terminate in an event domain, if a 
collision induces such an event to take place. The semi-stable worldline 
tubes can terminate spontaneously in an event domain. The length of a 
worldline tube that branches spontaneously (i.e.,without entering into a 
collision) measures the intrinsic lifetime of the particle in question. The 
worldline "length" represents a measure for the progression of arrowed 
time. The inner dynamics of the particle establishes through Eq.l a cyclic 
time characteristic of the particle. The particle worldline tube thus appears 
as an arrowed time string, which is beaded in terms of its own cyclic time.
The depicted Feynman diagram situation can further be specified in an 
homological sense. The event domain is taken to be the topological equiva­
lent of a four-dimensional ball and is, by virtue of this fact, simply con­
nected. The worldline tube, by contrast, is a four-dimensional product of a 
one-dimensional arc of arrowed time displacement and a three-dimensional 
configuration pertaining to the spatial particle structure. This worldline 
tube configuration is not simply connected by virtue of Lemma I.
The one-dimensional torsion number of a worldline tube configuration 
in spacetime is the lifetime of the particle in terms of its own characteristic 
cyclic time.
A crucial point for physical applicability is a cohomological distinction 
between event domains of instability and worldline tube domains of sus­
tained stable particle life. The following theorem helps out in finding a 
distinguishing criterion between entities known as physical stable or semi­
stable particles and physical events were particles undergo transitions:
Theorem: The Pfaffian integral (Eqs.22,27) vanishes, at all times, for 
the product domains of worldline tubes (Eq.24) of particles, whereas, by 
virtue of Lemma II, it can be different from zero if, and only if, the 
event domain is simply connected. This property makes Eq.24 a suitable 
candidate for assuming the role of a particle stability criterion.
8. Conclusion
The presented mathematical outline of a quantum cohomology can, at 
this point, hardly be regarded as a logically complete structure that can be 
developed from a few well-chosen axioms. Such axiomatic procedures are 
rare in mathematics, and even more so in physics. Confrontation with the 
reality of physical observation is bound to restrain and guide human imagi­
nation from what we believe things to be, towards what nature is trying to 
tell us how things really are.
A measure of justification for the here-chosen course of action in the 
direction of a quantum cohomology has been given by some quantitative 

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
219
applications ranging from macroscopic quantum effects to applications to 
the electron itself. In the light of the prominent role of the methods of 
period integration in the cited examples, we would have forsaken our 
obligation to the subject by not carrying matters further along the lines of a 
development that was, in part, already available in mathematics.
The conflict situation that has arisen with respect to the standard meth­
ods of quantum mechanics makes it mandatory to realign Copenhagen 
views. An epistemological assessment^ strongly reaffirms early pro­
nouncements by Einstein^ and Popper^ about the ensemble connotation of 
the wave function of quantum mechanics (compare chapters III-V).
Since homology and cohomology are not exactly household words in 
everyday physics, let us mention some mathematical sources that have well 
served this reluctant neophyte in these subjects. Apart from an earlier 
mentioned classical textbook by Alexandroff and Hopfl on homology, 
de Rham’s early papers and textbook J together with a monograph by 
Hodge& have served as primary sources for cohomology theory. Many 
newer texts are available; they may be cast in less accessible language. The 
just-mentioned classics have the advantage of starting from scratch and 
using simpler language. De Rham’s text is the only one which makes the, 
for physics, so essential distinction between pair and impair differential 
forms. Relevant information about the pair/impair distinction, and its 
relation to tensor species compatible with applying Neumann's principle to 
media symmetries, have been compiled by Schouten,9 a survey of essentials 
is given in Chapter VI of this text.
In the course of these discussions, the metric-free aspects of certain 
physical-law statements have been mentioned time and again to justify an 
extrapolation of macrophysical laws into the microphysical domain. The 
first discoveries of metric-free aspects emerged in the Twenties and 
Thirties through the work of Kottler, Cartan and van Dantzig. An easily 
accessible discussion of the mathematical facts can be found in a book by 
Whittaker.I® A discussion of some physical implications of metric inde­
pendence, in connection with period integrals as counting laws, has been 
given by the present author: 11 an overview in chapter VI. Applications of 
period laws to the quantum Hall effect 12 and the electron's anomalous 
magnetic moment^ have led to experimentation with quantum cohomol­
ogy where standard methods show diminishing returns (chapters VIII, IX).
There has been a conspicuous reluctance in either accepting, or even 
considering the period integral methods of quantum cohomology. Also at­
tempts at taking issue with them have been conspicuously absent. The ori­
gin of this evasiveness can only be traced back to what is believed to be a 
conflict situation with standard quantum methods and an ensuing 

220
CHAPTER Xin
overpreoccupation to seek solutions within the existing realm. More radical 
reassessment of prevailing views of quantum mechanics is still on hold.
In extolling mathematical virtues against physical virtues, and vice 
versa, let us make a comparison of the conceptual ingredients and quantita­
tive results for a quantum electrodynamics (QED) approach and a quantum 
cohomology (QC) approach to the anomalous moment of the electron (see
chapter VIII):
1.

are metric-based.
QC

2. Electron-muon topology

speed of light.

5. Quantitative account of

6. Leads to discrepancies 
with on data from other 
sources for higher order 
predictions: see ref. 14
No quantitative comparison 
in view of unavailable 
quantitative higher order 
predictions.
The reader should note that the comparison under point 3 lists, in ei­
ther case, propositions that may be considered weird. The energy infinities 
of QED need to be weighed against the QC proposition of permitting the 
speed of light for the substance of charge. The absence of metric-based 
restrictions for the 3-form of charge and current density brings the latter 
proposition within the realm of formal acceptability. Supporters of QED 
procedures, naturally, can make a similar claim; their methods for 
trimming out infinities make infinities more acceptable.
A qualitative understanding of the electron's negative higher order cor­
rections in the QC is due to the trefoil's inherent azimuthal leakage of flux 
closing on itself which, for that reason, can't contribute to the electron's 
magnetic moment. The muon's positive higher-order correction can then 

QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY
221
be attributed only to an increased electrostatic energy outweighing the de­
crease due to azimuthal flux leakage (compare chapter XI).
A comparison of the Dirac equation's spinorial justification for the 
electron's half-integer spin h/2 versus the trefoil's quantum cohomologi­
cal argument, reveals a relation between spinorization and orientability. 
This aspect has been discussed by HaefligerJS it lends uniqueness to the 
enantiomorhism of the trefoil's double-loop knot, which imposes a 4k inte­
gration loop on the integral of Eq. 12. Since this integral enters into the 
expression of Eq. 14 for integrated spin, the ensuing differential spin in the 
Dirac equation is the value of Eq. 14 prior to the integration over 4k: i.e., 
h/4tr = h/2. The Dirac-QC comparison for justifying the electron's half 
integer differential spin gives:
Dirac Eq.
half integer spin corresponds 
to unit operation 4k of the 
spin group, which, in turn, 
reflects orientability and the 
possibility of enantiomorphic 
pairing. 15
QC
half integer spin corresponds 
to 4k trefoil loop integration, 
based on the prerequisite of 
enantiomorphic pairing, which 
needs an orientable 
spacetime. 15
For the quantum Hall effect, QC methods hardly compare with the else­
where-proposed applications of the many particle Schroedinger equation. 
Proponents of the Schroedinger approach expect to obtain, in this fashion, 
evidence for the mesoscopic order manifest in the quantum Hall observa­
tions. This expectation creates the predicament of how to accommodate the 
statistics inherent to this method in a situation of near-perfect order. Only a 
nonclassical statistics can be made to perform such acts of disappearance. 
The QC, by contrast, starts out accepting the cyclotron lattice order, which 
reopens the field to yesteryear's simplicity of period integration, while re­
jecting, by the same token, the applicability of Schroedinger methods to 
such highly ordered situations.
The conceptual ingredients of cohomology have been prepared in the 
workshop of mathematics, some of it, perhaps, inspired by physics, but 
then made independent to stand on its own. Others have lifted the idea of 
metric-free aspects of physical law out of anonymity. It is de Rham's 
cohomology of differential forms in conjunction with aspects of metric 
independence that call for resurrecting period integrals as a major tool of 
global methodology in physics.
Contemporary quantum mechanics, with its uncertainty thesis and its 
multidimensional configuration spaces, has prevented physics from fully 
embracing developments in spacetime cohomology. It is hard, and perhaps 

222
CHAPTER XIII
literally the long way around, to find physically relevant and cohomologi­
cally complete sets of closed and exact differential forms in higher-dimen­
sional configuration spaces, in the expectation there will somehow exist a 
reduction that gives physical meaning in spacetime.
In recent times, "string" theory related topological explorations of 
higher dimensionalities by E. Witten^ and others remind us that all of this 
is, after all, pursued in order to account for spacetime physical experi­
ences. Witten calls attention to metric-free aspects of these developments. 
This "new" metric independence has, so far, not shown an awareness of the 
earlier metric independent work of the Twenties and Thirties (compare in­
dex references to metric-independence). Yet, these recent reports can be 
taken as an encouragement to support Witten in his call for a metric-free 
(extended) principle of general covariance for spacetime physics, because 
this extended covariance permits the one and only invariant reconciliation 
between quantum principles and general theory of relativity (chapter XV).
Yet similar as Whittaker'slO account of the metric-free work of Cartan 
and others, also this new wave of awareness of "metric independence" re­
mains in a physical state of indecision. There is no answer as to why na­
ture would make part of physics independent of the existence of a 
Riemannian metric structure. Neither is there a mentioning of the 
macro-*micro implications of metric-free, nor an identification of metric­
independence as a prerequisite for an invariant counting of quanta.
The epistemological assessment of quantum mechanics by Einstein and 
Popper in the early Thirties remains a sine qua non for physics to escape 
from the intimidation of Copenhagen's "painted comer" of those who were 
incapable of understanding. The Popper move initiated the liberation of 
physics from the dominant rule of the single-system wave functions. In so 
doing, he opened up a possibility of erecting a global spacetime quantum 
extension on Maxwell theory, which, in turn, makes possible a physically 
relevant spacetime quantum cohomology.
Since spacetime's algebraic geometry now has an undeniable physics 
connotation through the general theory of relativity, a similar association 
must be expected for a spacetime algebraic topology. That is what this 
chapter aims at doing, on an exploratory basis. As the relevance of this as­
sociation dawns at the horizon of awareness, Poincare torsion emerges as 
an asymmetry between homology and cohomology.
The kinematics of periodic phenomena naturally invites a torsion asso­
ciation. Periodicity in space can somehow be visualized only as object­
multiplicity. Periodicity in time, by contrast, is a self-replicating feature 
of a single object in spacetime. The exclusiveness of an inherent self-repli- 
cating cyclic property of a single physical object manifests itself, for the 
first time, in the four-dimensional context of a kinematic periodic phe­

nomenon. The same is true for the abstract torsion concept of algebraic 
topology. The possibility of whether time periodicity is a valid physical 
realization of Poincare's torsion is not to be ignored.
A principal objective of this chapter aims at establishing the feasibility 
of a model-based visual counterpart of the very abstract methods of quan­
tum electrodynamics QED and quantum chromodynamics QCD. In the 
spirit of earlier considerations about topological torsion, the word "visual" 
is here to be taken in the static as well as in the dynamic, four-dimensional 
sense of kinematic observation. An existence and possible use of model­
based alternatives to the otherwise exclusively forbidding abstractions of 
QED and QCD is something whose time may have come, provided a re­
duced role of quantum uncertainty can be accepted. In mathematics, the 
possibility of torsion at the homology end, and its absence at the cohomol­
ogy end has, at times, been cited as a disturbing asymmetry. In spacetime 
assessment, this asymmetry is found to have an essential function for the 
interpretation of cyclic and arrowed time. In the spirit of weak homology, 
it permits a closing of time-integration loops of period integrals. It makes 
possible a synthesis of homology and cohomology to accommodate a topol­
ogy of objects and a topology of events.
The content of this chapter owes an important input from many early 
discussions with the late David Bourgin and with Robert M. Kiehn during 
my stay at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas.

CHAPTER XIV
OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
1. The Art of Explaining
Most attempts at explaining something unfamiliar are based on a reduc­
tion to something else with which an audience has already a measure of 
familiarity, hi fact, it is said to be a mathematician's dream to erect all of 
mathematics on a set of axioms that can be regarded as self-evident truth. 
This characterization indicates an interrelational quality inherent to the art 
of explaining and, by the same token, it reflects somewhat a cynic's view, 
in the sense that understanding is in no small degree a matter of becoming 
acustomed to things. The battle between formalism and intuitionism is 
living proof, though, that there is no such thing as a "last truth," even in 
mathematics. If it is already dangerous to navigate blindly on "isms" in 
mathematics, one may certainlyexpect the same to be the case in physics.
Whatever "explaining" does to us, its effectiveness depends on the 
knowledge and images with which the recipients of those explanations are 
already familiar. That is why an explanation, to some, can be a convolution 
of reason to others. In a variation on the Shakespearean admonition that 
beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it can be said that whatever constitutes 
an explanation is in the mind of the beholder.
Mindful that standard explanations are of the interrelational type of 
reduction to familiars, more rare are explanations requiring new additions 
to the arsenal of fundamental concepts that constitute an existing body of 
knowledge. An event, which most of us would consider as belonging in this 
category, is the discovery of the calculus. It introduced such brand-new 
notions as "infinitesimals" and the infinite summations thereof. Here the 
reduction to, at that time, familiar concepts suddenly failed. The mind, 
then, must be conditioned to accept those new fundamentals. Yet, before 
welcoming new items as worthy new members of a Hall of Fame of 
Fundamentals, criteria for admission need to be established. The arsenal of 
fundamentals should retain its inner logical consistency, which means 
compatibility with existing fundamentals should be checked.
Obviously, reluctance is called for in introducing new fundamental 
concepts, lest we run the risk of building houses of cards that are liable to 
collapse in the wake of only minor disturbances. Mathematics traditionally
224

OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
225
has been more conscientious then physics in the handling of fundamentals. 
Yet, in defense of physics, let it be said that the subject matter of 
mathematics better lends itself to rigorous practices. A central point of this 
investigation has been one of questioning physics' introduction of too many 
counter-intuitive notions, which have been ranging from wave-function 
collapse, a priori single-system uncertainty, nonclassical statistics, all the 
way to particle-wave duality. With the sincerest of respect for services 
rendered, some of these enigmas are due for a reevaluation.
Since much explaining depends on reduction procedures through which 
new truths are related to older truths, such new truth is expected to be 
subject to the same restrictions as the old truth to which it has been 
reduced. Mathematicians are more skilled than many practitioners of other 
disciplines in specifying the conditions for which their results hold. They 
also are in a better position to do so. Yet, by the same token, as sticklers 
for precision, mathematicians frequently are the targets of scorn for 
"proving" things that seem perfectly obvious to others. Let the Jordan 
curve theorem be regarded as a case in point: it claims that a closed curve 
in two dimensions separates an inside and outside domain. A first reaction 
of the uninitiated is: but of course, this is obvious; what is there to prove?
Such premature convictions on the part of beginners rapidly evaporate 
as soon as they are confronted with the possibility of closed curves that 
don’t separate inner and outer domains. Examples are the azimuthally and 
meridionally closed curves on a torus surface; it is possible to get to either 
side without crossing those curves. They are cycles that don't have the 
separation properties of boundaries. After we have said "but of course," we 
realize the Jordan theorem’s importance for the topology of the two- 
dimensional configuration in which the closed curves have been embedded.
So, what first appeared as a pedantic exercise in futility suddenly 
manifests itself as a potential tool for topological exploration. This distinc­
tion between cycles and boundaries extends from one-dimensional curves 
in two dimensions to (n-1) cycles in n dimensions. This scheme (used in the 
previous chapters) is at the very heart of contemporary homology theory.
In other disciplines, it frequently happens that restrictions, say, compa­
rable to the just-mentioned topology contingencies, are not precisely known 
or cannot be precisely known. It is not always possible to decide whether 
certain restrictions are due to our lack of perceptiveness, or caused by nat­
ural limitations. After all, lack of perceptiveness is by itself a very natural 
limitation. What is meant here is that even if the final statements of a physi­
cal theory appear in an austere and purely mathematical form (the 
mathematical limitations of which are precisely known) it can still be true 
that, notwithstanding this mathematical precision, the physical limitations 
can still remain totally obscure.

226
CHAPTER XIV
In the light of discussions in preceding chapters, the Schroedinger 
equation of quantum mechanics is recognized as a case in point; its realm of 
applicability is quite unclear and not agreed upon by all afficionados of that 
discipline. Yet, the very precise mathematical language in which quantum 
mechanics has been cast has made it tempting for some to elevate also the 
physical implications of its results to a level of axiomatic impeccability, 
that are normally reserved for results in pure mathematics. The risk in 
making such extrapolations may be acceptable, if caution prevails in the 
extrapolation process. Experience is here the best teacher in calling the 
alert when to distrust and reexamine given results.
While topological probing of physical configurations may start with 
some well-defined topological concepts, their standard realm of 
mathematical realization is restricted to abstract geometry. Boundaries as 
domain separators in geometry are abstractions that can be introduced at 
will. The epistemological distinctions between mathematics and physics 
becomes here quite unambiguous. Whereas, in mathematics, topological 
structure can be created at will, in physics, it is necessary to make 
physically relevant identifications for domain separation. These identifica­
tions go to the heart of that what creates the physical manifestations with 
which we are concerned.
So the art of explaining is very much contingent on taking cognizance 
of one's audience realm of familiarity. Applied to a Schroedinger-based 
quantum mechanics, in which mathematical and physical epistemology are 
intertwined beyond recognition, a delineation has become next to im­
possible. Let us, therefore, briefly recall physical identifications made in 
the preceding chapters for the sole purpose of getting a better feel for 
topologically assessing physical structures.
2. Elementary Charge and Weak Interaction
An important topology contact in physics comes about through the 
cohomology connection. The differential 1,2 and 3 forms of physics are 
assessed according to whether they are closed or exact. The homology 
connection comes about as a result of selecting integration domains for 
these differential forms. A striking example of an homology choice is the 
trefoil-shaped electron to secure a 4k integral loop for the Aharonov- 
Bohm flux integral.
Choice of differential forms, their properties, and integration domains 
identify steps leading from mathematics to physics. In the process of doing 
so, we home in more and more on what may be called the "substance" or 
"substances" that generate the physics we perceive. The unavoidable yet 
age-old question being asked here: what is the nature of matter?
At the beginning of this century, matter had already become reduced to 
atoms that could be visualized, if you will, as miniature planetary systems 

OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
227
of electrically charged particles interacting through Coulomb's law instead 
of Newton's gravity. The next phase of experimental and theoretical 
research then homed in on the nature of the particles themselves. While 
the nature of the atom had been successfully reduced to smaller entities, the 
process of reduction for these smaller entities, known as elementary 
particles, presented some fundamental hurdles. Is it reasonable to keep 
subdividing ad libitum?
While the quarks and gluons of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) 
proved useful as reduction entities in interrelating properties of larger 
compound objects, these entities are found to violate the spirit of explana­
tion by not reducing to something observable or already familiar. Attempts 
at experimentally isolating and identifying quarks and gluons have 
remained unsuccessful. Yet many experiments have been very suggestive 
of the relevance of the quark concept as a descriptional tool. It then 
becomes, in the sense of Riordan 1 a matter of definition of reality whether 
or not this relevance should be accepted as proof of quark existence.
The smaller entities that make up atoms, such as electrons, protons, 
ce-particles etc., had, at the time, already manifested themselves in experi­
ments permitting an isolation and individual evaluation. Here, the beloved 
process of explaining by reduction to something already familiar worked 
fine, yet it comes to a grinding halt in assessing subatomic entities. The 
item of reduction simply refuses to make itself known for the purpose of 
becoming better acquainted. At this juncture, the process of reduction 
fails. The ensuing alternative is either to elevate the quark as a legitimate 
object of familiarity to justify reduction, as is presently done, or to 
consider the possibility that the situation still permits a different less radical 
path of reduction. Let us consider the latter option.
A quantum cohomological assessment of subatomic matter may be 
regarded as a process which attempts more of a reduction to familiar 
concepts. Yet the procedure is contingent on a postulated extended applica­
bility of certain differential forms of physics in the subatomic domain. 
Since a judicious extension to micro-applicability of existing laws (based on 
proven metric-independence) is less radical than introducing the brand new 
concepts such as quarks and gluons, let us argue in support of a balance 
between radically new and not so radically new.
Quantum uncertainty of single particles has been a stumbling block 
standing in the way of such cohomological procedures. Earlier discussions 
of the properties of the electron in chapters VIII, IX, and XI have revealed 
that a subatomic physical reality of the 3-form of charge is bound to have a 
major role in rendering services for the development of ideas about the 
substance and nature of subatomic physical obstruction.

228
CHAPTER XIV
The association of charge with an exact 3-form in spacetime is related to 
its property of playing the role of a boundary separating inner and outer 
domains. Faraday cage and Meissner effects are macro examples of 
charge's role as a field separator in three-dimensional physical space. In 
spacetime, charge would have to be a closed hypersurface and since a 
closed three-dimensional cycle can only be embedded in four dimensions, 
the inherent dynamic nature of elementary charge must be regarded as an 
inescapable conclusion.
It then follows from this essential dynamics of charge that all 
elementary charge must have simultaneous magnetic, as well as electric 
field manifestations. Yet, charged pions testify to the fact that not all 
elementary charge has an observable magnetic-field manifestation. When 
speaking in the electromagnetic vein, this fact can be reconciled for the 
pion if the magnetic flux is taken to be internally closed, without displaying 
an externally observable dipole moment. A qualitative measure for the 
ratio of meridional and azimuthal radii of a ring charge in azimuthal mo­
tion is, according to Eq.22 of chapter XI, of the order of the fine-structure 
constant ex.
A transition from azimuthal to meridional current, while retaining c as 
dictated by lightcone intersection, would increase the meridional current by 
a factor of the order For a conserved flux unit h/e, and the energy 
being almost purely magnetic, the associated pion mass would have to be of 
order ce-1. The pion-electron mass ratio is, in fact, of the order 2a-1.
These are, of course, highly speculative considerations. They are 
presented for the sake of argument, to show that a reduction of particle 
structure to classical and semiclassical concepts should not be prematurely 
discarded. They are, if you will, a follow-up on the considerations 
concerning electron structure given in chapter XL
Seen from this angle of internal and external flux, weak interaction 
decay resembles an internally trapped pion flux seeking an exterior 
magnetic moment manifestation. Yet, where does the excess energy go, 
and how do we account for spin and lepton number conservation? All of 
this brings us to Pauli's neutrino to account for an energy, charge, flux and 
angular-momentum balance.
3. Neutrinos as Manifestations of Electroflux
The transformation of an enclosed magnetic flux into a flux with an 
externally observable magnetic moment must be expected to invoke the 
induction of an electro-flux Jd t jE-dL in the sense of Faraday's law. It is 
now tempting to associate the neutrino with a manifestation of electro-flux. 
Electro-flux has the dimension (h/e) and, as shown by the Josephson effect, 
is seemingly quantized in units of that dimension, (chapter VIII).

OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
229
Neutrinos and anti-neutrinos would thus correspond to exchanges of 
magnetic flux and electro-flux. Conservation of lepton number can then be 
tentatively thought of as relating to this exchange between internal and 
external fluxes, with an electro-flux of appropriate sign in the balance for 
flux conservation.
Since, according to Eq. 15 of chapter VI, flux and angular momentum 
behavior are interrelated by virtue of the integrand's dependence on the 1- 
form R, we need to look at spin angular momentum behavior in 
conjunction with flux behavior. Spin and angular momentum have the 
same dimension as action, yet action is a scalar, whereas spin and angular 
momentum are not. Spin and angular momentum assume a scalar character 
of action after integration over relevant angle variables.
The following picture now transpires. Action can, in part, be regarded 
as integrated spin or angular momentum. Not all action is necessarily of 
that nature. There is a conservation of angular momentum and spin. There 
is not, in general, a conservation of total action.
Since action is a 4-form L over the top of the spacetime dimension, its 
local exterior derivative trivially vanishes and integration over "all" 
conceivable 4-cycles has meaning only if the universe of spacetime can be 
considered to be closed. In this sense, conservation of action could, at best, 
have a global meaning as a statement for the universe as a whole. This 
global statement is without a local counterpart, because the exterior 
derivative of the 4-form L vanishes identically, without making locally a 
physically meaningful conservation statement.
If, however, the 4-form of action (Eq. 18, chapter VI) is a pure diver­
gence, an application of Stokes' theorem reveals that the action in a given 
domain of spacetime is then given by a cyclic integral that contains this 
domain of spacetime. In that case, all action changes in that domain are 
determined by what goes through its three-dimensional boundary.
If the Lagrangian density is not a pure divergence (i.e., not the exterior 
derivative of a 3-form), action creation and annihilation can take place in 
the given domain of spacetime itself. The angular momentum-spin 
component of action can be conserved, wherever it derives from a 3-form 
according to Eq. 18 of chapter VI.
Similarly, as different kinds of action can be distinguished, so can 
different kinds of flux. Unlike action, flux conservation, involving 
magnetic and electro-flux, has a local and global meaning. While magnetic 
and electro-flux are not individually conserved, they can have an invariant 
association with specific particles (e.g., the electron and external magnetic 
flux, the neutrino and electro-flux).
Particle-associated magnetic flux can be subdivided again in enclosed 
internal flux without magnetic moment manifestation, such as may be the 

230
CHAPTER XIV
case for the pion, or an external flux, as in the case of electron and muon. 
While not all flux has a magnetic moment, a magnetic moment always has 
an associated flux. In the weak interaction process of pion decay, internal 
magnetic flux presumably trades places with external electron or muon 
flux. To identify the particle nature associated with the resulting electro­
flux in the balance, the spin structure of the objects under consideration 
have to be taken into account.
For configurations without spin, changes in magnetic flux states result, 
according to Faraday's induction law, in an equivalent opposite change of 
electro-flux fTdtJ E-dl, which, in principle, relates to a photon of 
electromagnetic interaction.
The weak interactions though don't emit photons; they instead emit or 
absorb neutrinos. If it is valid to consider these matters in an electromag­
netic context, the question is: what determines the difference between 
photon and neutrino exchange?
In the here-assumed perspective, the Faraday law should also remain 
intact for spin situations. Neutrino emission should then relate to the self­
knotting of the associated emitting structure. It then stands to reason that 
the topology of integration path Ci of the flux integral should be able to 
testify about these matters: a 2k path q relates to a photon, a 4k path Cj, 
by contrast, relates to a neutrino.* In other words: different and mutually 
exclusive mechanisms of Faraday induction are taken to be responsible for 
photon versus neutrino exchange. Table III summarizes the situation. 
The, perhaps, naive rationale underlying this premise is based on the 
consideration that the single loop has a center of symmetry, whereas the 
knotted loop has not!
It may also be useful to construct a similar overview of the action 
components generated by the Lagrangian 4-form L. The classification of 
action situations dictated by integrals of the 4-form L differs from the 
classification of the 2-form F in one very important respect. The F is a 
totally metric-independent structure, the L by contrast depends on the 
metric. Hence, along with the 3-form C as creator of topology, one must
The idea of knotting in relation to elementary particle structure has been pioneered by the late 
Herbert Jehle (Phys.Rev.Dll,2147(1975)). During a conversation I had with Jehle in the early seventies, 
we discussed the possible flux states of electron and muon. When I suggested the muon might be a higher 
flux state of the electron, his reaction indicated disagreement. While I do not remember him qualifying his 
point of view at the time, later I realized a higher flux state would be incompatible with the anomalous 
moment calculations for the muon given in chapters VIII and IX.

Table IV gives a possible classification for L. It is not quite clear, though, 
how the space versus time distinction of metric structure relates to the 
more subtle torsion distinction and the nonmetric principal blades decom­
position of the Maxwell field tensor, to be discussed later in this section.

232
CHAPTER XIV
An inspection of the combined Tables II, III and IV gives a preliminary 
idea how the 3-form of charge and the lightcone together could be instru­
mental in a topology-based classification of elementary particles. It is by 
no means an automatic "turn the crank" procedure. The potential in­
teraction with physical reality is, however, sufficiently compelling to ask 
new questions which could complement some of the more formal existing 
descriptions.
We now get a little closer to questions as to why some configurations 
emit photons, and others emit neutrinos. To go a step further, it is 
important to distinguish between different types of spacetime periodicity.
In nature, the most frequently encountered notions of periodicity are the 
spatial periodicity of waves and the purely spatial periodicity of crystal 
lattices for example. These observations on spatial periodicity invite an 
inquiry into the subject of pure-time periodicities. There are many macro- 
and microphysical examples of those in nature, yet our reluctance to get 
into subatomic modelling has left the elementary particle option largely 
unused as a candidate for pure-time periodicity.
For the trefoil electron model with circulating charge, the period 
= h / m c 2 is easily identifiable as charge circulation, because the 
predominantly magnetic nature of the electron permits us to write for its 
energy h/'t = 4>J; with <t> = h/e, it follows J = e/x. The latter identifies a 
physical meaning of X.
As reflected in the notion of "matter waves," a dominant paradigm of 
physical thinking has been one that all periodicity implies waves. Since we 
would not say that an atomic or molecular lattice implies waves, neither 
should we claim that every atomic or subatomic time periodicity implies 
waves.
It is quite another thing if, for mathematical purposes, say, a lattice is 
represented as a standing "Fourier wave." For die standing wave, spatial 
periodicity A and time periodicity T have been separated as independent 
epistemological entities. There is not a necessary implication that they are 
physically tied together by a velocity of propagation u=A/r, which is 
characteristic of some sort of a dynamic medium.
Crucial for recognizing waves is the occurrence of an interrelated 
spacetime periodicity as characteristic. Spatial periodicity and time 
periodicity, each taken as isolated physical facts, can have independent 
physical meanings without implying a wave existence. For their 
mathematical description, this raises the crucial question as to whether 
these separate epistemological manifestations of spacetime wave versus 
space periodicity and time periodicity can be recognized as meaningful 
invariant characterizations.

OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
233
For the spacetime wave, the spacetime phase invoking the four-vector 
(oo,k) is the most conspicuous invariant attribute. The Bohr-Sommerfeld 
integral carries a related semi-invariant connotation for periodic orbits 
invoking the energy-momentum vector (E,p), except that we conveniently 
leave out the E part. The time periodicity is here viewed as due to an 
orbital periodicity not a wave periodicity. In chapter VI (Eq.7), the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld integral was shown to be derivable from the Aharonov-Bohm 
integral, illustrating an interchange between orbital and time periodicity. In 
this transition from Aharonov-Bohm to Bohr-Sommerfeld, the spatial part 
A of the vector potential is conveniently inactive, which is not quite true 
anymore in relativity.
An understanding of these convenient expediencies, which are so 
characteristic and sometimes so very necessary for the developments of 
physics, is contingent on the invariant characterization of the space and 
time features of spacetime. The invariance of the spacetime signature under 
real spacetime substitutions is, so far, the best we have, provided this 
distinction has not already been obliterated by a geometric overzealousness, 
which is reflected in the notorious substitution u=ctV-L Let us see how the 
space versus time distinction manifests itself invariantly in the metric­
independent context of a Maxwell field.
Consider the Maxwell field, which for the sake of familiarity is here 
expressed in its "cartesian" components, although we keep in mind that its 
rank is a general metric-independent invariant:
f O Ex 
-Ex O 
-Ey -Bz 
l-EZ By
Ey M 
Bz -By I 
O Bx 
-Bx O .
The principal blades theorem for skew symmetric matrices claims that a 
real spacetime transformation always can be found transforming this 
matrix into a skew symmetric diagonalized form:
0 
-Ex 
O 
0
Ex O 01 
O O O > 
O 0 Bx 
O -Bx O,
For the Pfaffian stability condition E*B=O, the matrix has rank 2, hence 
only one of the diagonal 2 by 2 submatrices can be of rank 2, which leaves 
either an exclusive magnetic or an exclusive electric manifestation.

234
CHAPTER XIV
While this diagonal reduction had no relation to the metric, let us now 
diagonalize these 2 by 2 submatrices with respect to the metric .The electric 
part gives the real characteristic values:
A)j2 = ±Ex/c 
(the electric option).
The magnetic part yields purely imaginary characteristic values:
A] 2 = ±i Bx , with i=vf-i 
(the magnetic option).
In other words, when F is examined in the perspective of a spacetime 
metric structure, it reveals an invariant distinction between magnetic and 
electric features. Under real spacetime transformations, the electric part 
can be diagonalized; the magnetic part cannot! This distinction relates to 
the essentially 2-dimensional "blade" structure of magnetism versus the 
"arrowed" physical nature of the electric field. Note also how the two dis­
tinct real roots for the electric field component reveal two physically 
distinct manifestations.
For elementary particles, the real characteristic values of the electric 
option can be taken to reflect a pairing without an explicit reference to 
electric charge. Neutrino pairing is a possible candidate that could be taken 
as a manifestation of this primary distinction.
Magnetic flux, by contrast, does not manifest pairing, when taken all by 
itself; here, pairing becomes manifest only in conjunction with the charge 
and current generating the flux.
In general, since e-b = o places the object under consideration on a 
worldline living out its natural stable life, the characteristic roots of the 
Maxwellian field are given by A = + a/e2/c2-B2 = Vl- The sign and values 
of L, as stipulated in Table II give: L>0 two neutrinos; L<0 magnetic flux, 
pion internal, electron, muon external; L=0 photon.___________________
The characteristic root possibilities for the rank-2 Maxwellian field are 
instrumental for complementing the cohomological particle classification of 
chapter XIII. It reveals a potential feature of distinct elementary structures: 
i.e., 2 real roots for the neutrinos, a zero root for the photon, and a 
complex root for a dominant magnetic flux manifestation (e.g., external 
for electron and muon, with an internal option for the pion).
4. Conclusion
There is neither claim nor warranty that the given arguments permit a 
complete and unambiguous reduction of elementary particle structure to 
known or partly-extended forms of known laws of nature. The prelimi­
nary picture here obtained presents; at best, a fair inducement for work to 
make the reduction to familiar devices more complete, or, in the worst 
case, to discard it as unsatisfactory. Either way, this process of reduction 

OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
235
to familiar old concepts is bound to give new information and perspectives 
about the realm of validity of those older devices.
Even if the procedure is not more than merely a mnemonic device, it 
serves as a useful counterweight against a too-liberal creation of imagined 
building blocks, which later have a suspicious preference for remaining 
experimentally incognito.
Approaching the end of this odyssey in the land of explanation simply 
confirms that science continually vacillates between methods of reduction 
and innovation. When confronted with the world of observation, most of 
us first attempt to reduce seemingly new facts of observation to something 
already known. If, and only if, this process of reduction fails to give 
satisfaction, should we be prepared to go the path of innovation outside the 
realm of known things. It means injecting fundamentally new principles 
concerning ideas that have not been around before. More cautiously, we 
should perhaps say: ideas that may have been around before, but not in the 
framework of a newly given context of reality.
With apologies for citing an already much used example in this 
reprogramming endeavor, the reader is invited to consider once more the 
case of metric-independence. The awareness of metric-independent laws of 
physics, which has been around since the early Twenties, acquires an 
entirely new physical perspective when it is related to the premise of 
simultaneous macro- and micro-applicability. Metric-free period integrals 
don't a priori discriminate between macro- and micro-sized residues. Only 
shrinkability of integration domains, by permissible deformation, gives 
qualitative information of size. Finally, metric-independence is a sine qua 
non for the counting of identical objects.
Seen in this perspective of metric-free, the quality of science becomes 
enhanced by optimizing the balance between logical reduction to familiar 
concepts, on the one hand, and innovation, on the other. Science that never 
steps outside a preordained realm of logical reduction is in danger of losing 
momentum, notwithstanding the inherent beauty of some of its logical 
endeavors. On the other hand, science thriving solely on innovation, 
without adequate cross-checks of logical interconnections, runs the risk of 
going out of control.
Innovation that summarily requires a suspension of criteria of observa­
tion and logic is treading dangerous territory. The Copenhagen view of 
quantum mechanics is dangerously close to fitting this mold. It limits ob­
servability through innovation of a priori uncertainty and replaces the logic 
of causal inference by new rules, tentatively referred to as quantum logic.
It goes without saying in detailed specifics that whatever applies to a 
Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics is bound to affect disciplines that 
have been erected using those same premises (e.g., QED, QCD and perhaps 
Strings). Even if it threatens to become boring, it is necessary to reiterate 

236
CHAPTER XIV
those contingencies, because they reflect decades of established patterns of 
thought. While these descriptions have been erected to have definite mea­
sures of physical relevance, the physical identifications of some of their 
innovative creations, instrumental for their implementation, have remained 
elusive. There is a good chance they may remain so forever (e.g., the en­
ergy infinities of QED, the quarks, magnetic charge of QCD, the excess 
dimensions of Strings).
Confronted with these measures of reality, questions arise about the 
virtues of those innovations. Then, going back in time, we find that most 
of this, if not all, was precipitated by the early dispute between Copenhagen 
and the lonely proponents of an ensemble point of view in quantum 
mechanics.
If the ensemble point of view is so much more reasonable than the 
Copenhagen interpretation, how was it possible that a vast majority of the 
physics community has supported Copenhagen and still continues building 
new theories on its premises? It would be understandable if the ensemble 
point of view had received support only from obscure sources that deserve 
to be viewed with great suspicion. The truth is, however, that an examina­
tion of Jammer's^ book on the philosophy of quantum mechanics reveals 
names of very reputable proponents of the ensemble view. In the realm of 
textbooks, there have been respectable publications. All of this, ironically, 
suggests a near irrelevance of interpretation when it come to using 
quantum mechanics.
There are multiple articles and essays extolling the virtues of an 
ensemble view. Combing the contents of Jammer's treatise, one also finds 
names of people whose very reputation has been questioned, solely because 
they supported an unpopular point of view. Is it possible to come up with a 
consensus as to what, in particular, has dissuaded the majority from giving 
the ensemble a better chance?
Without consulting all the sources that perhaps should have been con­
sulted, I am inclined to come up with a two-pronged conclusion. Unlike 
the Copenhagen trio (Bohr, Bom, and Heisenberg), ensemble proponents 
never made a convincing plea as to how their ensemble could be physically 
specified, and what, in particular, in the ensemble had to be regarded as 
subject to statistics.
There are many clever investigations homing in on a conclusion that the 
statistics implied by the Schroedinger wave-function should be "classical" 
in nature. They unwittingly support Planck,3 who, in 1913, had given an 
early indication how phase randomness of ensemble constituents could be 
regarded as a conceivable source of zero-point energy and associated 
uncertainty. The 1925-1927 revolutionaries, with the exception of few, 
were so enraptured by the possibilities of their own new tools, that they 

OPTIMIZING REDUCTION TO FAMILIAR CONCEPTS
237
were little inclined to give the father of the quantum of action the 
consideration he so amply deserved. From that point on, many potential 
supporters of the ensemble point of view were swept off their feet by the 
mystique of the subsequent Copenhagen developments.
Life is perhaps unbearable without mystique. Science would be dull and 
stale without it. Mystique is essential for the growth of science, provided 
some of it resolves itself later, possibly to be replaced by new and deeper 
mysticisms. Mystique is a phase in the process of understanding, because it 
is essential in fetching human attention. Yet, mystique is an inducement not 
a goal for better understanding.
However, in the past half-century, none of the old quantum mysticisms 
have resolved themselves. The changes have been minimal. Physics still 
preaches the same wave-particle duality, ignoring the possibility that not all 
periodicity has to be of wave origin. Physics still wants to have its cake 
and eat it, too, by having wave-function collapse in the process of salvaging 
causality. Last, but not least, physics still accepts a point-presence for par­
ticles which have mass, charge, spin and magnetic moment. How has the 
formalism responded to this amazing collection of contradictions?
The formalism has responded by being forgiving. It substitutes for a 
point-particle a finite spatial presence by subjecting the point to uncer­
tainty, thus creating an equivalent domain space that would have been 
occupied by a finite particle. Somehow, the quantum formalism knows 
more than we; it kindly covers up for our interpretational transgressions.
Yet, even if we are privileged in having a user-friendly formalism at 
our disposal, the standard objective of science is to find out why nature 
does what it does. Instead, modem science attempts to learn why a for­
malism does what it does. The situation depicts an unusual shift in who is 
holding the initiative.____________________________________________
In science, one expects man to be in charge leading the formalism he 
has created. In quantum mechanics, the formalism has been leading man.
Nobody knew better than Schroedinger himself that we had to know 
more about his "gift from heaven" if we were to become responsible users, 
lest we find ourselves in the not-so-enviable position of the sorcerer's 
apprentice who did not know how to undo the avalanche unleashed by his 
magic words. Schroedinger eloquently verbalized his opinions about this. 
His observations, though, were of little avail!
Is there anything that presently can be done in easing the predicament of 
the many contemporary apprentice magicians? In the spirit of considera­
tions, cited in this monograph, we might ease up a little in trying out new 
magic words. We might listen more to some of the counsel of wise men 
like Einstein, Planck, Popper, and several others, who, many years ago, 
gave the ensemble the consideration it logically deserves. At this time, the 
ensemble evidence they gathered can be augmented to build a case that logi­

238
CHAPTER XIV
cally supersedes, by far, the quality of argument that can be used in support 
of Copenhagen views.
If an opinion poll were taken as to what the Copenhagen interpretation 
means to whom, one would get many different answers. The reason is that 
the Copenhagen interpretation really emerged as a work compromise. 
Different people accept compromises for reasons that are different, 
according to their personal relation to the compromise.
Only recently has it been possible to be more precise about the ensem­
ble option. It shows more clearly the limitations of the Schroedinger for­
malism in that it should be restricted to ensembles of random phase and 
orientation. Ironically, prior to the 1925 revolution, Planck pioneered ex­
actly such ensembles in his investigations of the zero-point energy.
What is the moral of physics' reluctance to acknowledge those earlier 
results of one of the immortals of contemporary research? Perhaps, taking 
cognizance of Planck's own reluctance to introduce new ideas might help. 
Physics truly needs fewer fundamentally new ideas that cannot be reduced 
to what we already have. There are reasons to consider quantum uncer­
tainty as a zero-point energy associated with a state of primordial ensemble 
disorder, not as an a priori attribute of any single system. Are uncertainty, 
zero-point energy and Zitterbewegung all necessary? or are they more of 
the same? We need to call more sparingly on fundamental innovations.
Planck's [very reluctant] introduction of a quantum of action emerges as 
one of the truly irreducible fundamental propositions of quantum theory. 
Perhaps the later discovery of E = me2, in conjunction with the atomicity of 
matter, could have given an inkling of energy atomicity.
Copenhagen's earlier glory is action's identification as a residue of 
a period integral by Bohr, later extended by Epstein, Sommerfeld and 
Wilson. Kiehn's recasting of this line integral in H-J space into a 
3-dimensional field integral opens up new perspectives for finite particles 
with topological structure. This 3-form integral is a field analogue 
interrelating quanta of electricity, flux, and action. The fairly recent 
discovery of the quantum of flux by Deaver-Fairbank and Doll-Naebauer, 
and its representation in terms of a residue integral by Aharonov, Bohm 
and London further supplements a picture of identifying fundamental 
physical quanta as building blocks of physical theory.
In the light of such experimental testimony, it would be sinful neglect 
not to try out de Rham's period integral methods as a major tool in the 
exploration of topological physical structure in space and time. These tools 
are already used in ad hoc fashion; it is now time to recognize the need for 
their more organized integrated use, unhampered by nonclassical myth.

CHAPTER XV
COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
1. Summary
The objective of this chapter is to gather evidence that the long-abided 
reconciliation of quantum laws and relativity is met by the period integral 
recipes of quantization. This compatibility, then, automatically extends to 
any quantum cohomology based on those period integral laws. Some of the 
obstacles that stood in the way of such a reconciliation are here identified. 
It is primarily the unsubstantiated expectation that Schroedinger's equation 
and its Dirac relativistic version had to be viewed as intermediate steps on 
the road to an encompassing quantum theory meeting the requirements of 
the general theory of relativity. By restoring the ensemble as their object 
of description, the wave equations of quantum mechanics become released 
from the unreasonable imposition of having to satisfy the principle of 
general covariance. The treatment of single systems is, by contrast, based 
on the restoration of generally invariant integral laws of physics. They can 
be adapted to serve as period integrals in the sense of a de Rham-type coho­
mology for assessing topology. Since Diffeo-4 invariance is a prerequisite 
for assuming the role of spacetime topological probe, compatibility of these 
integrals with the principle of general covariance is now no longer a 
problem. The presented investigation compares mathematical-physical 
techniques. Since notations in this overworked area of physics easily call 
up unwanted associations, language, rather than formalism, is given 
priority to delineate fundamentals.
2. Introduction
An inspection of physics literature over the last six decades reveals a re­
currence of so-called "difficulties" associated with the conceptual 
compatibility of two principal disciplines: quantum mechanics and the gen­
eral theory of relativity. The references tend to be somewhat tongue in 
cheek, because rarely does one find major foundational investigations de­
voted to the subject of their compatibility. In the familiar Dirac equations, 
there is already a measure of successful blending of quantum mechanics
240

COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
241
and the special theory of relativity. The general theory of relativity, how­
ever, has placed obstacles on the path of a more complete conceptual unity.
The objective is to explore the mathematical-physical nature of these 
difficulties. The conclusion obtained from those explorations is a radical 
one. No compatibility can be expected, as long as we keep adhering to the 
Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics. It is specifically the Copenhagen 
dictum of a function which is said to be the probability amplitude 
indicative for single-particle position and momentum. This single particle 
is then given a physical presence equivalent to a mathematical point sin­
gularity. An ever-present Heisenberg uncertainty subsequently reinstates 
for this point-object a de facto finite physical presence.
A substitution of this Copenhagen view with that of the statistical en­
semble interpretation, such as advocated by Einstein,! Popper^ and many 
others,3 takes away the need for having to seek a general relativistic 
version of what is commonly referred to as a quantum mechanical-wave 
equation. Seen in this context, the compatibility demand loses its relevance. 
From the ensemble point of view, the standard tools of contemporary 
quantum mechanics are no longer under the unreasonable obligation of 
having to provide a final and unequivocal answer to all microphysical 
fundamental situations.
In the light of the ensemble interpretation, quantum mechanics has to be 
denied the Copenhagen-permitted formal applicability to truly isolated 
single systems that are not part of an ensemble. Even if such applications 
have been known to yield meaningful answers, their relevance is to be 
taken in an asymptotic sense. Ensemble properties undoubtedly are gov­
erned by the individual properties of their constituents as isolated systems. 
On this basis one would expect an asymptotics of the properties of the en­
semble and its constituents. This asymptotics, however, does not justify the 
Copenhagen extrapolation, which claims that quantum mechanics, as is, 
covers the single system.
Once it is agreed that the contemporary tools of quantum mechanics are 
instruments of ensemble description, a compatibility of these tools, with the 
dictates of the general theory, needs to be identified as a pursuit without a 
clearly defined objective. Instead, we ought to be looking for the truly 
more fundamental tools that are applicable to isolated single-quantum sys­
tems. The latter are now no longer excluded from exploration by a misin­
terpretation of quantum uncertainty, such as ensues from the standard tools 
when viewed in the Copenhagen perspective. In recent times, the excessive 
difficulties encountered in applying wave equations to macroscopic quan­
tum phenomena, such as the quantum Hall effect, testify to the diminishing 
returns when ensemble tools are extrapolated to single macro systems.

242
CHAPTER XV
In the following, we first assess why contemporary quantum concepts 
don’t gibe well with the dictates of the general theory of relativity. We 
proceed to make a preliminary exploration of period integrals as tools that 
do indeed comply with the invariance prerequisites imposed in the context 
of the general theory. Then, after viewing the evidence linking the 
ensemble thesis with the use of the standard tools of quantum mechanics, 
the suitability of period integrals are examined as a substitute for dealing 
with single isolated systems, be it microscopic or macroscopic. Finally, 
after delineating the need for this two-pronged mathematical-physical 
picture of ensemble versus single system, an epistemological review of 
other evidence clinches the case against Copenhagen to desist from an 
unjustifiable identification of ensemble and single system. The Copenhagen 
interpretation thus emerges as, at best, a temporary work hypothesis 
retaining viability only as long as the ensemble single-system identification 
is asymptotically permissible.
3. General Theory of Relativity and Dirac Equation
A major hallmark of the Dirac equation is the near-automatic emer­
gence of the concept of spin. A mathematical equivalent to the Dirac con­
cept of spin had earlier been introduced by Cartan^ in his investigations of 
the group spaces of orientation preserving transformations. The seemingly 
arbitrary mathematical act of excluding orientation changing characteristics 
from a group was found to leave still a local reminder of a possible 
extension to orientation changing operations. Later, work by Haefliger,5 
Milnor^ and others have revealed how spin properties bear local testimony 
to global orientability structure of manifolds, and the geometry and topol­
ogy of the physical objects therein.
Seen from this more encompassing picture, "spinorization" not only is 
relevant to the orientation preserving rotation and Lorentz groups, it is 
also relevant to the orientation preserving real general linear group. The 
emergence of a group feature leading to the two-unit operations of orbit 
and spin 2rc and 4tc, is a direct consequence of the physically imposed 
restriction to real transformations.
It is an irony of fate that a condition of mathematical "reality" for the 
proper rotations leads to a two-dimensional spin representation replete with 
complex variables. Only in the case of the orthogonal group is it possible 
to find such a simple two-dimensional complex representation. Finding a 
representation for the spinorization of the general linear group (if possible 
at all) is more complicated. An assessment of a fundamental feature as spin, 
though, should not be contingent on such mathematical coincidence.
It follows, from this brief glance into the realm of group represen­
tations, that the spin formalism as quantum mechanics knows it, is rather

COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
243
coincidentally linked to the orthogonal orientation preserving groups in 
three and four dimensions. Yet, a hallmark of the general theory of 
relativity is the act of invoking an extension of the orthogonal invariance 
groups of physics to general real spacetime substitutions. This principle is 
known as "Einstein's principle of general covariance." Presently in the 
mathematical literature, this set of transformations is also referred to as a 
diffeomorphism (i.e., spacetime Diffeo-4).
Einstein's imposition of general covariance created an extended hierar­
chy of invariance principles in physical theory. It confronts us with an 
extended classification calling for an identification of physical quantities 
belonging in the general diffeomorphic category. Einstein's principle of 
general covariance thus demands scrutiny of the distinct physical roles of 
Diffeo-4, all the way down to the discrete subgroups of crystallography.
Soon after the introduction of the principle of general covariance, 
Kretschmann, and later, more forcefully, Bridgman,8 argued that the 
principle of general covariance could have no physical implications. 
Today, many texts on relativity pay rather unthinking lipservice to this 
point of view, without really attempting an independent assessment. It is 
said that Einstein conceded to Kretschmann. Yet a careful reading of the 
papers that triggered the controversy reveals how Einstein upheld the view 
that his principle was essential for the structure of spacetime physical 
theory. I do believe we owe the creator of the general theory, and the 
principle he claimed as instrumental for that theory, a token of respect by 
fully reporting his position!
Now, faced with Dirac’s magic of creating spin by blending quantum 
mechanics and the special theory of relativity, the late Twenties and the 
early Thirties had to lead, almost unavoidably, to a frantic search for also 
reconciling Dirac theory with the general theory of relativity. After 
Kretschmann had just succeeded in physically emasculating Einstein's 
principle of general covariance, one might well ask why?
Apparently not everybody shared the finality of the Kretschman- 
Bridgman verdict. Among those who gave the project of reconciling the 
brainchilds of Dirac and Einstein an all-out attempt were impressive names 
combining unique talent and expertise in physics and mathematics (e.g., 
Schroedinger,9 van der WaerdenJO and Einstein^ himself). Let us take a 
brief look at the formidable obstacles they encountered in the process of 
accomplishing their task.
Since the existing spinor formalism dictates the use of local orthogonal 
inertial frames, and since a Riemann space does not permit such frames to 
be extended over finite domains, one is faced with the alternative either of 
dropping the spinor formalism as is, or accepting a situation where the lo­
cal frames differ from spacetime point to spacetime point.

244
CHAPTER XV
Clearly, for a general relativistic transcription of the Dirac equations 
one has to accept the latter (i.e., the multiple frame solution). This proce­
dure is known as the method of anholonomic frames. For vectors and the 
like, it had already been spelled out by Ricci at the turn of the last century. 
The coefficients of transport recording the orientation changes between 
adjacent frames are known as "Ricci coefficients of rotation." They are the 
anholonomic counterparts of the holonomic Christoffel symbols that give 
the parallel displacement between adjacent points in the holonomic frames 
originally envisioned by Einstein. Spinors thus forced an anholonomic 
transcription of Einstein's GR theory.
To those not accustomed to dealing with such seemingly outlandish con­
cepts, let it be known that physicists have been using these concepts all 
along from the last century onwards. In three dimensions, the familiar 
procedure of "curvilinear coordinates" is based exactly on the same 
principles. When introducing polar or cylindrical coordinates, one locally 
erects orthogonal frames aligned with the coordinate directions. The 
procedure is used for transcribing the vector-differential operations of 
gradient, curl and divergence into noncartesian coordinates._____________
The Reference Alternative of Mathematical Physics
For comparison, keep in mind that the holonomic process of arbitrary 
references imposes the need to distinguish between a diversity of vector 
species, yet with a single differential operation (exterior derivative). By 
contrast, restriction to orthogonal anholonomic frames instead yields a di­
versity of differential operators (grads, curls and divergences), operating 
on the one and only vector species permitted by standard vector analysis.
In the present context, an interesting historical question is why 19th 
century physicists chose to use anholonomic references? The choice seems 
strange, because they did not have to worry about the spinors which had 
not yet been discovered? Contemporary textbooks reveal no clue as to the 
motivation for doing so. The anholonomic procedure is just given without 
asking questions about alternatives. An explanation is now necessary for 
later reference.
In the last century, and even today, many physical quantities say ve­
locity, momentum, electric field and magnetic field had been defined only 
with respect to orthogonal frames. Oblique frames made it necessary to 
distinguish between many more vector species, such as covariant and 
contravariant vectors, vector densities and last, but not least, polar vectors 
and axial vectors. 12 The choice had to do with decisions whether or not 
an essential physical purpose could be served with all those different vector 
species.
The wise men of that era opted for the seemingly simpler solution of 
retaining the one-vector species under the orthogonal group. The metric 

COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
245
field tensor in its diagonal form (1,1,1) could be used for mapping of the 
different species into a single species. Except for crystal physics, there 
were, at that time, few physical phenomena at the horizon opting for a 
plurality of vector species. In the general theory of relativity, the metric 
was, however, identified as a physically active field. The metric-based 
transcription between vector species could no longer be taken to be 
physically trivial. The new situation really called for a difference in the 
historically grown single-vector tradition; yet, somehow, it never led to a 
radical redrafting from scratch. That is where we were then, and still are 
today.
The general relativistic transcribers of the Dirac equations had no 
choice in the matter. Once again, they were forced into a confrontation 
with these decisions and difficulties of the past. The transcribers were 
forced to use anholonomic references, because spinors don't admit an 
holonomic process under Diffeo-4. On the other hand, the 19th century 
transcribers of classical physical methods to general coordinates did have a 
choice. They opted for anholonomic references as the simplest solution. 
The general theory of relativity was never a sufficiently integral part of 
physics to give holonomic alternatives a chance. In praise of tradition, let it 
be known that even the modem textbook's way of doing (general) relativity 
is now anholonomic.
What has become the upshot of the here-cited anholonomity blues of 
physics for the general relativistic transcription of the Dirac equation? 
Terrible complications! In fact, it may by now be said that these compli­
cated equations have not led to any new physical insights, except one: the 
transcriptions of the Dirac equations into a general-covariant garb were not 
based on a physically well-defined course of action. No useful purpose is 
served in reproducing here those complicated procedures.
It is not surprising that, the negative outcome of this endeavor had cast 
new dispersions on the viability of the principle of general covariance (i.e., 
over and above that which had already been said in the earlier critiques of 
Kretschmann and Bridgman). Contemporary workers in these fields rarely 
express opinions about these contradictory matters.
Let it suffice to cite here an observation made in the context of recon­
ciling relativity and quantum mechanics by Misner, Thome and Wheeler in 
their tome on gravity. 13 It may be quite representative of attitudes of many 
workers in this area: "Spacetime does not exist, except in a classical 
approximation." The authors' inner conflict about this subject matter 
becomes dramatically apparent, when in the same tome, de Rham'sl^ 
theorems of differential topology are discussed. Statement and theorem 
reflect a conflict of purpose. In the present volume, de Rham's options are 
pursued and extended well into the microscopic physical domain.

246
CHAPTER XV
4. 
The Physical Motivation for Diffeo-Extension
In a discussion about matters concerning the role of invariances in 
physics, I remember one participant who argued the physical irrelevance of 
the principle of general covariance, with the following remark: "If you set 
your mind to it, just about anything can be written in a general covariant 
manner." There is indeed an unfortunate truth in this observation, because 
it is reminiscent of an era when attempts were made to give a "general 
relativistic" formulation of almost everything under the sun. While the 
cited observation may be very effective in stopping mindless applications of 
invariance principles, by the same token it does not exactly contribute to a 
spirit of utilizing the powerful classification potential associated with an 
hierarchy of invariance groups and their subgroups.
Just from a purely mathematical point of view, one has to admit that 
integrability theory better be Diffeo-invariant to have any meaning at all. 
Hamilton-Jacobi theory, Poisson brackets and Pfaffian integrability are 
living testimonies proving an indispensable mathematical need for Diffeo 
invariance.
The physics of crystals illustrates a typical example of mathematical 
neglect. The point-group symmetries of crystals are known to number 32 
in total. They are all subgroups of the rotation group, including reflections 
and inversions. The pioneers of crystal physics in the last century had to 
extend the hierarchy of groups from orientation-preserving rotations to 
those permitting orientation changes. This group extension, and the asso­
ciated extension of the number of vector species (polar, axial), was abso­
lutely essential, because, without it, we would not have gained an 
understanding of many phenomena typical for crystals (e.g., piezo-elec­
tricity, enantiomorphism and others). Yet, the standard methods of 
mathematical communication in physics have remained quite unable to 
accommodate those polar-axial distinctions. At the time, they were 
introduced ad hoc, when needed; they still are today.
By extending the group description with the element of time-reversal 
symmetry, attempts have been made at classifying crystals with magnetic 
properties. However, if somebody now came along by calling for a 
"general relativistic" formulation of crystallography, the natural response 
truly ought to be: Let us not exaggerate!
The central question is: What could possibly be a physical motivation 
for a Diffeo-extension of the hierarchy of invariance groups? Since 
Kretschmann and Bridgman could not accept the general theory of relativ­
ity as a sufficient motivation for a Diffeo-4 extension of the group hierar­
chy, what other reason exists of which they, and perhaps also Einstein, 
were unaware? A comparison with crystal physics may again be helpful in 
elucidating the situation for spacetime.

Consider the study of EM waves in birefringent media. Standard pro­
cedure starts out with the Maxwell equations and the constitutive relations 
for the medium under consideration. The standard renditions of the 
Maxwell equations are invariant under the group of rotations R(3). The 
constitutive equations, on the other hand, are invariant only under the sym­
metry group of the medium under consideration, say, the dihedral group 
D(4,2) for a tetragonal crystal. There is no question that D(4,2) has to be a 
subgroup of R(3), because otherwise the Maxwell equations could prejudi­
cially affect the end result. Yet, we expect the Maxwell equations to be 
applicable to any crystal medium; for all 32 crystal point-groups to be 
subgroups of R(3), the orientation changes need to be joined to R(3). The 
tacit, not usually explicitly mentioned, condition is:
Principle of Invariance Hierarchy
The invariance group of the field equation (i.e., fundamental law) 
should be an overgroup of the constitutive symmetry groups to which the 
field equations are being applied.
Now, extending these consideration to EM wave propagation in matter- 
free space, can we apply the same principle? The answer is yes, but pre­
vailing traditions in physics have made it difficult. The first question here 
is: Where are the constitutive equations of matter-free space? Tradition has 
had it to build the free-space constitutive equations into the field equations 
themselves. The invariance group of the free-space equations was first 
believed to be the Lorentz group; later, through the work of 
Cunningham 15 and Bateman, 16 the free-space equations were found to be 
invariant under an overgroup of the Lorentz group, known as the 
"conformal spacetime group."
All this still leaves unanswered questions about the identification and 
whereabouts of the free-space constitutive equations. Presumably, the 
spacetime metric should have something to do with the free-space constitu­
tive equations, because the invariance of the metric defines the Lorentz 
group in the manner as introduced by Einstein. While the metric itself is 
not invariant under the conformal group, an algebraic concomitant of the 
metric is indeed invariant. This concomitant, together with a universal 
constant known as the impedance of free space, determines the free-space 
constitutive relations, which map the six vector F(E,B) into the six vector
These relations are conformally invariant.
What are the field equations that are to be combined with these free- 
space constitutive equations? Presumably, they have to be written in a man­
ner using all four field vectors E,B,H,D, such as is customary when using 

248
CHAPTER XV
the MKS system of units. The invariance group of these equations has to 
be either the conformal group or an overgroup thereof.
The next step invokes the dictates of the general theory of relativity. 
Due to spacetime curvature, the metric cannot be taken as constant in a 
finite domain of spacetime. A standard, though not universally recom­
mended, recipe of creating relativistically invariant equations, is by re­
placing partial derivatives by covariant derivatives. Unfortunately, covari­
ant derivatives invoke the metric through the Christoffel symbols. This act 
of creating general covariance contaminates the field equations with ele­
ments of constitutive description. How can this be avoided?
A functional separation of field- and constitutive-laws is possible if, and 
only if, the Maxwell equations can be rendered in a general covariant form 
without the help of covariant derivatives. In the Twenties, Kottlerl? and 
Cartan 18 discovered that such a metric-independent invariant form of the 
Maxwell equations indeed exists. Notwithstanding an independent and later 
rediscovery by van Dantzigl^ in the early Thirties, and an overview of 
these matters by Whittaker,20 as well as two monographs in English21 and 
one in German,22 textbooks published in the subsequent six decades have 
been repeating the same half-truths or falsehoods about this subject matter.
A popular half-truth is: Maxwell's equations are invariant under 
Lorentz transformations, but not under Galilei transformations. The truth 
is the metric independent rendition of the Maxwell equations is Lorentz- 
and Galilei-invariant, because both are subgroups ofDiffeo-4. The unified 
treatment of Micheson-Morley and Sagnac experiments in chapter XVIII 
testifies to the practical usefulness of a slightly wider conceptual horizon. 
The dominant neglect of mathematically precise language in physics has led 
to a bereavement of useful new perspectives. It should therefore not be 
surprising if reconciliation between relativity and quantum mechanics has 
not been forthcoming in an atmosphere of pragmatically reducing mathe­
matical perceptiveness.
Since detail of technical notation frequently triggers unwanted associa­
tions, let us verbally summarize the secret of the metric-independent gen­
erally covariant form of the Maxwell equations. Since standard textbook 
renditions of Maxwell theory are presented in a rotation invariant form, 
excluding reflections, the use of one-vector species suffices. Extending the 
invariance group creates new vector species; they reduce to one species, 
once the group is restricted to rotations. The Diffeo-4 invariance of the 
Maxwell equation is contingent on the physical identification of four spatial 
vector species.
Physics has been disinclined to differentiate between those vector 
species, because it involves decisions of physically identifying first the dis­
tinct Diffeo-3 vector species to be grouped together as two spacetime 

COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
249
Diffeo-4 six-vector species. Instead, physics consensus has opted to 
continue the one-vector gospel by erecting anholonomic local orthogonal 
inertial frames. This "Myth of Simplicity" is now backfiring, creating a 
hurdle in understanding the compatibility of two major disciplines.
While Whittaker was still undecided about the implications of these 
mathematical physical elaborations, Cartan probably came closest to a 
physical message by emphasizing the integral origin of the Maxwellian 
laws. The implied invariance of those integral statements then automati­
cally determines the transformation of those integrands as the four distinct 
Diffeo-3 and corresponding Diffeo-4 fields. Cartan, in his method, pre­
ferred to refer to the bilinear expression of field components and integra­
tion elements as differential forms, thus reducing undue preoccupation with 
the subjective choices of coordinates.
To cover the options demanded by physics, we need to distinguish be­
tween scalar-valued integrals and pseudo-scalar-valued integrals. The first 
are absolute invariants under arbitrary changes of coordinates; the second 
only change sign under orientation changes of coordinates. De Rham calls 
the differential forms associated with scalar-valued integrals "pair"; the 
others associated with pseudo scalars are called "impair." The assignment 
of pair and impair, when combined with the dimension of the integration 
domains of the integrals, gives an idea of the field species necessary in 
holonomic description.
There are already four distinct vector species needed to define the dif­
ferential forms for the generally invariant one- and two-dimensional 
scalar-valued integrals of standard Maxwell theory. The fields E and H 
relate to one-dimensional integrals, the first integral is pair (scalar-valued); 
the second integral is impair (pseudo-scalar-valued). The fields D and B 
relate to two-dimensional integrals, the first integral is impair and the 
second integral is pair. The one-dimensional integration element changes 
sign under spatial inversion, and the two-dimensional integration element 
does not; it follows that E and D are polar vectors and H and B are axial 
vectors, which, indeed, is the assignment demanded by crystal physics.
Without going through all the details of identification, it should be 
mentioned that de Rham's differential form assignment of pair and impair 
is in one-one correspondence with the vectorial and tensorial trans­
formation assignments given by Schouten. Since the Schouten-de Rham 
distinctions are absolutely necessary for coping with crystal physics, the 
latter-day prophets of modernizing mathematical communication in physics 
have, in their fervor of eliminating coordinates from physics, made the 
mistake of also leaving out de Rham's pair-impair distinction! Ironically, 
what was meant save work ends up causing more work. Unfortunately, to 
some, such developments have a sunny side; they provide material to 
propose funding for "new" research.

CHAPTER XV
The just-mentioned integrals of the differential forms of electro-dynam­
ics have been found to count quanta. They have been extensively discussed 
in the previous chapters. These facts were known long ago. For Gauss' law 
of electrostatics, it became apparent, early in the 19th century, through 
Faraday's discovery of discrete charge (his law of electrolytic solutions). 
This integral counts an algebraic sum of elementary quanta ±e of electric 
charge inside a closed surface of integration. An extension to include 
Ampere's law covers dynamic situations of cooperative motion of 
charge.23 Another example is the integral of Aharonov and Bohm.24 if 
its path of integration resides in a field-free domain, it is known to count 
units of flux. R.M. Kiehn25 has added to these one-and two-dimensional 
integral counting devices a three-dimensional device counting units of 
integrated spin and angular momentum.
Since counting quanta does not depend on choice of coordinates or units 
of measurement, those integrals exhibit metric-free Diffeo-4 invariance. 
In the absence of a metric, no references can be made to macro- or micro­
physics, thus indicating a potential macro and micro applicability of these 
integral laws.
An overview of these period integral methods is given in ref.26, and 
their applicability to a diversity of physical macro and micro situations is 
presented in ref.27 and in chapters VI-XL___________________________
Those who study the metric structure of the universe may be interested 
in the possibility that metric-free laws could, in principle, retain physical 
relevance even in domains of unusual metric behavior, such as are expected 
to be manifest in black holes.
5. 
The Diffeo Equivalent of Spinorization
In the sense of Haefliger^ and Milnor,6 spinors give local testimony to 
spacetime's global ability to accommodate spatial and spacetime enan­
tiomorphic objects. Analogous to the reference alternative of section 3, we 
may now consider a_____________________________________________
Spin-Orientability Alternative.
Recognizing spin as a local artifact for dealing with the structure of 
spacetime orientability and the enantiomorphic objects embedded therein, 
an appropriate use of Diffeo-4 global description should be able to replace 
the standard use of spin formalisms.________________________________
Hence, avoiding the hurdle of being tied down by a spin-restricted 
choice of local frames, the local description needs to be abandoned alto­
gether to make place, from the start, for a global description. The Diffeo-4 
invariant integrals of previous chapters and sections are ideally suited for 
global description. A subsequent point of concern is then finding field 

COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
251
configurations that have a potential of accounting for spacetime pairing 
such as is manifest in the enantiomorphism of charge-and spin-pairing.
The local image of point-electron is clearly no longer adequate; instead 
a ring-type configuration is needed, which accounts for pairing and mag­
netic moment. In chapters VIII and XI, the knotted ring configuration in 
space, also known as trefoil, was selected as having left and right modifica­
tions. Subsequent application of the cited period integrals to this trefoil 
configuration indeed accounts for many observed data associated with 
electron and muon pairs, including their half-integer spin and the first or­
der anomaly of their magnetic moments.27,28
The cited procedure gives a finite calculational alternative compared to 
standard QED calculations for point-electron and muon, which require the 
processing of calculational infinities. Also, a qualitative understanding of 
higher-order anomalies is possible; yet, for a quantitative evaluation of the 
higher-order terms, the QED process has an edge over the trefoil model.
Fundamental in the distinction between wave-equation approach and 
period-integral approach is the evolution from point-model to a finite 
model, with a specific topology. Unlike the metric-related predicament of 
Diffeo-4 invariance encountered with the wave-equation, the period 
integral procedure, by contrast, presents no problem. In fact, Diffeo-4 
invariance has emerged as essential to make those gains possible.
There is reluctance to accept spacetime on a Diffeo-4 basis. The unilat­
eral properties of time play a role in these inhibitions. It is, therefore, rele­
vant to draw attention to the little-known fact that so-called one-dimen­
sional topological torsion manifests itself for the first time when making 
the transition from three to four dimensions.29 Nature gives us perfect 
cyclic time in the form of stable elementary particles, and arrowed time 
through worldlines and entropy-related phenomena. Torsion aspects are 
discussed in chapters XII and XIII.
6. 
Conclusion
Looking back at the array of arguments which have been brought to 
bear on the compatibility between relativity and quantum mechanics, the 
most compelling one undoubtedly is that all those years, we have been 
addressing the wrong situation. The quantum mechanical wave equations 
have mistakenly been elevated to a fundamental position that could not be 
theirs.
The cause of this dubious assessment is a consequence of Copenhagen's 
failing to make adequate distinction between ensemble, and ensemble con­
stituent. While this omission was acceptable in the days of early develop­
ment, because of the asymptotics between ensemble and constituent, the 

252
CHAPTER XV
time has come either to prove this identification as a viable proposition, or 
to abandon the Copenhagen interpretation altogether.
In absence of a proof of viability, a farewell to Copenhagen views is 
now indicated, with thanks for the many services rendered. Much useful 
information was gained by pushing the methods just over the edge of 
applicability. In fact, a farewell to the Copenhagen of 1930 is, in part, a 
reinstatement of principles, which, a decade earlier, had also emerged in 
Copenhagen.
Today, textbooks on quantum mechanics provide details of solving the 
Schroedinger equation for the harmonic oscillator. It shows how this 
solution leads to an eigenvalue spectrum for the energy of (n+1/2)Pigo, 
with n=l,2,3.... replacing Planck's earlier spectral formula ntico, without
the 1/2. The spectrum without the 1/2 was said to be a relic of a theory of 
the past, referred to as incomplete and inadequate. The term 1/2 had been 
created by the magic of the Hermite polynomial solutions of the 
Schroedinger equation.
Yet, when it so magically appeared, the 1/2 term was rather immedi­
ately identified as a contribution due to an always-present zero-point 
energy. How did they know? The identification is usually made without 
much of an explicit rationale and so it is passed on from textbook to text­
book. The unsuspecting reader may well think that zero-point energy was 
first discovered with the help of Schroedinger's equation. Nothing is 
further from the truth, though, than this suggestion!
More than a decade prior to the emergence of the Schroedinger equa­
tion, Max Pl a nek 30 identified zero-point energy as a property that would 
be manifest in a phase-random ensemble of harmonic oscillators. He was 
guided to this conclusion by his rejection of negative probabilities.
Suffice it to say that Planck's derivation of zero-point energy was, of 
course, contingent on the assumption of energy states nhco for the indi­
vidual harmonic oscillators. Now we know how the textbook writers knew 
why the tiGo/Z had to be a zero-point energy. And so it was passed on 
from one to the other.
Although I have seen quite a few textbooks on quantum mechanics, I 
have not seen them all. Of the ones that I have seen, I remember hardly a 
single one referring to Planck for the idea of zero-point energy; much less 
do they refer to Planck's ensemble-based derivation thereof. All of this 
seems so contrary to the best science traditions. We need to ask how this 
distortion of history came to pass?
Had this distortion been intentional, it would have been an act of simple 
dishonesty. If it was unintentional, it should, perhaps, be referred to as 
"disingenuous." Whichever name applies, the fact of the matter is that a 

COMPATIBILITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY
253
younger generation has been so imbued with a nonclassical Catechism that 
the interest in why, and where it all came from, has simply subsided.
As proof that these omissions of referring to Planck were most likely 
made in good faith, consider that also the much fewer "ensemble authors" 
about quantinn mechanics have conspicuously failed to get Planck on their 
side. Also, any reference here to Planck's zero-point energy is, amazingly, 
missing. What more evidence do we need that, all those years, nonclassical 
dogma has prevailed over reason? Is contemporary quantum mechanics 
going the path of religious fundamentalism?
Here is one more example of failing to draw classical conclusion from 
a nonclassical predicament. The Schroedinger equation is known to lead to 
an angular momentum quantum number Vn(n+1), which for large n be­
comes n+1/2, thus suggesting a perhaps distant relation to the 1/2 of the 
zero-point energy. There are two textbooks^ ! ,32 that give a classical sta­
tistical derivation of the number Vn(n+T) by an evaluation of the average 
modulus of angular momentum for an ensemble of directionally random­
ized objects in angular momentum states nfi. Both texts present this 
derivation as a perhaps interesting mathematical oddity; they stop just short 
of considering the physical-ensemble option as an essential feature of the 
wave-equation approach. Why does their classical counter-example not rule 
out the nonclassical escape? or would the use of classical logic perhaps 
violate the premises of nonclassical procedures?
Mindful of the massive amount of physical research that is either di­
rectly or indirectly contingent on an explicit or an implicit use of a non­
classical Catechism of quantum mechanics, let us note that the time has 
come for a reconsideration of its epistemological foundations. Many con­
ferences have been devoted to this objective. The emphasis tends to be 
more on what is new now and less so on what was. Since the here- 
presented thoughts relate so closely to the work of Einstein and Planck 
both, it seems fitting to cite Einstein in a tribute to Planck:
....."Some men come to the temple of science, because it offers oppor­
tunity to display their particular talents. Science is a sport in which they 
excel. Others come to the temple offering their contribution in the hope of 
profitable return. These men are scientists by circumstance; the opportu­
nity that happened to present itself when making their choice of a career. 
Had the attending circumstances been different, they might have become 
politicians or captains of business. Should God's angel descend from 
heaven and drive from the temple those who belong to those categories, I 
fear the temple would be an emptier place. Few worshippers would re­
main, some from days gone by and some from our generation. Our Planck 
belongs to the latter, and that is why we love him." 
(translation)

CHAPTER XV
These words give heartwarming testimony as to how charisma and 
professional excellence can go together. Those who know the 
contemporary atmosphere in science and the pivotal role of funding may 
wonder whether even an angel from heaven could remove the financial 
mire from the doors of the contemporary "temple of science." Finding 
elegant solutions to unavoidable predicaments, though, tests man's capacity 
for civilized behavior. Coming generations have to find a way to live up to 
that challenge.

CHAPTER XVI
QUANTUM UNDERSTANDING IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
1. Frame of Mind
Since all that is said here has been said before, I ask indulgence for this 
additional account. Let it be taken as a legal writ to set the stage for freeing 
the spirit from what has been said; it is here attempted by repeating in dif­
ferent order that what has been said before.
Quantum mechanics, as manifested in the Schroedinger eigenvalue 
procedures, has become a sophisticated and finely honed calculational pro­
cess. Articles using the process, and textbooks explaining it, reveal how 
physicists have become extremely clever in calculating experimentally ver­
ifiable results without really telling why they do what they do.
The modem way of presenting is by emphasis on relevance. The steps 
taken must be justified by results. This way of working is fairly universal 
and may not necessarily stop short of a disposition that sanctifies the means 
if they leads to a desired goal.
Those who have been engaged in the sport of calculus know that solving 
integrals can be critically dependent on making the right substitutions. The 
end result, or lack thereof, then justifies or rejects the chosen substitution.
Yet, for some cases, there is no general key. Somebody in the past had 
a stroke of genius and just did it. These are instances where science can be­
come an art. However, of all the conceivable functions that exist, the arse­
nal of known algebraic and transcendental functions occupies only a tiny 
sector. This humbling thought can help us realize that in a wider science 
context, finding the right substitutions is a game we play to serve a more 
encompassing objective.
Mindful of the delicate balance between science and artistry, let us now 
turn to quantum mechanics, and the Schroedinger equation in particular. It 
takes artistry to deal with the Schroedinger equation. While artistry does 
not always serve pragmatism, in quantum mechanics, pragmatism is served 
by artistry. One does not need to know why it works to make it work. 
Those of us who operate computers know this to be true. The famous self- 
made English mathematician, Oliver Heaviside, told us a long time ago:
255

256
CHAPTER XVI
"To enjoy a good meal, one does not need to know how it has been 
prepared." He was referring to his unconventional operational procedures 
that were later confirmed and substantiated by his academic colleagues.
The Heaviside episode took place in the last part of the Nineteenth Cen­
tury. Not to prematurely denounce unconventional genius was a lesson for 
academia. Now, moving forward in time to the second quartile of the 
Twentieth century, a quirk of fate placed academia in the very same posi­
tion Heaviside had found himself half-a-century earlier. The Schroedinger 
equation was bom. It was a gift from heaven, somewhat akin to Heaviside's 
operational calculus. It did a marvelous job, by giving numerous correct 
and useful results.
It was shown to duplicate an earlier procedure, initiated by Heisenberg. 
Subsequently, it appeared that the ready-made spectral theory of Hilbert 
spaces emerged as the ideal instrument to serve this new physics discipline, 
which was now called "quantum mechanics." Finally Dirac's relativistic 
version was hailed as the synthetic penultimate which was taken to replace, 
in one fell swoop, both Newtonian and relativistic mechanics.
Yet, notwithstanding these lofty perspectives, science willingly acknowl­
edged that questions persisted. Where was the complete physical rationale 
leading to this amazing instrument of science? Schroedinger had used an 
interesting transcription. He never claimed it to be a "proof." The proof 
of the pudding was wholly in the eating, which, of course, was much aided 
by having this near perfect Spectral Theory of Hilbert spaces ready to 
serve the good cause. Hermann Weyl had called it "a favor of fortune" that 
so much mathematical perfection could fit like a glove on a physics proce­
dure that had still retained so many conceptual obscurities.
It is one of those ironies of fate, that half a century after Heaviside had 
his trouble with academia, academia herself adopted the Heaviside 
technique of getting useful results with a tool that was not understood; and 
they had a very good time with it. The artists, who knew how to make 
music with this wonderful new instrument called the "Schroedinger equa­
tion," preferred not to over-analyze its physical meaning. After all, unlike 
the case of Heaviside, everything now seemed mathematically well above­
board, protected, as it were, by the towering authority of Hilbert. Should 
not that fact alone sanctify the physical implications? Then, last, but not 
least, there was perhaps a little bit of that underlying fear, that probing 
unduly into the origins of a gift from heaven might in the end kill the 
magic of the method's wonderful potential.
Yet, the quest for knowing more about the physical angle will ultimately 
transcend the special talents that have so diligently and competently 
exhausted a set of almost conspiring coincidental circumstances. Perhaps 
their urge to excel in this wonderfully pragmatic artistry of Schroedinger- 
generated mathematics may now be sublimated and redirected in the 

QUANTUM UNDERSTANDING IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
257
opening up new horizons. Let us probe some of the ideas of what people 
believe or imagine is going on behind the scenes in that equation.
2. Existing Understanding
The efforts at physically understanding the usefulness of Hilbert's spec­
tral theory for quantum mechanics are here best examined in the perspec­
tive of the following constructive highlights that had a determining influ­
ence on the structure of the theory:
1. Schroedinger's smeared-out particle model was a first attempt at 
replacing the Newtoniam point-particle by a finite particle extension. 
There was an underlying assumption that the wave equation described a 
single system. Schroedinger's scheme was abandoned for more particle 
systems, because it led to the uncomfortable image of smeared-out particles 
interpenetrating in actual physical space.
2. The uncertainty relation entered quantum mechanics in essentially 
two steps. Heisenberg first presented the principle as a consequence of 
measurement consideration. The process shows a distant kinship with 
Abbe's famous diffraction criterion limiting the resolving power of an op­
tical instrument, which, in turn, can be seen as a precision criterion for 
truncated Fourier expansions. The subsequent derivation of the uncertainty 
relation from the Schroedinger equation by Kennard then did much to con­
solidate its position as a navigational marker for future courses of action.
3. Copenhagen Interpretations: Schroedinger's smeared-out particle, 
and his equivalence proof of matrix and wave mechanics, as well as 
Kennard's derivation of uncertainty, carried suggestions that had an induc­
tive role for Bom’s subsequent interpretation of the wave function as a 
probability amplitude. From that point on, dating back to the early 
Thirties, the Copenhagen interpretation emerged as a statistical description 
of single-system behavior.
4. Ensemble Interpretations: The Copenhagen interpretation could, in a 
sense, be regarded as a Gibbs-type ensemble of conceivable manifestations 
of one and the same single system. Popper argued that the epistemologi­
cal basis for that sort of a supposition was not very convincing, because all, 
at that time, available observations could either be traced to real physical 
ensembles of many systems in a domain of space (spectra) or to a stream of 
particles (Davisson-Germer experiment) representing an ensemble 
randomly stretched out in time. The ensemble observation "stretched out 
in time" came suspiciously close to Copenhagen's Gibb's-type ensemble of 
conceivable manifestations of one single system. The Copenhagen single­
system and real physical ensemble interpretations have been able to coexist 
without major confrontations for more than half a century.

258
CHAPTER XVI
5. Hidden Variables: In the course of time, the Copenhagen point of 
view generated questions as to whether or not the Schroedinger description 
could be considered as complete. The absence of an explicit universe of 
discourse for the statistics of the Copenhagen description led to a terminol­
ogy referring to it as "nonclassical." By the same token, this led to sugges­
tions that there were variables to which this nonclassical statistics applied, 
but perhaps they had to be regarded as hidden variables. In the early 
Fifties, David Bohml became an explicit spokesman for this way of think­
ing. These developments became known as "hidden variable theory."
6. Bell's Theorem: In 1964, John S. Bell2 succeeded in proving a theo­
rem indicating that the existence of local hidden variables would lead to 
certain inequalities, which would constitute deviations from the predictions 
of standard theory. Experiments by Aspect^ and coworkers in 1982 did not 
support the inequalities. Instead, they confirmed standard quantum mechan­
ical predictions. This event had to be regarded as taking away the physical 
basis for a local hidden variable theory.
The last episode places Bell and Aspect et al in the attention center as 
saviors of the pragmatist view of the quantum formalism, as it presently 
exists. It did not resolve the ensemble-versus-single-system issue. Hence 
worries about interpretation have persisted. In informal encounters, Bell 
himself has been reported as saying about the Copenhagen views: some­
thing is rotten in the state of Denmark. A remark that was, of course, not 
meant to reflect on the denizens of Denmark.
3. Local and Global Concepts in Mathematics and Physics
In the discussions of Bell's theorem, a new concept called "local" is 
found to play a key role in the assessment of physical situations. In view 
of the importance of this seemingly innocuous restriction, a more incisive 
discussion is in order. The concept local and its counterpart, the concept 
of global, have gained a prominent role in mathematics since the Twenties. 
This increased awareness was generated by developments in topology and 
in differential geometry. The integral counterpart of the latter made these 
distinctions more necessary now than at any time earlier.
Two other words, or rather two other expressions, have been, and still 
are, in circulation, conveying that same distinction. They are in the small 
and in the large. Here, we shall prefer the words local and global, because 
in the small and in the large have a metric connotation implying size. In 
physics, an elementary particle or an isolated atom or molecule, are global 
entities, even if they are conceived of as being very small.
Marston Morsel who has been a pioneer in pursuing the mathematical 
implications of these concepts, mentions that it is not easy to grasp the 

QUANTUM UNDERSTANDING IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
259
essence of these notions in a set of satisfactory definitions. Hence, if it is 
already difficult to do so within the framework of mathematics, one may 
expect added complications in the process of extending these concepts to the 
realm of physics. Before any definition should be given, it is necessary to 
develop first a level of greater awareness for these distinctions. For the 
time being, we do well to follow Morse's counsel by assuming that it does 
not seem necessary, or even desirable, that hard-and-fast definitions be 
given, (compare chapter VI; 1 and chapter III;6)
Without hard definitions, the process of getting acquainted with the con­
cepts "local" and "global" in physics is by delineating parts of existing 
physics according to known local and global perspectives. Electromagnetic 
theory is an almost ideal example for bringing out the physical relevance of 
these concepts in their full stature.
Local and Global in Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism is governed by two major global laws. They are 
(1) charge conservation expressed by the exactness of the 3-form of charge 
density and current density C=[p j] and (2) flux conservation expressed by 
the exactness of the 2-form F= Global conservation is mathemati­
cally expressed as a global criterion of exactness by the fact that their 
cyclic integrals vanish for all cycles:
global charge conservation: £11= 0 
global flux conservation: 
= &
for all cycles C3 
for all cycles C2
The local counterpart of these laws are obtained by calling on Stokes 
law; one thus obtains the more familiar differential laws:
dC=0; local conservation of charge.
dF=0; local conservation of flux (first set of Maxwell equations).
The exactness of C and F has a further global consequence, according to 
a theorem by de Rham;^ modulo an exact part, there exist globally
defined 1-forms A and 2-forms d such that
F= dA ; definition equation of the vector potential.
C= dG ; the second set of source related Maxwell equations.
An extended global interpretation of these relations is now dictated by 
existing knowledge of physics. All sources of charge are known to be dis­
crete and multiples of an elementary charge e their worldlines can be 
"linked" by cycles z2 residing where C=0. For flux, instances of discrete 
units are manifest, provided some specific conditions are obeyed. It thus 
goes a step further by stating that all flux can only be a multiple of an 
elementary discrete unit h/2 if, and only if, it can be viewed as linked by 

260
CHAPTER XVI
cycles Zj residing where F=0. Another de Rham^ theorem now permits, 
on the basis of those premises, the claim:
= the Ampere-Gauss integral counts units e "linked" by z2
^Z]A = Aharonov-Bohm integral counts units h/2e linked by zl
This one-page breakdown of electromagnetic fundamentals is an only 
slightly idealized local-global reorganization of existing well-established 
knowledge. The principal difference with respect to standard versions is a 
changed emphasis of awareness. This modified presentation recognizes as 
an integral part of electromagnetic theory a quantum superstructure of pe­
riod integrals, enabling us to count units of charge and flux.
Local and Global in Quantum Mechanics
Let us now see if we can make a similar examination of the existing 
tools of quantum mechanics on the basis of this newly acquired awareness 
of local and global connotations.
The differential relation intimated by the Schroedinger equation has to 
be identified as a statement of local conditions with global ramifications as 
imposed by the boundary conditions. Let us see whether we can pinpoint in 
some detail the global implications of these boundary conditions, by exam­
ining a specific case.
An application of the Schroedinger equation to cyclotron motion 
(Landau) reveals that the zero-point energy component in (n +| )hco is 
due to the boundary condition of square integrability. A Larmor-type sit­
uation, such as prevails for the superconducting ring, having fixed radius 
orbitals, by contrast, reveals an absence of zero-point energy. The bound­
ary condition of single-valuedness now gives quantum states ntico with 
n=l,2,......
We learn from this comparison that the boundary condition of single 
valuedness governs a global feature, which can apply in the small on a very 
local level, whereas the condition of square integrability governs behavior 
at infinity which, to say the least, has definitely a more environmental con­
notation. Here, we have an interesting reminder of Marston Morse's 
warning not to rush into fast and hard definitions of local and global. We 
also have a reminder that, unless specified to the contrary, the terminology 
local-global is to be preferred over the terminology of in the large versus 
in the small, because single-valuedness is a global condition, which can 
have a very pronounced connotation "in the small." In fact, in the next 
paragraphs, a new use is proposed of the terms "in the small" and "in the 
large," which is in better keeping with their metric connotation of size.

QUANTUM UNDERSTANDING IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
261
Let us ask hereto what this cyclotron-Larmor comparison tell us about 
the interpretational aspects of the Schroedinger process? The fact is: The 
Schroedinger process imposes global conditions in the small and in the 
large. Unless very outlandish schemes of interpretation are admitted, it 
will not be possible to accommodate this local-global dichotomy in the 
Copenhagen perspective of a single system existing in the small. 
Nonclassical conceptual excursions are the prize to pay for accommodation.
By contrast, an ensemble view of the Schroedinger process very natu­
rally accommodates this dichotomy of boundary conditions. The new state 
of affairs can now be succinctly summarized as follows:
The Micro- and Macro Roles of Global Conditions
The global boundary conditions can govern "in the small" the individual 
systems in an ensemble. Other global boundary conditions can govern "in 
the large" the behavior of system elements in the context of the totality of 
the ensemble (compare chapter III; 6).
The next section gives a realignment of an avalanche of already existing 
evidence that further corroborates an ensemble connotation for the mixed 
local-global Schroedinger process. This realignment also leads to an iden­
tification of a universe of discourse of the presumed nonclassical statistics 
of the Schroedinger process.
4. A New Perspective on Quantum Understanding
Our next step is an identification of a set of presumed hidden variables 
that, interestingly, can be given both a local as well as a global identifica­
tion. They are the initial conditions characterizing the individual dynamic 
performances of the elements of an ensemble. They are the phase of a dy­
namic system and its orientation in space. Just looking at the performance 
of isolated individual systems, phase and orientation are rather inconse­
quential parameters. They only seem to serve a purpose of mathematical 
pedantry, say, to meet the requirements of a demanding teacher who wants 
us to be aware of the existence of constants of integration.
Now, look at these same hidden variables of phase and orientation from 
an ensemble point of view. It would be most unlikely if the mutual phase 
and orientation between the elements were taken to be inconsequential for 
the ensemble behavior. Clearly, we need to distinguish between phase- and 
orientation-ordered ensembles, such as do occur in meso- and macroscopic 
quantum behavior, versus phase and orientation randomized ensembles.
Nobody less than Max Planck^ felt that we had an obligation to look 
into these matters. He indeed did so in 1912, and showed that an average 
zero-point energy of boo/2 would be necessary to secure a positive

262
CHAPTER XVI
Boltzmann probability for an ensemble of elements that is randomized in 
mutual phase.
Calculations of an average modulus of angular momentum for an en­
semble of randomly oriented elements gives tWn(n+l). This result is re­
ported in a text by Kompaneyets and also in the Feynman Lectures 7 In 
both texts, it is mentioned as an interesting mathematical oddity. There are 
neither attempts at assessing the impact of this result on aspects of interpre­
tation, nor is a comparison made with the earlier reported Planck zero- 
point energy. A mutual relation for large n is hinted by the asymptotics 
7n(n+l) ss n +|.
Summarizing these findings, two typical results with an historic role in 
the rapid acceptance of the Schroedinger process are reproducible by a sta­
tistical processing of real physical ensembles. The individual single sys­
tems are hereto quantized by the earlier asymptotically related Bohr- 
Sommerfeld process.
The Schroedinger quantization is of a hybrid local-global type. The 
Bohr-Sommerfeld process, by contrast, is purely global. The asymptotic 
relation between Schroedinger and Bohr-Sommerfeld methods is not 
merely a mathematical approximation. It reflects physical asymptotics in 
that one addresses single systems; the other addresses ensembles thereof.
5. Conclusion
We can now be very brief about how all this relates to Bohm and Bell. 
Phase and orientation can simply be taken as examples of David Bohm's 
hidden variables. They deviously slipped through the mazes of Bell's theo­
rem, because locally, they are inconsequential, and globally, they are out­
side the realm of jurisdiction of Bell's theorem.
Local and global in quantum mechanics can now be further examined in 
the context of relativity. The Kretschmann^ and Bridgman^ objections 
against Diffeo-4 invariance are now to be delineated for aspects of numeri­
cal- and form-invariance. Numerical invariance for the global residues of 
period integrals is fine, yet, locally, in the sense of crystal physics' 
Neumann principle, it could eliminate just about all local constitutive 
behavior. Hence, we can repeat after Pierre Curie: "C'est 1'assymetrie qui 
fait 1'effect." Meaning: "the effect is in the asymmetry." Hence, numerical 
local Diffeo-4 invariance could only convey a trivial amorphous state of 
affairs, leaving no effects whatsoever. Seen in this perspective, 
Kretschmann and Bridgman would have had a point afer all.

QUANTUM UNDERSTANDING IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
263
Nontrivial numerical Diffeo-4 invariant objects are global in 
nature. Examples are the integrals of chapter VI, which either identify 
quanta as periods or express conservation. Examples of Diffeo-4 form­
invariance are the Stokes theorems and the exterior derivatives of forms. 
When carried to its logical conclusion, the Kretschmann-Bridgman episode 
of assault on the principle of general covariance ironically justifies this 
principle in the end. In addition, it yields, in local-global perspective, a 
distinction between constitutive law and media-independent fundamental 
law. Discerning application can make the principle of general covariance a 
powerful ally in theorizing, whereas indiscriminate rejection of the 
principle is surely an open invitation to create confusion and disorder.
After taking a more discerning view of the principle of general 
covariance, by including notions of local versus global and matters of 
metric-dependence versus metric-independence, it would seem that 
Einstein's 10 intuitive defense of covariance is vindicated at last.

CHAPTER XVII
ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
1. 
Absolute Indeterminism
Contemporary physics may be said to adhere, somewhat hesitantly, to a 
principle that could be called "absolute indeterminism." In practice, the 
hesitation means that perhaps a majority of physicists vaguely confess to 
subscribe to such a point of view for what they perceive as practical 
reasons. This portrayal of attitudes, with respect to quantum fundamentals, 
is in many ways characteristic of Copenhagen-type interpretations.
This Copenhagen scheme culminates in the Heisenberg uncertainty rela­
tion. The latter, when taken in the Copenhagen spirit, supports a point of 
view that might be called an expression of nonclassical pragmatism. This 
unorthodox pragmatism has a measure of inner consistency, as predicated 
by the uncertainty relation that led to the Copenhagen view of things.
The Heisenberg uncertainty relation says that the magnitude of two 
conjugate variables describing the state of a system, cannot be simultane­
ously known with arbitrary precision. If position q and momentum p rep­
resent a conjugate pair, the uncertainty relation claims that the product of 
the observed position uncertainty Aq, and momentum uncertainty Ap, is 
subject to the inequality
ApAq>h, 
1
in which h is Planck's constant. The Copenhagen School boldly claims that 
any object from planet to elementary particle is everywhere and at any 
time subject to this inequality.
The relation originally was obtained using an idea that any observation 
had to disturb the object of observation. This original argument serves as a 
means for obtaining the uncertainty relation; it carries a connotation that 
uncertainty is an all-pervading feature of nature, contingent on the act of 
observing.
There is a Schroedinger-based derivation of this uncertainty relation, 
which, all by itself, carries a suggestion of observer-independence. When 
taken in the spirit of the Copenhagen single-system view, this Schroedinger 
uncertainty assumes the nature of an all-pervading a priori feature of all 
single systems. Yet, when taken in the spirit of an ensemble view, this
264

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
265
uncertainty becomes a feature of ensemble disorder. The precise statistical 
nature of uncertainty, whether taken in the single system or the ensmble 
vein, is according to prevailing teachings believed to be unknown. The 
temperature does not have a role as a statistical distribution parameter in 
this so-called "nonclassical statistics."
Since inequality (1) translates into an equivalent state of continual 
motion, uncertainty thus indicates the existence of a residual state of kinetic 
energy. It has become customary to call this uncertainty-based energy a 
zero-point energy.
In assessing the details of these relations, the reader should be aware 
that the inequality (1) can be affected by, give and take, a numerical factor, 
depending on the line of reasoning used to obtain it (e.g., the Heisenberg or 
Kennard approach). Since it is an inequality, not anywhere close to 
experimental verification, not much attention is given to these small 
changes. It proves experiment has rarely been close enough to even testing 
true limits of these inequalities.
Since uncertainty suggests a measure of indeterminism in physics, it has 
produced a large literature, some of it clever, but not so relevant, and some 
not so clever, but perhaps relevant. Let us aim here at relevance, even if it 
may not reach the pinnacle of cleverness.
2. 
Relative Indeterminism
The cited less radical, yet less popular, point of view holds that uncer­
tainty and zero-point energy are typical ensemble manifestations and not to 
be associated with any or every isolated single system. Uncertainty thus 
emerges as a criterion of ensemble "awareness." Since there are many 
phases of ensemble awareness, as substantiated by the solid and liquid states 
of matter all the way to diluted gaseous states, a set of typical specifications 
is necessary to tell us under what circumstances an ensemble resides in the 
zero-point state.
Planck,! who introduced the concept of zero-point energy in 1912 as an 
ensemble-based phenomenon, gave us the first physical specification of that 
zero-point ensemble. The ensemble statistics is pre-thermal, as would be 
fitting for a zero-point state, and its universe of discourse is determined by 
the mutual phases of the constituent elements of the ensemble. It is hereby 
assumed that Planck's ensemble consists of identical dynamical periodic 
systems, the phases of which are taken to be random.
There are mechanisms known that can create a phase order in such an 
ensemble. If such a situation prevails, there is no longer a statistical situa­
tion and there is reason to speak of a macroscopic quantum effect! The 
quantum Hall effect is a recent discovery that belongs in this category.

266
CHAPTER XVII
Yet, as long as phase-disorder prevails, there is a statistics with the help 
of which a statistical probability of the ensemble can be evaluated. In this 
manner, Planck showed that the zero-point energy is a sine qua non for a 
phase random ensemble to have a nonnegative probability. By excluding 
negative probabilities as meaningless, the ensemble is forced to assume a 
lowest average energy of boo/2 per ensemble element.
3. 
Comparing Absolute and Relative Indeterminism
An ensemble-based interpretation of the Schroedinger equation has been 
around for a long time. The philosopher Popped has been known as an 
articulate spokesman supporting an ensemble view. The epistemological 
arguments he used have proven to be lasting; they are as valid today as 
when they were launched for the first time in 1934.
Einstein strongly supported Popper's epistemological point of view, 
even if he did not agree with some of Popper's physical arguments. Popper 
conceded to having made physical mistakes, yet, apart from these mistakes, 
the basic issues, raised by Popper, have remained very much alive.
However, after one lonely ensemble supporter (Popper) had to admit to 
the error of his ways to another ensemble supporter (Einstein), many took 
for granted that nothing much was left of the ensemble point of view. 
Those willing to read the footnotes in the published Einstein-Popper 
correspondence^ will find that Einstein supported Popper's position.
Rather than directly supporting the ensemble view, Einstein and 
coworkers, Rosen and Podolsky, were, at the time, attempting to home in 
on conceivable internal inconsistencies of the Copenhagen point of view. 
As it was, the cited differences in procedures (i.e., Popper’s frontal attack 
and the EPR consistency check) turned out to be fatal to the ensemble point 
of view in the Thirties and served neither Popper nor Einstein, Rosen and 
Podolsky.
Slater may have been an earlier supporter of the ensemble idea when the 
Copenhagen interpretation was still in status nascendi. He first reluctantly 
went along with Bohr and Kramers, but later changed his position. Slater^ 
reports that his change of heart led to a considerable cooling in his rela­
tions with Bohr.
It is not precisely known whether either Popper^ or Slater^ did any­
thing to specify their ensembles so as to bridge the gap to Planck's zero­
point ensemble. 1 The phase-random ensemble of Planck yields, per ele­
ment, the same zero-point energy as the Schroedinger equation, except that 
Planck's zero-point energy is an ensemble average, whereas Schroedinger's 
value, in the Copenhagen spirit, is a "quantum mechanical" average for 
which there is no universe of discourse, as required by statistical theory.

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
267
Contemporary physics makes this absence of a universe of discourse 
explicit in its terminology by calling the statistics "nonclassical" in nature.
In the early days of Planck's zero-point discussions, there was, of 
course, not yet a Schroedinger equation to tell us about zero-point energy. 
When Schroedinger's equation was first solved for the harmonic oscillator, 
how did it became known that the extra 1/2 quantum number, demanded by 
the Hermite polynomials, should have a zero-point connotation?
While Schroedinger did not fail to mention Planck, those who followed 
left Planck completely out of the picture. Few of the Copenhagen-based 
textbooks, if any, find it necessary to quote Planck on this subject. The rea­
son is simple: Planck's argument does not exactly reflect supportively on 
the Copenhagen point of view. Our contemporary textbook authors prac­
tice a policy of letting sleeping dogs slumber. Having the Copenhagen point 
of view comes across, unencumbered by undue and perhaps "premature" 
doubts, has had an unwarranted priority.
It is downright astonishing, though, that neither the textbook claiming to 
present the ensemble point of view have mentioned Planck's zero-point en­
semble. Even Ballentine's^ most recent scholarly contribution to the en­
semble-based literature has no reference to Planck's zero-point discussions, 
notwithstanding recent evidence in which the existence of such a connection 
has been reiterated.$ How could the ensemble supporters have 
missed out on such a golden opportunity of getting Planck's au­
thoritative evidence of 19i3 to help them?
It is hard to find a conclusive answer to this question, because, in the en­
during mist of nonclassical conceptualization dependence on logical infer­
ence no longer holds a major position. Since Planck's zero-point work 
took place prior to the inception of the Schroedinger equation, it presum­
ably was taken for granted that his phase-randomized ensemble of elements 
could not possibly have any bearing on a physical understanding of an 
equation, which saw the light of day more than a decade later. It is a fact 
that even the ensemble proponents still appear to be blinded by the 
nonclassical mystique of the new quantum mechanics of 1925-1926.
Along with the Copenhageners, the ensemble people presumably also 
feel that a Schroedinger-type ensemble could not possibly have been antici­
pated by Planck in 1912. Yet perhaps Planck did just that! At least here 
was, and still is today, an option that should have been thoroughly investi­
gated prior to launching into a long string of nonclassical conceptualiza­
tions. What has happened, however, is that this option has been tacitly 
pushed aside as inconvenient by Copenhageners and ensemble people both, 
without any explicit or obvious justification whatsoever.
What is the upshot of this comparison between absolute and relative in­
determinism? At first it seems rather unscientific to rule out relative 

268
CHAPTER XVII
indeterminism and then replace it with an absolute indeterminism with its 
host of nonclassical conceptualizations. Even under Copenhagen domi­
nation, the option of an ensemble-based origin of quantum mechanical 
indeterminism should have had an opportunity to defend itself against the 
indiscriminate onslaught of the absolute, all-pervading, indeterminism that 
has ruled supreme with near-totalitarian inflexibility for so long.
In the heat of these discussions, it is necessary to keep in mind that rela­
tive indeterminism means restoring determinism to its proper place in 
physics. The tools permitting to accomplish such an assignment are dis­
cussed in section 6.
4. 
The Position of Determinism
Assuming we do away with the absolute rule of indeterminism, then 
where do we go from there? Presumably, it should be necessary to 
readdress the question as to whether any role is left to determinism, which, 
in turn, means restoring a measure of causality to physics. Pending 
problems, precipitated by an all-encompassing absolute indeterminism, now 
can be resolved. It means we now dare to ask questions which were 
forbidden before. For a long time, we have been intimidated not to ask 
questions that were said not to be meaningful. Here are some questions that 
testify to an ignorance of the iron rules of acceptable manners in "modem" 
quantum mechanics.
If the Schroedinger equation now is taken to be an instrument 
describing solely phase-random Planck ensembles, how are we going to 
describe physical situations that cannot possibly accommodate a feature of 
phase randomness? Planck had an answer to that question. His quantiza­
tion rules, similarly as those of Bohr-Sommerfeld, effectively imposed a 
discreteness of the action integrals of Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics, thus 
retaining, in the classical sense, a truly deterministic single-system 
description.
Seen in retrospect, Planck thus injected an ensemble indeterminism by 
imposing phase randomness between the elements of the ensemble. In two 
dimensions, phase randomness is an adequate characterization. In three 
dimensions, mutual-phase comparison invokes also the mutual orientation 
of the ensemble elements. Hence, in three dimensions, random phase can 
be accompanied by random orientation.
Let us assume Planck was correct in his inference that zero-point energy 
is a condition of statistical equilibrium for a phase-and-orientation random­
ized ensemble. Now, consider that phase randomization gives, according to 
Planck, a Schroedinger result of (n +l/Zihoo, whereas directional random­
ization gives, as explained in the Feynman Lectures,6 another Schroedinger 
result of aJ n(n + 1)1n for the average modulus of angular momentum per el­

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
269
ement in the ensemble. In witness of this rather unusual coincidence, 
would it not be fair to conclude, or to at least consider, the possibility that 
Schroedinger's equation describes perhaps a Planck ensemble?
Yet, neither the Feynman lectures nor the text by Kompaneyets^ ex­
plicitly relate the quantum numbers (n+1/2) and ^n(n+l) to an ensemble 
interpretation. The calculations are presented as potential curiosities.
Any responsible answer would have to give the perfectly classical phase- 
and-orientation statistics priority over a nonclassical statistics without a 
universe of discourse, as proposed by the Copenhagen School. Yet, for un­
explained, and perhaps unexplainable reasons, even contemporary ensemble 
proponents have failed to take advantage of this early opportunity offered 
by Planck to obtain a measure of understanding for the solutions of the 
Schroedinger equation.
Probing further into this situation, it is necessary to become more 
explicit about the deterministic tools of quantum mechanics, because the 
Schroedinger equation now has a restricted realm of applicability. Another 
reason for probing further has to do with a superstructure of the 
Schroedinger equation, known as quantum electrodynamics (QED). The 
conceptual structure of QED is contingent on Copenhagen views, if the 
Copenhagen view is abandoned, how is that going to affect QED?
5. 
The Field Tools of Quantization (Chapter VI)
The quantization tools, used during the era preceding the Schroedinger 
process, were all related to analytical dynamics. The Bohr-Sommerfeld 
integrals have become regarded as the prototype tools of that era. In 
keeping with prevailing thought of that time, these tools were considered as 
quantum superstructures of the deterministic tools of analytic dynamics.
From a point of view of field theory, the Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals 
share the restrictions of a theory that has been developed around the con­
cept of the point-particle. The Schroedinger process initially got rid of the 
point-particle abstraction by smearing out its presence. When many particle 
situations made this position untenable, the Copenhagen interpretation, in­
stead, further consolidated the point-particle abstraction. A postulated 
vanishing spatial presence of the particle was needed to give the 
Copenhagen probability interpretation an approximate measure of physical 
reality. Hence, more than before in the Newtonian context, the point-par­
ticle had become a cornerstone in the Copenhagen process. In the 
Newtonian process, by contrast, the definitions of centers of mass and 
gravity made the point-particle abstraction at least mathematically per­
missible. Yet, Newtonian multi-particle situations share three-body 
complications, also in the case of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization.

270
CHAPTER XVII
There is, however, a good field analogue of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rela­
tions in the form of the one-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm integral.7 The 
latter also is known to work well in multiple-particle situations. The super­
conducting ring is a striking example for a boson accumulation in the same 
quantum state. Many particles (pairs) may be circulating in the ring, yet 
they all cooperate to give a single quantized flux state!
There is a two-dimensional analogue of the one-dimensional Aharonov- 
Bohm integral, which comes straight out of electromagnetic theory. It is 
the Ampere-Gauss integral,8 which counts the number of particles circu­
lating in the ring.
The one-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm integral and the two-dimensional 
Ampere-Gauss integral are spacetime integrals. One counts quanta of flux 
units, the other counts quanta of electric charge units. These integrals have 
many remarkable properties. First of all, they are period integrals that can 
be assessed in the framework of a de Rham^ cohomology for electromag­
netic fields. This means these integrals are spacetime topological invariants. 
Hence, unlike the general relativistic Dirac equations, these integrals 
comply in a simple and beautiful manner with Einstein's principle of 
general spacetime covariance!
There is much more, though. Since these integrals count fundamental 
units of physics, such as flux and electric charge, their counting should not 
be affected whether flux and charge are expressed in cgs, MKS, or, if you 
will, in nonmetric units. Hence, these integrals must be metric-indepen­
dent, general spacetime invariants. This permits us to draw the following 
conclusion:
Since the metric is the one and truly only criterion distin­
guishing between macro- and microphysical situations, metric­
independence now becomes an exclusive feature for securing 
both macro- and micro-applicability.
A third three-dimensional integral is necessary for accomplishing a 
complete cohomological assessment of electromagnetic field configurations. 
An integral of this nature has been introduced by R.M. Kiehn.10 Together 
with the earlier-mentioned one- and two-dimensional integrals, this three­
dimensional integral completes the set of period integrals to assess one-, 
two-, and three-connectedness of electromagnetic field configurations. The 
physical function of this three-dimensional integral is that of counting 
action units of integrated spin-and-angular momentum. Knotting of the 
integration cycles here discriminates between spin-and-angular momentum 
action components (chapters VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XIV).
All of these integrals already have been in use in physics in one way or 
another. In the context of a de Rham cohomology, they appear as an or­
ganized tool for establishing connectedness and counting flux charge and 

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
271
action units. H These integrals are, in fact, a natural global superstructure 
of Maxwell theory.
It is in the nature of a field theoretical transition if the "point" features 
of mechanics are replaced by the distributed connotation of the electro­
magnetic field. The mechanical connotations of the electromagnetic field, 
in the sense of a continuum mechanics, already were recognized by 
Maxwell. The ensuing universal reduction of mechanical characteristics to 
a common electromagnetic origin has been an ideal, which has enjoyed an 
off-and-on viability in the wake of Maxwellian theory. In the light of a 
cohomological assessment it will appear that more fundamental particle 
structures can be reduced to an electromagnetic origin than hitherto was 
thought to be possible. The metric-free global superstructure of electro­
magnetic theory, in the sense of a de Rham cohomology, makes this exten­
sion a more feasible proposition than in the past (chapters XIII and XIV).
The deterministic nature of this global superstructure of Maxwell the­
ory needs to be emphasized, because it is a natural extension of determinis­
tic theory in the form of the existence of discrete quanta of electric charge 
and flux. Nowhere has a statistical element been injected. The three pe­
riod counting laws are as deterministic as the Bohr-Sommerfeld relations. 
The only uncertainty to be envisioned here is a counting error of quanta. 
The fundamental thesis of this discussion holds out for a position that such 
uncertainties are not a priori, but induced by ensemble behavior.
6. 
QED and Quantum Superstructure (QS)
There is some evidence that the quantum superstructure (QS) of 
Maxwell theory exhibits an overlap of applicability with traditional quan­
tum electrodynamics (QED). Yet, the latter definitely is indeterministic, 
whereas the other (QS) is deterministic. Some inquiry is necessary to un­
derstand how this can be reconciled.
An example of such an overlap occurs in the case of an evaluation of the 
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and muon. Either method can 
give the observed answer, yet QED requires a subtraction of infinities in 
the sense of renormalization. The other method of using QS, by contrast, 
does not invoke a processing of infinities, but demands, instead, a more de­
tailed model of what the electron or muon are supposed to be.
QED operates with the artifact that physical space is permeated with 
zero-point energy, with each degree of freedom holding an energy hco/Z. 
Integrated over the free-space spectrum from 0 to oo, this energy is diver­
gent. Depending on the physical situation at hand, the QED process sub­
tracts out the infinities and can retain finite meaningful end results.
A reasonably transparent example is provided by the van der Waals 
forces between two parallel plates. Casimir 12 has shown how this force 

272
CHAPTER XVII
can be calculated as a radiation pressure differential between the outside 
space and the inside space between the plates. The finite force differential 
comes about because, between the plates, there is a low-frequency cut-off 
determined by the distance between the plates.
The infinite forces on either side of the plates defy our normal sense of 
physical reality. Yet, the finite differential between infinite radiation pres­
sures serves as a useful calculational expedient confirming an observed re­
sult. This final result seems perfectly deterministic in nature. However, to 
obtain it, space is imagined as filled with an infinite zero-point energy. 
Since the latter earlier was identified as a special manifestation of quantum 
uncertainty, it reveals the fundamentally indeterministic nature of QED. 
The subtraction process of infinities thus leads us to believe, or even con­
clude, that the process of renormalization eliminates the indeterministic 
features. QED results thus have a chance of being reproduced with the 
help of QS methods of quantum cohomology (chapter VIII). 13
Let it be known that the record of achievement of QED is, at this point, 
much more extensive than that of QS. So the overlap of results is hardly a 
reason to abandon QED for QS, solely because the latter does not deal with 
infinities. In cases where QED and QS can be made to agree, there is, 
however, a remarkable difference of information input. The QED method, 
which, in principle, rests on the point-particle notion, seems, for all 
practical purposes, model-independent. The QS method, here earlier 
referred to as quantum cohomology, QC, demands a specification of 
topology and metric features of the object under consideration.
The QED feature of model-independence frequently is hailed as a mark 
of superiority of an abstract approach. Yet, the potential equivalence of 
model-independent and model-dependent processes provide intriguing per­
spectives, deserving of more extensive investigations. Eq.33, chapter XI:7, 
gives the most metric-independent, yet model-dependent example of using 
QS and QC methods.
7. 
Determinism and Indeterminism in Schroedinger's Process
If the Schroedinger equation describes an indeterministic Planck en­
semble of deterministic single systems, the feature of determinism and in­
determinism should be simultaneously present in the Schroedinger process. 
This statement holds, regardless of whether one is an ensemble supporter, 
or a supporter of the Copenhagen interpretation.
For further insight into these matters, let us compare some deterministic 
Bohr-Sommerfeld results with some results of the Schroedinger process. 
The two methods give exactly the same result for the stationary states of 
the hydrogen atom. Hence, if the Bohr-Sommerfeld result is deterministic, 
so is the Schroedinger result. In standard quantum mechanical terminology, 

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
273
the hydrogen states are said to correspond to the diagonal elements of the 
matrix of quantum states. Their expectation value is one, as expressed by 
the normalized wave functions.
For the harmonic oscillator, the two results are, however, distinct. The 
stationary states, according to the Schroedinger equation, are shifted by the 
zero-point energy with respect to the states obtained with the Bohr- 
Sommerfeld recipe. Yet, from a Schroedinger point of view, the normal­
ized Hermite polynomials assign an expectation value onto the stationary 
states (n +1/2)11 co, regardless of whether n=0 or n#0. Hence, the deter­
ministic Bohr-Sommerfeld states, shifted by the indeterministic zero-point 
energy, acquire, in the end, a deterministic veneer through the 
Schroedinger process.
In the Copenhagen vein, this result may become acceptable by consider­
ing the energy uncertainty relation AEAt >h. For stationary states At-*®® 
hence, AE-»0.
The upshot of this preliminary inquiry shows how stationary states ap­
pear to be deterministic, regardless of whether they are looked at from a 
Bohr-Sommerfeld or from a Schroedinger point of view. The true nature 
of indeterministic features must be expected to manifest themselves with 
the transition states.
The Bohr-Sommerfeld recipe has no precise quantitative predictions 
about transitions, but the Schroedinger process does. The off-diagonal 
elements of the state matrix are measures for the occurrence of transitions. 
A transition is forbidden if the corresponding element is zero. It was this 
more encompassing feature of transitional selection that caused the 
Schroedinger process to win out over the Bohr-Sommerfeld description. 
The latter was merely restricted to stationary states; there were some ad 
hoc procedures, though, for anticipating transitions. By contrast, the 
Schroedinger-Heisenberg state matrix is able to give precise information.
If the Schroedinger process truly is ensemble-based, transitions would 
be expected to have an ensemble aspect, combined with an individual dis­
position of the element in question, to make a transition. For isolated 
single systems there is at this time no QC theory of transitions. Of course, 
the Copenhagen supporters will tell us that the Schroedinger equation has 
all the answers we are looking for. Here is the strongest practical 
argument of support yet for the Copenhagen point of view. Indeed the 
Schroedinger equation does it, but without giving us physical insight as to 
why it can do it. It certainly was not designed to do so; it happened to be 
able to do so!
Even if presently there is no complete theory of transitions for isolated 
systems, a few words are in order regarding how transition events differ 
topologically from stationary states. Stationary state particles, atoms or 

274
CHAPTER XVII
molecules are represented by worldlines or rather world-tubes with cross 
section structure, all governed by the earlier-mentioned period integrals. 
The three-dimensional integral, however, needs a closure in spacetime. 
The only way of having closure for an indefinitely extending world-tube is 
by having a periodic structure on the world-tube. Elementary structures 
have at least one periodicity. Compound structures can have many more. 
The here-cited feature of worldline periodicity relates to the topological 
concept of Poincare torsion.
A transition event in spacetime is different from a world-tube in that it 
has always a very distinct beginning and end in the time direction. Events 
are isolated spacetime domains from which world-tubes emanate, after 
other world-tubes have terminated there, so as to cause the event to occur. 
Spontaneous events terminate a single world-tube. Induced events are col­
lision nodes in spacetime, they terminate more than one world-tube.
The mentioned characteristics of world-tubes and events are the 
topological characteristics of Feynman diagrams. The question is whether 
the difference between event-domain and world-tube can be successfully 
described by period integrals. The transition-event should be characterized 
by an integral that is guaranteed to vanish when it is applied to a world­
tube configuration; otherwise the physical object characterized by the 
world-tube would be unstable and cease to exist. There are significant 
mathematical perspectives indicating that meaningful distinctions can be 
made to indeed convey such a message. The key to this criterion is that the 
integration domains for events are simply connected, whereas world-tubes 
are product domains, so that the corresponding integrals become product 
integrals.
The mentioned topics have, in part, been explored (chapter XIII) and 
are, in part, suggestions for further inquiry. There is presently no precise 
idea how single system instability and ensemble interaction work together 
to bring about the observed transition propensities. The facts is, the 
Schroedinger equation yields transition propensityin nearly full automatic, 
without requiring any detailed understanding of the transition mechanism.
It is most likely the ensemble's zero-point energy, which triggers the 
"spontaneous" transition in the single-systems that are susceptible to such 
inputs. Whatever the true mechanisms may be, all its results are rather 
magically described by the Schroedinger equation. Yet, amazingly, this 
equation was never constructed to do all this. It just happened to be able to 
render those services as a gift from heaven.
The worst the Schroedinger equation ever did to physics was to raise the 
expectations so high that it was thought to be able to cure problems far be­
yond its realm of applicability. The attempts at justifying these extraterri­
torial excursions were bound to invite a wave of absolute indeterminism 
for washing out the unavoidably ensuing conceptual discrepancies.

8. The Method of Path Integrals
Throughout these discussions, the method of period integration has 
been characterized as a method designed for the treatment of deterministic 
situations, with the enjoining recommendation of restricting the process of 
Schroedinger to indeterministic ensembles. In recent times, the method of 
path integrals has developed into a major instrument for the purpose of 
solving problems in quantum mechanics. Since path integrals and period 
integrals both testify to a measure of global processing, it raises questions 
whether path integrals have a period integral status. Contingent on this 
inquiry, it may be possible to decide whether path integral methods deal 
with the deterministic or the indeterministic aspects of quanta.
A monograph on the subject of path integrals by Feynman and 
Hibbs 14 answers the last part of this inquiry. In the course of their discus­
sion, these authors show, by example, how the path integral method leads 
to the Schroedinger approach. From the point of view taken in this 
endeavor of quantum reprogramming, the Schroedinger approach has been 
classified as pertaining to indeterministics ensembles. It then follows from 
the apparent equivalence of path integral and Schroedinger approaches, as 
proven by Feynman and Hibbs, that the path-integral method needs to be 
categorized as indeterministic in nature. The latter fact then excludes a di­
rect physically consequential relation between path- and period- integrals, 
except the asymptotic relationship sketched in chapter VI;7.
Seen in the perspective of chapter VI;7, the Feynman-Hibbs process 
may be viewed as a quantum mechanical adaptation of Hilbert's integral 
equation formulation of eigenvalue problems. An integral equation so be­
comes the equivalent of a differential equation with boundary condition, 
while the extremum properties of eigenvalues are found to tie in with a 
corresponding variational process. An account of these structural interre­
lations have been superbly highlighted from algebraic as well as analytic 
angles in a classical text by Courant-Hilbert.15
Seen from the angle of Hilbert's integral equations, the path-integral 
process is close to a mathematical reformulation of Schroedinger's eigen­
value process; yet it goes a step further in that also the time-dependent 
Schroedinger equation is obtained from path-integral procedures. The path 
integral has the familiar reflexive feature of a mixed local-global process 
by relating the wave function in a given point to its value anywhere else or, 
in Feynman's own words, "as a sum over a history of states."
A purely mathematical recasting of a given physical situation cannot 
be expected to have a necessarily incisive effect on its physical interpreta­
tion. Yet, reading the Feynman-Hibbs account suggests that Feynman's 
characteristic portrayal of physical phenomena must have been a principal 

276
CHAPTER XVII
motivator for the path-integral process, because any reference to the 
Hilbert alternative of integral equation versus differential equation with 
boundary conditions is absent in the Feynman-Hibbs monograph. 14
The path-integral process may thus, in principle, be assumed to remain 
neutral in the interpretation issue of ensemble versus single system. Yet 
once we come to think of it, the path-integral, which, in Feynman's words, 
is a "sum over a history of states" seems conceptually closer to the mixed 
local-global connotation of an ensemble of identical systems than to a 
strictly global description of a single-system constituent.
9. Where Does Physics Go from Here?
While the familiar contrast expressed by the words classical versus 
nonclassical has been very productive in creating new horizons of mystery 
in physics, by the same token, too much new mystery can be 
counterproductive by presenting a predicament of choice. It also awakens a 
taste for conceptual extremism. Life in a state of self-imposed spiritual 
imprisonment tends to seek solace in the realm of magic.
After rescue from the confinement of universal quantum uncertainty, 
and after having gained spiritual independence from the dogma of an indis­
criminate universal Lorentz invariance, where does physics go from here? 
The answer is: just about anywhere! To get our bearings in this newly- 
created navigational environment, let us retrace some steps that have been 
instrumental in questioning existing dogma.
While Schroedinger's transcription leading to his wave equation had a 
single-system connotation, in the course of time other transcriptions 
emerged that favored an ensemble background for the Schroedinger equa­
tion. Work of this nature was initiated by Fuerth, Fenyes, Bohm-Vigier 
and Weizel, pointing out relations with diffusion and the equations of con­
tinuum mechanics. An over-enthusiastic overview of these matters by 
Nelson 16 makes it appear as if all these nonclassical escapades would have 
been unnecessary. Nelson cuts short all those detours of the human mind 
occurring in the process of exploring new territory. He injects a zero­
point diffusion potential in classical equations, and behold, all of nonclas­
sical quantum mechanics emerges.
While Nelson's account has the virtue of reducing matters to the math­
ematical essentials, a better physical perspective on the physical nature of 
this zero-point potential is needed. Some precious insights to this effect 
have been added in a series of papers by Boyer. W Where Einstein's famous 
derivation of Planck's distribution law leaves out the zero-point energy, 
Boyer shows that the Planck distribution, plus zero-point spectrum, is a so­
lution of a modified fluctuation equation, originally used by Einstein and 
Hopf to derive the Raleigh-Jeans law. Since the latter was recognized as un­

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM 
277
satisfactory, Einstein was led to his famous derivation of Planck's law, 
using his A and B coefficients. This result did not accommodate the zero­
point spectrum.
Boyer's revision of Einstein's derivation with the zero-point contribu­
tion may have been motivated by QED's compelling requirements of lend­
ing operational physical significance to the zero-point infinities of vacuum.
In the previous sections it has been shown, however, that there are finite 
alternatives to some "infinite" QED processes. In the light of these facts, 
we therefore choose the option of siding with Einstein, with regret for not 
using Boyer's ingenious derivation. This decision is here based on the 
desirability of avoiding an infinite vacuum energy that cannot be tapped.
From Copenhagen extremism of having everything discrete, to 
Boyer's 15 valiant work of reconciling Copenhagen with notions of conti­
nuity, Kiehn’slO thesis that quanta are periods on physical manifolds 
emerges as a constructive synthesis of this earlier extremism. Yet, from 
de Rham's theorem that closed forms can be constructed having assigned 
periods, to the physical fact that those periods are integral multiples of 
given basis periods (corresponding to the universal constants of nature) is a 
reduction feature that transcends de Rham's theorem.
In his further attempt at substantiating this physically indicated 
reduction to basis periods, KiehnlO calls on arguments relating to 
Brouwer's mapping theorem. Here I like to accept this reduction to basis 
periods as a feature of nature's clearly demonstrated option for counting 
identical quanta. Period reduction to multiples of universal constants 
stresses period counting, which, in turn, ties in with the generally invariant 
metric-independent aspects required for the counting tools.
By our earlier siding with Einstein, quantum uncertainty has become a 
purely environmental contingency, which is exclusively associated with 
matter. Anybody who has ever been assigned to coordinate the behavior of 
a plurality of comparable material items (say in an automated mass pro­
duction scheme) will appreciate a measure of universal relevance in the 
idea that uncertainty is exclusively an environmentally induced phe­
nomenon. We decline here to incorporate the non-material free-space of 
vacuum in that environment, because doing so yields intractable infinities.
Carrying this idea to the extreme, it would imply that an excited atom, 
isolated from the rest of the universe, would arbitrarily reside in its state 
of excitation, because there is no environment to initiate a transition. The 
idea seems akin to the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory of radiation. It 
claims that a radiation transition can take place only if there is an absorber 
recipient. This idea is relevant also to an ensemble-based derivation of the 
thermal statistics of Bose-Einstein (B-S) and Fermi-Dirac (F-D) by Tersoff 
and Bayer. 18 For Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, energy transitions are 

278
CHAPTER XVII
presumed to depend only on the emitter. The B-E and F-D statistics, by 
contrast, depend over and above on the availability of final states.
In making a comparison with standard derivations, let us be reminded 
that such derivations of B-E and F-D statistics require the mystical count­
ing artifact of reduced particle individuality. Copenhagen’s need for 
reduced particle individuality stands to reason in the light of 
Copenhagen’s silent obliteration of the distinction between 
ensemble and the single systems of which it consists.
Let us accordingly conclude that there are not two major quantum 
statistics; there are three, each with their own well-defined and distinct 
universe of discourse.
(1) A Fermi-Dirac statistics, where every state is exclusive.
(2) A Bose-Einstein statistics, where states are not exclusive; objects 
can accumulate in the same state.
(3) A Schroedinger-Planck statistics, which is nonthermal. It relates 
to phase and orientation disorder prior to (1) and (2).
Number (3) is the fateful nonclassical statistics of Copenhagen. It has 
now been made classical by virtue of the identification of its universe of 
discourse in the form of phase-and-orientation data of the plurality of en­
semble constituents. Einstein's objection "God does not play dice" was in 
opposition against a statistics pertaining to a single object.
It has been argued that Einstein changed his conviction about the role of 
statistics in physics as a result of the 1925 quantum revolution. Einstein had 
great expertise in statistical matters. His fluctuation theory (Brownian mo­
tion) and his derivation of Planck's law of radiation on the basis of the con­
cepts of spontaneous and induced emission are still today cornerstones of 
that discipline. It seems unlikely that he would have distanced himself 
from these earlier achievements with his pronouncement: "God does not 
play dice." We may well assume that this expression of Einstein's feelings 
was intended to target a single-system statistics, which was taken to exist in 
Nature, a prioril
This message indicates that some existing extremist trends in statistics 
can be brought to a synthesis by finding a universe of discourse. Without 
that universe of discourse, physics is forced to operate on a set of religious 
ground rules, which invite over-abstract procedures. Contemporary theory 
testifies to this development. The ensuing reluctance in making visual im­
ages in the micro-domain reinforced a belief in point-particles.
The reluctance of endowing point-particles with a domain of spatial 
presence thus led to the complementary act of endowing surrounding space 
with the calculation expedients of energy infinities. QED normalization 
became the method of processing these infinities to obtain finite and physi­
cally meaningful answers. Viewing these results shows that the power of 
religious-type abstractions in physics are not to be underestimated as an 

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
279
important and viable means. Yet, once established, religious conventions 
are also hard to shake.
The tenacity of religious convictions in physics is vividly illustrated by 
the enduring thesis of magnetic charge. Experiments have given a 
resounding "NO" in response to its hypothesized existence. Yet the 
theorists are not convinced; they have not even been swayed by the 
magnetic monopole's incompatibility with the law of Aharonov-Bohm and 
the latter's many relevant applications in physics. For over half a century, 
differential topology has been able to provide proof of the incompatibility 
of the magnetic monopole hypothesis and the law of Aharonov-Bohm. 
Ironically, this A-B law is, even today, viewed with greater suspicion than 
the imagined magnetic monopole, despite experimental proof to the 
contrary!
To the extent that topology-related arguments have been able to play a 
role in this controversy, they have been received with commentary ques­
tioning such thinking, because it does not fit the contemporary mold of a 
discrete world of physics. There are extremists in the Copenhagen School, 
who no longer accept the existence of a continuous and differentiable 
spacetime as a physical reality. An appeal to differential topology and 
theorems of de Rham is accordingly sidetracked and the search for 
monopoles continues.
These religious undertones of modem quantum mechanics cannot avoid 
a multidenominational diversity. We have to live with that diversity, if we 
want to have a platform from which further realistic decisions can be 
made. Fear of diversity in scientific opinion easily leads to domination by 
extremists guarding their brand of faith. Of course, proliferation of 
diversity also can adversely affect the quality of science. It is a chance that 
needs to be taken. There is little virtue in dictating a single version of 
truth. Sometimes, even ill-advised courses of action yield useful results, 
despite the fact that they were initiated for the wrong reasons. Let us admit 
that serendipity as been a major factor, especially in the development of 
quantum mechanics.
Einstein was keenly aware of this diversity of motivations driving his 
fellow physicists. 19 In a tribute to Planck, he gave us rare insight into the 
humanity of his times (chapter XV). He portrays Planck as chosen by 
God's angel and as a colleague loved for his sincerity of motivation.
What better testimony do we need that intellectual prowess alone can not 
bring the grace of bliss, unless it comes with the matching wisdom that 
goes with a pure heart.

280
CHAPTER XVII
10. Measurement Theory
A statistical theory of measurement was initiated by Gauss for the pur­
pose of developing well-defined ideas of errors and limits of precision in 
the art of surveying the surface of the earth. The techniques developed by 
Gauss subsequently found a fertile domain of application in physics in gen­
eral. A new element entered the picture with the fateful distinction made 
by the Copenhagen interpretation between classical and nonclassical statis­
tics. The so-called quantum statistics of Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, 
though, still formally belong in the classical realm, because they have rea­
sonably well-defined universes of discourse. They, after all, emerged 
prior to the nonclassical function statistics of Copenhagen.
The recognition of a quantum theory of measurement, as something dis­
tinct from standard measurement theory, emerged for the first time with 
the acceptance of the Copenhagen interpretation and its presumed nonclas­
sical connotation of the function statistics. On the other hand, if, in the 
spirit of an ensemble interpretation, a phase-and-orientation-based universe 
of discourse is recognized as relevant to the function statistics of the 
Schroedinger equation, then the idea of a separate quantum theory of mea­
surement becomes somewhat of a nonissue. Only typical quantum features 
have to be recognized in the statistical counting. The Bose-Einstein and the 
Fermi-Dirac laws testify to such needed modifications. In the previous 
section, it was already recognized that those two statistical laws needed to 
be supplemented with a Schroedinger-Planck type statistics accounting for 
the feature of element orientation and element phase in the ensemble.
Yet, not recognizing the viability of a Schroedinger-Planck statistics, 
there is no end to the chain of arguments that can be brought to bear by 
carrying the Copenhagen single-system extrapolation ad absurdum. They 
are all predicated by giving the Schroedinger equation a bigger-than-life 
absolute stature of perfection, as behooving any gift from heaven. Seen in 
this perspective, it becomes understandable why Schroedinger was uncom­
fortable with the magic power assigned to his equation by the followers of 
the Copenhagen School. A famous example of absurdity has been provided 
by Schroedinger himself, yet his tongue-in-cheek wit may have escaped 
some followers.
Assuming, solely for the sake of argument, that the Schroedinger wave 
equation can argue the (quantum) state of a single cat being dead or alive, 
one encounters troubles with the notion of probability. The poor housepet 
might be pronounced to be half-dead or half-alive. Most of us are used to 
thinking of dead and alive as a purely binary state. It is either one or the 
other; no civil administration or hospital would let us get away with 
decision-making based on the idea that a person is only a little bit dead or a 
little bit alive. The same holds for a cat.

ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE INDETERMINISM
281
Now, going a little step further by considering, instead of one cat, an 
ensemble of cats, the probability of finding a cat alive or dead makes 
perfect sense. Schroedinger's "cat" could be taken as one of the compelling 
arguments in support of an ensemble interpretation, if we were willing to 
accept that Schroedinger's equation would indeed be applicable to the 
"quantum state" of life and death. We may safely assume that Schroedinger 
would hardly have been inclined to so extend the realm of applicability of 
his equation, yet we can’t be quite so sure whether some Copenhageners 
might not go a step further than Schroedinger.
If our memory serves us well, there have been instances where people 
have considered a wave function for the whole world, or even the universe. 
If the whole universe has a wave function, why not a cat, or a human 
being? John S. Bell never was at ease with those ideas; he felt that kind of 
talk was blasphemous.
Much standard lore of quantum measurement theory has, of course, 
started with the notion of single-system uncertainty. The latter can be 
made plausible by noting that no single (atomic) particle can be individu­
ally observed without substantially disturbing its position and momentum. 
Yet the fact that such disturbances are of the order as inferred from 
Schroedinger's equation does not justify a summary identification of the 
two. The nonclassical label becomes here an easy, and therefore tempting 
opportunity in support of the single-system extrapolation. Once there is a 
mind-set to confirm a preconceived situation, an amazing amount of mate­
rial can be brought to bear to substantiate the chosen preconceptions.
A more educational perspective, though, is obtained by realizing that 
modes of measurements exist that completely circumvent the uncertainty 
rationale. The Schroedinger-Planck statistics, responsible for the uncer­
tainty phenomena, is absent in the wholly ordered situations of the 
Josephson AC effect and the quantum Hall effect. They give the most 
reproducible measurements of the h and e quanta available today.
In both cases, a dynamic-ordered situation prevails, which is continu­
ously observed. One would be hard put indeed to explain how these mea­
surements disturb the dynamics of the situation that is being scrutinized. In 
the Josephson case, a potential and frequency are measured with great pre­
cision. The potential is required to bring about the oscillation between two 
distinct quantum states. In the quantum Hall effect, the ratio of transverse 
potential and forward current are measured. Their magnitudes may vary, 
yet their ratio is constant in the plateau domains. The observed Hall 
impedance is characteristic of the cyclotron dynamics. That dynamics is 
not affected whether the lattice of cyclotron states travels faster or slower, 
within the chosen plateau range. In fact, in both cases the dynamics is 
ironically the same, whether or not measurements are made.

282
CHAPTER XVII
These new macroscopic quantum effects show up the deficiencies in the 
old lore of quantum reasoning. They are precipitating needed changes in 
the metaphors of understanding. The major change argued in this chapter is 
a transition from Copenhagen's absolute a priori single-system uncertainty 
to an ensemble-based relative uncertainty. Now in retrospect, it would have 
been possible to make this long story short, if, right from the start, we had 
considered that an absolute single-system uncertainty somehow does not sit 
well with the special theory of relativity.
What is the frame of reference with respect to which an absolute uncer­
tainty can be established? Such reference must itself have an absolute char­
acter to secure the possibility of establishing an absolute uncertainty. The 
existence of a reference of this kind, however, militates against the princi­
ples of relativity. By contrast, the notion of an ensemble-based uncertainty 
elegantly circumvents these absolute frame predicaments, because the 
ensemble uncertainty does not need an absolute reference. The ensemble 
uncertainty is a mutual uncertainty between ensemble constituents. Hence, 
the crutch of an absolute reference is not needed and can, therefore, be 
avoided. This compatibility argument has no doubt floated around in the 
minds of many. If it did not make the grade, it merely proves to what 
extent the prevailing physics consensus has given up reconciling relativity 
and quantum mechanics.

CHAPTER XVIII
THE DIFFEO-4 MANDATE OF MICHELSON-SAGNAC
1. Objective and Synopsis
The first impression of a discussion of the Michelson-Morley and 
Sagnac experiments in the context of a reprogramming of quantum 
mechanics is bound to raise questions about the conceptual connection of 
these topics. The answer is simply that the principle of general covariance, 
when taken in a global context, ties them together. In this chapter, it is 
shown how an old dichotomy can be removed by treating both experiments 
from a global point of view. This global spacetime treatment cannot be 
well accomplished without honoring the principle of general covariance. 
Since the same principle has also enabled us to delineate a two-tier view of 
quantum mechanics (chapters XV; XVII), the conceptual relation between 
these topics may now no longer be as far-fetched as they initially appeared.
The Michelson-Morley null-experiments historically led to the discov­
ery of the Lorentz transformations, because they, and not the Galilei trans­
lations, could account for the observed null-results. Subsequently, Sagnac's 
experiment showed, however, how Galilei rotations could account for a 
nonzero observation for rotating interferometers.
A global approach to interferometer performance, using cyclic integra­
tion of ray paths, permits a common analytical treatment of Michelson- 
Morley and Sagnac-type interferometers. This step from local to global 
procedures leads to the surprising result that both experiments can be 
accounted for by general Galilei transformations, which, in the spirit of 
Chasles' theorem, cover translations and rotations both.
Essential for obtaining this joint result is the choice of a global proce­
dure taking the place of experimenting with local options of velocity addi­
tion. Far from sounding a retreat from relativity, this joint treatment gives 
general covariance priority over Lorentz covariant formulations. Two 
classical experiments show how Diffeo-4, as used in the general theory of 
relativity, takes precedent over L(4). The special theory's restriction to 
uniform translations, in conjunction with an overemphasis on a local con­
ceptualization of velocity addition, have stood in the way of a common 
treatment of the two experiments.
283

284
CHAPTER XVIII
Conclusion: The Michelson-Morley experiment may not be taken as a 
compelling and unique path to the Lorentz group, yet Michelson and 
Sagnac's experiments together give joint evidence, making Diffeo-4 quite 
compelling.
2. Introduction
The general policy of contemporary physics vis-a-vis its principles of 
invariance has been dominated by a contradictory thesis. On the one hand, 
Lorentz invariance has been taken to rule supreme in physics; Dirac equa­
tions and quantum electrodynamics are believed to have, among others, 
provided ample evidence to support such a position. On the other hand, 
there is this remaining, half silent lipservice to an ill-formulated 
Kretschmann-Bridgman doctrine (chapter XV;3), which claims (on 
incomplete epistemological grounds) that a principle of general covariance 
cannot be expected to have compelling physical implications.
How do we resolve this obvious contradiction? If the Lorentz group 
holds a major position in the Diffeo-4 hierarchy of invariances, as indeed it 
does, one ought to be very reluctant in declaring the Diffeo-4 requirement 
as void of any necessary physical implications. The word earlier men­
tioned, as holding an answer to this predicament, is the hierarchy concept 
of invariances. This hierarchy feature has been traditionally underem­
phasized in the literature, a circumstance that has led to simplifying, all- 
encompassing, blanket statements such as: all laws of physics have to be 
Lorentz invariant, or Einstein's presumed more radical position; all laws of 
nature have to be invariant under general spacetime substitutions: Diffeo-4. 
Instead, it is the Principle of Invariance Hierarchy, discussed in chapter 
XIV;4, which can restore some logic order in statements that otherwise ap­
pear as dogmatically imposed requirements.
Kretschmann and Bridgman had already sounded a retreat from a 
blanket imposition of Diffeo-4 invariance. In fact, it wnt from blanket 
imposition to blanket retreat. Continuing in their vein of criticism, one 
could equally infer that in some cases a blanket imposition of Lorentz 
invariance does not make sense either. What purpose would be served by 
insisting on an explicit Lorentz invariant rendition, say, of the very 
fundamental laws of crystal symmetries?
The fact that all crystal symmetries are subgroups of the rotation group 
0(3) obviates the need for wider invariance. The process, as is, could be 
said to meet Lorentz invariance, by virtue of rotations being a subgroup of 
the Lorentz group. However, if spatial crystal symmetries were to be ex­
tended by time reversals, 0(3) would no longer be adequate. Seen in this 
perspective, the Kretschmann-Bridgman criticism thus becomes a 
premature rejection ensuing from a subjective restriction of physical per­
spective on the part of its authors. Avoiding such subjectivism, the physical 

THE DIFFEO-4 MANDATE OF MICHELSON-SAGNAC
285
implications of the hierarchy of transformation groups should be given a 
needed attention.
Diagram II of Diffeo-4 decompositions shows two disjoint sequences of 
subgroups that have no mutual intersections, except the unit element. Yet, 
all these subgroups hold important positions in contemporary physics. 
Their property of being subgroups of Diffeo-4 is their most striking 
common characteristic.

This places Diffeo-4 in a unique position for acquiring a common per­
spective on procedures of contemporary physics. Continued adherence to 
the Kretschmann-Bridgman suggestion of pragmatically restricting the 
mathematical ambition for creating invariant descriptions would unfor­
tunately bereave us of such a perspective.
3. The Michelson and Sagnac Experiments
In the last part of the Nineteenth Century, Michelson started doing 
experiments to establish the possible existence of an "aether" wind. He 
used several interferometer designs. In some, the beam path looped around 
a finite surface area; in others the beam path folded on itself going back 
and forth without enclosing a net surface area to speak of. Later designs, 
in cooperation with Morley, led to multiple-beam traversals for the 
purpose of enhancing the sensitivity of the device.
The outcome of these experiments led to smaller and smaller values for 
the aether wind that could not have escaped observation. Since no clearly 
measurable fringe shifts could be observed, even while the threshold sensi­
tivity was well below the circumferential or even the orbital velocities of 
the earth, the aether wind was taken to be zero.
The expected fringe shifts had been calculated, based on a premise of 
local Galilean additivity of velocities c±v, with one of the components 
equalling the light velocity c. Since the experiments contradicted this 

286
CHAPTER XVIII
premise, Lorentz first formally resolved the predicament by introducing a 
new kinematics, which was to replace the old Galilean kinematics, at least 
in electromagnetic situations. Physics thus became endowed with two types 
of kinematics: Galilei kinematics in mechanics, and a Lorentz kinematics in 
electromagnetism.
This dichotomous situation was subsequently resolved by Einstein by 
also bringing mechanics in line with electromagnetics. Newtonian mechan­
ics thus became replaced with what is now normally referred to as "rela­
tivistic mechanics." It is a mechanics, covering uniform and nonuniform 
motion, as viewed from an inertial frame of reference. By 1920 the 
observable physical consequences of this mechanics (e.g., the mass-energy 
theorem and the hydrogen fine structure), had helped to consolidate its 
relevance. Einstein's bold initiative literally had rescued the conceptual 
unity of physics.
However, between 1910 and 1920, something happened to disturb the 
peace of mind of a sizable number of people. Sagnac1 made an inter- 
feromer with a beam loop enclosing a finite area, such as had been used 
earlier by Michelson. Yet, instead of making observations on a slowly ro­
tating and orbiting earth, Sagnac placed the interferometer on a much 
faster moving turntable. This time there was no longer a null-result. The 
experiments showed a fringe shift proportional to the rotation rate of the 
turntable and proportional to the surface area enclosed by the beam path.
In earlier experiments, Michelson had no observable result, which was 
presumably due to the rate of rotation of the earth as being too small to 
register for the experimental sensitivity of that time. The orientation of 
the device with respect to direction of rotation also played a role. Sagnac's 
turntable thus saved the day for Michelson's earlier null-results. Later, in 
cooperation with Gale, Michelson showed how also the rotation of the earth 
could be measured by such an interferometric device, provided the area 
enclosed by the beam path is big enough. Today, small size ring-laser 
versions of the Sagnac interferometer easily measure the earth rate of 
rotation. These ring-laser devices compete with mechanical gyros and they 
have become powerful aids in inertial navigation.
At this point, the burning question is: How did Sagnac calculate the 
fringe shift observed with his interferometer? The answer: He used the 
Galilean addition theorem c±v, which had just been outlawed by Lorentz 
and Einstein. As is to be expected, the outcome of the Sagnac experiment 
caused a measure of upheaval, which was ultimately resolved by Einstein 
and von Laue by stressing the uniqueness of the uniform motion covered 
by the Lorentz group.
The upshot of these deliberations may be summarized as follows: It is 
impossible to detect, by intrinsic means, an absolute state of uniform 
translation, yet a state of absolute rotation is detectable and that is exactly 

THE DIFFEO-4 MANDATE OF MICHELSON-SAGNAC
287
what the Sagnac experiment does. The position of the Lorentz transforma­
tion now became clearly delineated as a tool to be used solely when interre­
lating the family of inertial frames. Hence, strictly speaking, the Lorentz 
group is not applicable to the Michelson-Morley experiment; it is, at best, 
asymptotically acceptable.
Yet, an asymptotic validity does not quite suffice for resolving a matter 
of fundamental principle. This marginal logical consistency still causes 
many to retain lingering doubts as to why the Galilean addition of veloc­
ities (which is invalid for uniform translation) suddenly needs 
reinstatement for rotation, or as soon as there is a deviation from uniform 
motion. This ad hoc change in the rules of velocity addition seemed a 
beauty defect of the special theory of relativity. The next section shows 
how a global Diffeo-4 assessment of the interferometric function removes 
this conceptual discontinuity between uniform and nonuniform motion.
4. A Global View of Interferometric Path-Length Changes
Since Michelson and Sagnac interferometers are used to determine the 
absence or presence of states of motion of the interferometer as a whole, it 
must be considered as essential that the instrument be regarded as a rigid 
body. The condition is obvious, because, if this requirement were not met, 
one would measure all sort of fringe shifts (or frequency shifts for ring 
lasers) due to deformations of the equipment itself. Since forces of accel­
eration can bring about path-length changes and corresponding fringe shifts 
or beat frequency readings, a near-perfect rigidity of the equipment is a 
sine qua non for making observations about the presumed aether-wind.
An epistemologically reduced role for the Lorentz transformation now 
is almost unavoidable, because rigidity under the Lorentz group does not 
really exist. All of this is indicative that concepts such as Lorentz contrac­
tion are to be considered as apparent, not as real, manifestations.
A global assessment of interferometric behavior is, in essence, an 
investigation of the interrelation of changes in the time and spatial 
components of the spacetime phase integral taken between the spacetime 
points of comparison 1 and 2

CHAPTER XVIII
In the Michelson-Sagnac case we need to evaluate the changes in the 
components of this integral due to the changes induced by a one-parameter 
spacetime group
dqv = v^dr .

Operating with this group on the integral of Eq.l gives 
2

which is the sum of two integrals. The first of these integrals gives the 
changes in the integrand and the second gives the effect of changes in the 
path of integration as a result of the group operation. The change in 
integration domain is here accounted for as a change in the integrand by 
using the so-called "Lie derivative £" with respect to the generating vector 
V
v of the group Eq.2 operating on the one-form defined by k v. In an 
explicit tensorial rendition the Lie operation becomes ;2

Since the light ray obeys the Hamilton equations of motion, the first term 
in Eq. 4 vanishes. This "equation of motion" for light rays is also known 
as the Sommerfeld-Runge law^

which is in a form to be transcribed in terms of its time and space compo­
nents co and k.
For a continuous transition between uniform and accelerated motion, 
the Galilean option is needed for the group defined by Eq.2; shown in 
diagram II as Gu(3,l) -» Gd(3,l). It means dT = dt so that v°' = (1;v). 
Using Eq.2 the spatial components of the integrated part of Eq.6 are hereto 
rewritten as an integral with respect to group parameter r-»t integrated 
over the period T of light circulation in the loop:
T
<54> = <5co T + pk-dr + codT + jk-vdt.

The time integral over the period T can be converted in a spatial loop

integral, because the spatial line element ds=cdt, with c the vacuum light 
velocity. One thus obtains
J 
« ,
Jk-vdt = - <£v-dr. 
8
In the context of the interferometer, the modulus k=lkl of the spatial vector 
k is a constant, and so is c, which means they can be taken out of the inte­
gral. Since k and dr are, by definition, in the same spatial direction, the 
scalar multiplication v-dr can replace k-v.
Eq. 8 can now be written in the form
k
<5<t> = t + |5k-dr + co<5T + - fv-dr, 
9
which finally lends itself to physical interpretation.
Assuming the motion-induced changes in interferometric conditions to 
be adiabatic in nature, <S<t> = 0 may be taken as a spacetime invariant crite­
rion of adiabaticity. Since the Michelson- and Sagnac-type interferometers 
operate with a fixed frequency monochromatic light source, one further 
assumes <5 co = 0. There is no change in the time of circulation T in a closed 
loop of the undisturbed interferometer; <ST = O. The integral 2rr^k-dr 
defines the number of nodes Z in the closed loop light path, so that the 
fringe shift per single loop is <5Z = 2'n’$<5k‘dr. Substitution in Eq.9 gives, 
after using the free-space wave length Ao = 2rr/]k|, the fringe shift 
expression per loop:
|<5Z| = (cA0)fv-dr . 
10
The corresponding frequency shift <5 co in the ring-laser mode of 
operation follows from the condition <5Z = 0. The result equals
|<5co|= ^v-dr / c|ds, 
10a
and obtains directly from the adiabatic type relation -5Z/Z= <5co/co. The 
integral f ds is the path length of the loop.
Mindful of the earlier-stated rigidity requirement, it is now useful to 
consider a kinematic theorem due to Chasles,4 which says that any arbi­
trary rigid-body motion can, at any moment, be decomposed into a super­
position of a translation and a rotation:
v = u + r * Q . 
11
In Eq.ll, the symbol v represents the general motion of the rigid body, u 
is the purely translational component, r is the radius vector of the point 
where v is locally observed, and 0 is the vector rate of rigid body rota­
tion. Since the body is taken to be in rigid motion, Q is defined as a con­

290
CHAPTER XVIII
stant for the complete spatial realm of the interferometer under considera­
tion. Since curlu=0, a little algebra yields the familiar relation:
curlv = 20. 
12
The essence of the transition from Eq. 11 to Eq. 12 rests in the fact that 
Eq. 12 lifts the global information out of the local Eq.ll.
Applying Stokes' theorem to Eq. 10, and using Eq. 12, one obtains
6Z = 2(cA0)-1 JJ Q-dA . 
13
A
The A in Eq. 13 represents the surface area enclosed by the beam path, 
which is the integration path of Eq.9.
The familiar Sagnac result follows if the totality of enclosed area can be 
denoted by a single surface vector A, and after multiplying by 2 to account 
for the double loop comparison between clock- and counterclock-wise 
loops. The Q being constant throughout the interferometer equipment may 
thus be taken out of the integration process, which then yields Sagnac's ob­
served result:
Z= 4Q*A/(cA0). 
14
This Sagnac process (i.e., the laser variations thereof) presently pro­
vides the basis for the most sensitive devices for sensing absolute rotations. 
When operated in the form of a ring laser, its sensitivity is capable of de­
tecting 10*5, or better, of the relatively slow earth-rate of rotation. Note 
how Eq.9 is starting point for ring laser device and interferometer.^
Keeping in mind that Galilei addition of velocities is still the standard 
tool for obtaining Eq. 14, the thought is justified to reconsider somewhat 
the standard conceptual framework surrounding the Lorentz group, the 
Galilei group, and the Michelson-Morley and Sagnac experiments. The 
here chosen path of relating Eq.14 to the loop integral Eq.9 provides a 
common umbrella for discussing both null-results and finite results.
Two major factors are now instrumental in the decision of whether or 
not the integral
$ v-dr=Jj' curlv-dA
C| 
A
vanishes. One has to do with the beam-enclosed area A. It is determined 
by the interferometer design and depends on how the integration loop q 
bounds a net surface area A. The other major factor is contingent on the 
type of motion itself to which the device is submitted. The integrand v or 
rather curlv is the determining factor. The just-mentioned factors instru­
mental for the value of integral |v-dr lead to a number of conclusions that 
are unorthodox, when seen in the perspective of somewhat distorted, yet 
prevailing, opinions about relativity.

THE DIFFEO-4 MANDATE OF MICHELSON-SAGNAC
291
The simple Michelson-Morley interferometer qualifies as a zero (beam- 
enclosed) area design, because the beams travel back and forth, tracing the 
same path. Yet a possible exception may have to be made for some of the 
later designs with multiple-beam traversals; depending on design detail, 
they may enclose small residual areas. For that reason, they could give 
nonzero results, where zero results were expected.
However, assuming the enclosed area to be zero, it follows:
The ideal Michelson-type interferometer of zero enclosed beam path 
area should give a null result regardless of whether its motion is a uniform 
translation, a rotation, or both.
In the spirit of Chasles theorem, this covers arbitrary rigid body motion 
in a Galilean sense. This null property of the traditional Michelson inter­
ferometer is, in retrospect, a fortunate circumstance indeed, because it led 
to the discovery of the Lorentz and conformal groups (see diagram II in 
this chapter).
Modem inertial navigation devices are known to be capable of measur­
ing very small fractions of an earth rate of rotation, well into the range of 
orbital rates. Since these small rates of rotation are now measurable with 
Sagnac-based ring-laser devices, the customarily suggested exclusive rela­
tionship between the Michelson-Morley experiment and the special theory 
of relativity are now no longer in order.
After almost a century of teaching how Lorentz transformation are es­
sential in explaining the Michelson-Morley null result, the amazing feature 
of the present discussion is the total absence of any explicit reference to the 
Lorentz group. Some further thought, then, reminds us that the exclusive 
bond between translation and Lorentz group makes the joint treatment of 
Michelson's null result and Sagnac's nonzero result impossible.
How does relativity get into the picture? Since the physical relevance of 
the Lorentz group is backed by impressive evidence, the cited situation is 
not to be regarded as grist for the mill of those who don't like the theories 
of relativity. It may be necessary, though, to give the Lorentz group a 
more abstract role in physics than is presently fashionable. The principal 
question, at this juncture, centers around the Diffeo-4 premise that goes 
into a derivation of the universal fringe shift formula, here given by 
Eq. 13. Comparative derivations of this expression, covering the more gen­
eral case of refracting media in the beam path, have been discussed in 
ref. 5.
The starting point for an expression involving the loop integral j>v-dr 
remains, however, a spacetime form of the Hamilton principle for the 
trajectories of light beams. The optical wave equation leads, in the 

292
CHAPTER XVIII
geometric optical limit, to the Hamilton equations of motion. The latter 
assume in the case of light rays, a form which is referred to by Poeverlein^ 
as the Sommerfeld-Runge law: curlk=0, where k is the wave vector. The 
corresponding expression for a material particle of momentum p is 
curlp=0. In chapter VI, Eq. 10, it is shown how Einstein inferred the one- 
form (E; p) to be closed, thus establishing the period-integral nature of the 
Bohr-Sommerfeld integrals. Here, it determines the 1-form (co;k) as a 
closed form.
The integral of the Hamilton principle becomes, through the use of a 
Legendre transformation, a spacetime line integral, which is then subjected 
to the one-parameter (nonlinear) Galilei group (dr= vdT; dt = d,v). Since a 
general invariant treatment is implied by the variation treatment of the 
Hamilton integral, the result obtained acquires a measure of validity in the 
realm of the general theory of relativity. In fact, no spacetime metric has 
an explicit role in these considerations; therefore, the procedure is still 
metric-independent at this point. Here is a case in point, earlier cited by 
Birss (chapter VI), the spatial metric is essential for the end result, not the 
spacetime metric.
By recognizing that the general theory of relativity, with or without a 
metric, is the realm of operation for discussing the here-mentioned 
Michelson and Sagnac experiments, the conceptual situation is found to be 
closer to a resolution. Yet, that very fact creates a new hurdle, because 
modem renditions of the general theory are almost exclusively gravity- 
oriented. The principle of general covariance, originally one of the 
cornerstones of Einstein's theory, has these days been reduced to a 
nonphysical status. If this principle is reinstated, diagram II can help to 
reconcile the Galilei-Lorentz controversy. It shows the Lorentz group and 
the linear as well as the nonlinear Galilei groups as subsets of the set of 
general (i.e., linear and nonlinear) spacetime coordinate substitutions, or, 
in modem jargon, the set of spacetime diffeomorphisms: Diffeo-4.
While it is not essential at this point to discuss these matters with the 
help of a spacetime metric, there is no objection against using a metric­
based argument. The spacetime metric is an invariant under the Lorentz 
group, but not under the Galilei group. Langevin^ was the first to show 
how it is exactly the noninvariance of the metric under Galilei 
rotations which explicitly leads to the Sagnac effect.
5. Conclusion and History
The unified Diffeo-4 rendition of the Michelson and Sagnac observa­
tions now emerges as a striking example how physics has shortchanged it­
self in the past by following prematurely the advice of a "covariance-re­
jecting" pragmatism. Instead of making things simpler by avoiding an 
implementation of the principle of general covariance, matters became 

THE DIFFEO-4 MANDATE OF MICHELSON-SAGNAC
293
more complicated by not giving the principle a chance to demonstrate its 
coordinating potential. Another compounding factor has been the establish­
ment's predilection for cure-all local approaches versus an inadequate per­
ception for situations calling for global approaches.
The coordinating function of general covariance manifests itself in the 
principle's ability to remove disturbing dichotomies in standard discus­
sions. Here is a list of instances encountered in these chapters that may be 
said to have profited from a contextual revival of general covariance in 
conjunction with options for global description. Here are major instances 
where general covariance (referred to as Diffeo-4) shows its virtue:
1. Diffeo-4 procedures invite distinctions between metric-dependent and 
metric-independent descriptions.
2. Diffeo-4 procedures invite distinctions between local and global de­
scriptions by revealing unique global features of pre-constitutive funda­
mental law.
3. In the light of the delineations given under 1 and 2, the principle now 
permits an enunciation of metric-independent Diffeo-4 quantum-laws in the 
form of period-integrals.
4. The obstacles encountered in converting the Dirac equations into a 
Diffeo-4 form now become understandable, as having been invited by an 
inappropriate Diffeo-4 imposition for ensemble-based situations.
5. A Diffeo-4 global approach permits a unified description of the 
Micheson-Morley and Sagnac experiments.
A word of criticism is in order about the original wording of the prin­
ciple of general covariance. The goal was stated as meaning that locally 
Diffeo-4 conditions were to be imposed on all physical laws. Stated in this 
form, the principle's use is contingent on a definition of physical law. The 
principle of invariance hierarchy (chapter XV; 4) helps here to home in on 
Diffeo-4 eligibility.
Diffeo-4 laws are taken as fundamental if they no longer retain consti­
tutive specifics pertaining to the media to which they apply. The four- 
field (E,D,B,H) Maxwell equations belong in that category, and so do the 
quantum counting period integral laws of chapter VI. The two-field (E,H) 
Maxwell equations don't belong in that category, because they invoke pa­
rameters related to the spacetime metric. The metric-tensor indeed defines 
the constitutive properties of spacetime. The gravitational field equations, 
which postulate a proportionality of the energy-momentum tensor and a 
differential concomitant of the metric tensor, qualifies as medium indepen­
dent if the gravitational constant of relativity can be taken to be a universal 
constant similar to e and b.
A different situation prevails for the laws that directly describe the 
physical properties of a medium. Pierre Curie has said, in the context of 
piezo-electricity, c'est 1'assymetrie qui fait 1'effect! meaning that only the 

294
CHAPTER XVffl
absence of certain symmetries cause a medium to display certain effects. 
For instance, inversion symmetry rules out piezo-electricity. Since wider 
symmetry reduces the number of possible effects, there is this glimpse of 
truth to early Kretschmann? and Bridgman^ criticism (chapter XVI) of the 
principle of covariance, when seen from the angle of constitutive law. 
However, that would be wrongly applying Diffeo-4 (numerical) invariance, 
because the encompassing set of all conceivable symmetries would effec­
tively rule out all local constitutive effects. Indeed, from this angle, Diffeo- 
4 numerical invariance could not have any physical consequences.
Yet, by the same token, as earlier observed, Diffeo-4 form invari­
ance can distinguish locally a primordial pre-constitutive state of physical 
law prior to media specifics, say, the Maxwell equations. Here, form­
invariance takes precedent over numerical-invariance. This distinction is to 
be regarded as a first step for homing in on the organizational feature 
alluded to in Einstein's response^ to Kretschmann?
Since imposing local Diffeo-4 numerical invariance becomes, indeed, a 
trivial operation, the only nontrivial Diffeo-4 numerical invariances are 
necessarily global in nature. The period integrals identifying quanta and 
the cyclic integrals expressing fhix-and-charge conservation discussed in 
chapter VI are prime examples of such global laws. These integral laws 
are also characterized by their fundamental pre-constitutive form, because 
any media references are absent in those renditions.
So, bringing the Kretschman-Bridgman criticism to its logical 
conclusion we have just seen that imposing numerical Diffeo-4 invariance 
is locally trivial; yet globally, it has a way of singling out preconstitutive 
fundamental law. Mindful of the triviality of imposing locally Diffeo-4 
numerical invariance, the next question becomes: What are the nontrivial 
local results of imposing global Diffeo-4 numerical invariance on those 
integrals?
Here are some relevant answers: The global numerical Diffeo-4 invari­
ance of an integral defines how, locally, the integrand is to ” covary*’ with 
transformational changes of the elements of integration. This Diffeo-4 co­
variance of the integrand defines a tensorial quality. The covariance of 
the tensor elements is designed to retain an intrinsic property of its asso­
ciated form, which may have led to the language use why covariance is 
also referred to as form-invariance. The invariant contraction of tensor 
and integration elements defines a differential form in the sense of Cartan. 
The form is said to be "impair" if it changes sign under orientation-chang­
ing transformation of the frame of reference; if it does not change sign, it 
is said to be "pair" (compare chapter VI).
The guaranteed Diffeo-4 invariance of the Stokes and Gauss laws, now 
usually referred to as Stokes' generalized theorem, can now be called upon 

THE DIFFEO-4 MANDATE OF MICHELSON-SAGNAC
295
to define Diffeo-4 invariant operations on tensors and/or their associated 
forms. This operation, defined for arbitrary dimension, is called the exte­
rior derivative. It covers in three dimensions the familiar differential op­
erations of vector analysis known as gradient, curl and divergence.
This excursion in the land of differential invariants (with its, at times, 
confusing terminology and equally confusing connection to physics) has 
been generated by two interrelated controversies (i.e., Michelson versus 
Sagnac, and Kretschmann-Bridgman versus Einstein). Both can be resolved 
by reinstating general covariance as a physical principle and by making a 
long-overdue delineation of local and global procedures (chapter XVI).
Mindful of the conceptual pitfalls associated with the principle of gen­
eral covariance (if attending circumstances are neglected), an inquiry into 
its history is in order. The rudiments of general (form) covariance go back 
to Lagrange. A first step from space to spacetime (and general covariance) 
came about with the one-form of energy-momentum. This took place early 
last century through the Legendre transformation of Hamilton's principle. 
Sommerfeld's famous calculation of the fine structure of hydrogen in 1917 
took full advantage of a built-in spacetime Diffeo-4 invariance of the 
Hamilton-Jacobi process.
The global approach to interferometry discussed in this chapter is, in 
essence, the light-ray version of Hamilton's principle, in which the space­
time phase is the counterpart of action. Since the equations of motion 
emerge as integrability conditions of the one-form of energy-momentum, a 
metric-independent general covariant quality of the fundamental laws of 
mechanics and geometric optics are here apparent.
Kottler, Cartan, and Hargreaves have, each in his own way, focused on 
these aspects. In the Thirties, van Dantzig reiterated again how metric­
independent general invariance permeates the fundamental laws of 
electromagnetism and mechanics. All these references can be found in 
Whittaker's classic on the history of the theories of "aether." 10
In preceding chapters (e.g., chapter VI), ample evidence has been 
accumulated for the purpose of extending the cited "Whittaker testimony" 
with substantial physical evidence in the form of a set of metric-inde­
pendent period integrals, which quantize single systems and ordered 
ensembles thereof. During the past half-century, contemporary physics 
has done itself a disservice by banking solely and too exclusively on aspects 
of Lorentz invariance. As a result, distinctions between local-global and 
numerical-versus-form invariance have remained obscure. If mathematical- 
physical pragmatism was the initial justification to settle for Lorentz 
invariance, in retrospect it now appears that this restriction has extracted a 
high price in terms of having to ignore evidence that is calling out for a 
more incisive look at the role of general invariance in physics.

296 
CHAPTER XVIII
In no way is it possible to reconcile the here-cited predicaments of 
physics by persisting with the presently prevailing mathematical methods; 
fragmented as they are by local-global indecision and arbitrary choice of 
invariance options. These mathematical inadequacies compound the task of 
physical interpretation. They have been part and parcel of ad hoc nonclas- 
sical imagery and quantum mysticism. All of this has contributed to grow­
ing incoherence and undue splintering of beckoning conceptual wholeness.

EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
A summary of these exercises in quantum reprogramming carries, in 
essence, a direct and simple message for physics. The first part of this 
message says: The Schroedinger equation is a slightly less-than-perfect tool, 
notwithstanding its amazing applicability. The second part says: The 
Copenhagen interpretation is much less perfect than the less-than-perfect 
Schroedinger equation. Perhaps surprisingly, this change in assessment 
does not in the least detract from the physical relevance and usefulness of 
the Schroedinger equation. Yet, by contrast, hardly any essential physical 
role can be retained for the vague conglomerate of mysticisms that is 
known under the name of Copenhagen interpretation.
A fair number of physicists silently agree with this assessment. To this 
effect, some may even testify in public. Yet few are willing to draw 
compelling conclusions from this proven near-irrelevance of the 
Copenhagen view for a future course of action. It may not be lack of 
courage of conviction causing physics to settle for more than half a century 
of status quo, but rather a lack of clearly beckoning perspectives as to what 
is worthy of new convictions on which to build. Then in the back of many 
heads, there remains this tempting belief that contemporary quantum 
mechanics is so close to the truth that minor changes might still bring the 
whole truth.
If the introductory statement of this epilogue restores a peace of mind 
concerning the Schroedinger equation, by the same token, it totally 
removes support for the Copenhagen interpretation. So, if we really need 
an interpretation, what other view might be regarded as closer to the 
reality of the Schroedinger equation? and how does this interpretational 
change affect the totality of quantum mechanics?
The evidence presented in these reprogramming exercises identifies the 
Schroedinger equation as the tool which comes closest to describing dilute 
ensembles of randomized single systems, but not quite the isolated single­
system itself. It is this asymptotic relation between these two options, which 
has literally held physics in a prison of "uncertainty" for more than half a 
century. What made this amazing feat possible?
297

298
EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
One of the pioneers of the group assessment of quantum descriptions, 
the mathematician Herman Weyl, is cited by Morris Kline 1 as having said: 
"It was not merit but a favor of fortune when in 1923.... the spectral 
theory of Hilbert space was discovered to be the adequate mathematical in­
strument of quantum mechanics." How should we presently view Weyl's 
exquisite characterization of the 1925 quantum revolution? Since this 
quantum reprogramming started with the intention of lessening dependence 
on fortune and enhancing fact and reason, it can now be said that a better 
idea about the revolution's realm of validity is emerging, if a comparison is 
made with the early days of quantum euphoria.
From the mathematical point of view, the spectral theory of Hilbert 
spaces has done well, even without the additional stimulus of physical ap­
plicability. It is an intellectually elegant monument, a demonstration 
masterpiece, if you will, as to what the formalistic approach in mathematics 
is capable of accomplishing. When this spectral theory of Hilbert spaces 
was found to hold an important key to many quantum problems, the 
justifiable mathematical euphoria carried over into a not-so-justifiable 
physical euphoria.
Then, as frequently happens, after the initial physical euphoria subsided, 
a period of introspection follows. Quantum mechanics that was generating 
all those Hilbert spaces (i.e., the Schroedinger equation), refused to yield to 
a derivation reducing it tightly and succinctly to first principles. 
Therefore, men of conscience were, and should have been, concerned with 
the possibility of having perhaps over-invested in a prematurely presumed 
exact physical status of the Schroedinger equation. A physical exactness 
matching the mathematical exactness of the theory of Hilbert spaces became 
an appealing ideal, even if it not quite borne out by perceived reality. It 
was less the Schroedinger equation itself, but rather the nitty-gritty of its 
physical interpretation, which, through the years, retained evidence of a 
measure of conceptual incompleteness. It was this sense of incompleteness 
that literally sought a substantiation through the suspected existence of 
hidden variables. The local commitment, inherent to Schroedinger's 
method, gave those hidden variables a local basis as formulated by Bell's 
inequalities. Aspect's experiments then removed the basis for local 
relevance by not confirming Bell's inequalities.
A multitude of interpretational propositions have seen the light of day, 
without seriously affecting or, for that matter, clarifying the applicability 
range of the Schroedinger method. All of which goes to show that the 
Schroedinger method was wiser in finding its way to relevant answers than 
our efforts at understanding why it could find its way. While this seem­
ingly unerring capability of giving right answers reinforced belief in its 
magical potential, by the same token, this fact also became grist for the mill 
of the pragmatists who preached their gospel of "not to worry" about inter­

EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
299
pretations. Some pragmatists are known to use any interpretation or none 
at all, contingent on what the situation calls for.
Whenever situations arise where an interpretation is believed to be nec­
essary, then the so-called Copenhagen single-system view of Schroedinger's 
equation is found to be, by far, the most favored. This reprogramming 
identifies the Copenhagen single-system extrapolation as the major 
interpretational stumbling block in contemporary quantum mechanics. It 
also is the source of almost all quantinn mechanical mysticism. In fact, the 
single-system premise is easily the least-justified and probably the most- 
flawed premise of the Copenhagen view.
There have been many competing points of view, yet none achieved the 
prominence of the Copenhagen view. This reprogramming has homed in 
on one particular competing view; it is one that is not based on the single­
system premise. The Schroedinger equation is here taken to have an ensem­
ble connotation, a view pioneered by Popper in the Thirties. Pragmatism, 
and the already existing mystical, though workable, Copenhagen view, left 
only a lukewarm reception for the original Popper proposal. For all 
practical purposes, it was relegated to a position of just another one of 
many unessential proposals.
If nothing else, the reprogramming shows that properly chosen ensem­
ble specifications bring the Popper proposition into a revealing quantitative 
relationship with the Schroedinger equation. While this fact still does not 
establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Schroedinger equation is an 
ensemble tool, it does make the ensemble option a good deal more probable 
than the single-system option. As a remaining restraint preventing an all- 
out support of the ensemble option, one should consider that even these 
explicit quantitative relations between ensemble statistics and Schroedinger 
results still fall short of aiding in a complete derivation of the Schroedinger 
equation from first principles.
In fact, considering the lacunar nature of the derivational origin of the 
Schroedinger equation, there should be real doubt whether this equation 
will ever be derivable from first principles. After all those years of inves­
tigation and contemplation, it is more likely that Herman Weyl's words are 
to be taken more literally than ever intended: the Schroedinger equation's 
relation to Hilbert space was (and still is) "a favor of fortune."
With all reservations in place, it is thus concluded that the Schroedinger 
equation comes conceivably closest to describing dilute ensembles of 
identical single systems in quantum states that are randomized in phase and 
orientation. The word "conceivably" here conveys that there is no proof by 
derivation to completely substantiate this statement. All of this indicates 
that there is no known context for which the Schroedinger equation can be 
given a status of absolute physical exactness. The many statements to the 

300
EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
contrary in the quantum mechanical textbook literature, therefore, are to 
be regarded as the products of wishful thinking.
Overwhelmed by the equation's unparalleled success, earlier theorizing 
had always tacitly assumed an absolute and exact status for quantum me­
chanics' major tool of inquiry. Physical imagery kept drifting around on 
this magic cloud, which had brought so much "fortune" beyond what 
physics had deserved on the basis of "merit." Hence, when the Copenhagen 
interpretation became available as an intellectual vehicle for consolidating 
this equation's position of "fortune," the Copenhagen view automatically, 
yet unjustifiably, assumed the same aura of near-perfect truth that had al­
ready been identified with the Schroedinger equation and spectral theory. 
Now, in retrospect, physics should have had some real doubts that such a 
lofty assignation, even for the Schroedinger equation, might not be on 
altogether solid grounds.
In the course of this reprogramming, evidence has been compiled which 
amply supports the Popper-ensemble proposition in conjunction with a re­
quired phase-and-orientation randomness of its constituent elements. It is 
the best that can be done for the Schroedinger equation, which, inciden­
tally, is a lot better than what the textbook literature has done for the mu­
tual relation of the Schroedinger equation and the single system. The text­
book method simply postulates an interrelation between single-system and 
Schroedinger equation, and then, depending on Copenhagen-related convic­
tions, this premise is made "plausible" with mystifying statistical considera­
tions, which, until this day have not found their "universe of discourse." 
So physics is confronted with a choice between a rather classical ensemble 
statistics versus a very nonclassical single-system statistics.
An inducement for a change of heart (i.e., from nonclassical single 
system to randomized classical ensemble) was precipitated by actual limita­
tions ensuing from an indiscriminate Schroedinger treatment of certain 
macroscopic quantum phenomena that don't meet randomness criteria. This 
monograph elaborates some cases in detail. However, the literature is full 
of them, that is to say, once the mind is alerted to making the distinctions.
Confronted with the greatly enhanced physical reality of the randomized 
ensemble association of the Schroedinger equation, can it still be regarded 
as an adequate tool for an incisive description of the isolated single-system 
constituents of ensembles? A similar question holds for ensembles that no 
longer obey the randomness criteria, because they are ensembles which re­
spond as single-systems by virtue of their internal order.
The answer is that Schroedinger's equation and associated Hilbert space 
can give, at best, an asymptotic picture of what is going on at the single­
system level, sometimes less. This new state of affairs has thus been 
created by a physics-dictated change. It leads to questions as to where we 

EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
301
go in terms of a more precise mathematical description for single-systems, 
now that Hilbert space is no longer a last word.
The introductory chapter of this quantum reprogramming identifies as 
instrumental the transition from a local-global Schroedinger eigenvalue de­
scription to an ab initio global description with the help of period integrals. 
Schroedinger's process explores from the inside outwards; starting 
with the wave equation's local statement and then applying global boundary 
conditions; it is accordingly called a local-* global process. The ab initio 
global process, by contrast, explores from the outside inward and can 
yield system information well beyond that what the local-* global 
Schroedinger process needs as a prerequisite for operation. These global 
methods were mathematically brought to fruition by de Rham and Hodge 
in the Thirties. A cursory inspection of names of people involved in this 
more recent mathematical development gives an indication that physics is 
now leaving the territory of the rather strict formal mathematics of the 
spectral theory of Hilbert spaces and is entering a much more "intuitional" 
domain of mathematics.
In (differential) geometry, this so-called formal-* intuitional transition 
became a local-* global reorientation. A preoccupation with formalities of 
differential concomitants of local curvature led to a more intuitive global 
concern with topological structure, such as can be created by an integrated 
view of local curvature. Hence, from studying the trees in the forest, the 
emphasis has shifted to the forest as a whole, which ultimately would foster 
a better understanding of the individual trees in the forest.
For physics, the study of "local" curvature properties had culminated in 
the general theory of relativity. Although this theory is known to have 
global ramifications, its experimentally confirmed aspects, so far, are 
mostly local in nature. Clearly, global theorizing literally puts the theorist 
out on a limb; global methods, therefore, tend to be more intuitive than the 
approaches prevailing in the more accessible local domains.
In the course of the reprogramming, quantization has made itself defi­
nitely known as reflecting global connotations of spacetime manifold 
structure. The relation between quantization and period integration can 
hardly leave any doubt about that fact. There is a deceptive irony, though, 
in the circumstance that the global approach lends itself especially well to 
assessing "whole" structures such as particles in the microdomain. In the 
Einstein field equations, by contrast, local spacetime curvature has a domi­
nant role for the physical macrodomain.
The general theory of relativity thus remains a local theory, notwith­
standing its global perspectives. Looking at these matters in retrospect, it 
can hardly escape attention that physics now is confronted with a situation 
in which a choice must be made about the mathematical machinery neces­

sary for exploring the global realm. In making this transition towards 
period integration, physics is faced with potential ingredients for conflict, 
which could be very similar to the war that was raging in mathematics 
during the Twenties.
It was the war between Formalism and Intuitionism. Hilbert came to be 
regarded as the leader of Formalism, and Brouwer headed the Intuitionists. 
In retrospect, it may now be said that the differences in mathematical con­
victions reflected natural differences of the respective mathematical do­
mains. One or the other type of reasoning would prevail as being most ef­
fective in getting results. Unfortunately, these natural policy changes car­
ried over into the realm of personal relations.
The tension built to a point where Hilbert fired Brouwer as coeditor of 
the "Mathematische Annalen." Efforts of colleagues to avoid this con­
frontation were to no avail. Einstein, called upon to mediate, felt incapable 
of bringing the parties together. Later, he would compare this episode of 
conflict to Aristophanes' play of the "Frogs" waging war against the mice.
Of course, neither Formalism nor Intuitionism stood to gain from the 
unfortunate personal aspect of this development. Let it suffice to say that 
those who used to call themselves "intuitionists" were guilty of using 
formal-type arguments and those calling themselves "formalists" were 
guilty of using intuitional arguments. Life has many more shades and hues 
than just black and white, and those involved in this conflict knew it and 
did not have to be convinced to recognize that human reasoning can be an 
unpredictable mixture of both. In fact, the protagonists in this real-life 
drama practiced exactly such opportunism!
The Brouwer-Hilbert episode helps dispel the thought that emotions 
cannot rise to a boiling point in a supposedly logical discipline such as 
mathematics. It is the technical similarity with the present situation in 
physics, which gives physics cause to proceed with caution, combined with 
willingness to understand. Yet, circumspection should not stop or delay at­
tempts at needed change. Time will tell whether physicists are more or less 
volatile than mathematicians. Let us delineate the current situation in 
physics as contrasted against the past of mathematics.
For more than half a century, physical theory has been riding high on a 
bandwagon of one-sided abstract formalism. During that time, an intuitive 
modelling of microphysical structures was anathema. The thesis of univer­
sal uncertainty blocked the mental access to information necessary for real­
istically completing such models. It was deemed to be outside the realm of 
human knowing. Unlike the situation in mathematics, the wave of 
formalism in physics had assumed a much more radical position than in 
mathematics. Abstraction in physics had become a path of last resort. The 
romantic dictum of single-system quantum mechanical uncertainty had been 
quite effective in ascertaining this result!

EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
303
The history of physics over the past six decades testifies to a near deifi­
cation of abstraction. This purely formalistic phase in physics has lasted 
much longer than the comparable formalistic phase in mathematics, because 
the intuitive counterpart was, in fact, literally outlawed by the dictum of 
uncertainty. In mathematics, formalism and intuitionism were always 
simultaneously active in a more balanced manner, notwithstanding some of 
the terrible fights among its practitioners (e.g., the Kronecker-Cantor con­
flict and the mentioned Brouwer-Hilbert controversy).
Ironically, physics had initially made a successful attempt at globally as­
sessing quantum situations. Bohr-Sommerfeld's quantization integrals and 
Sommerfeld's famous fine-structure calculation bear witness to how 
physics had attempted an all-global approach with reasonable success. Yet, 
a decade later, this all-global method had been displaced by an eigenvalue 
compromise, which is of a mixed local-*global nature. Possible shortcom­
ings in the exact status of the Schroedinger equation had not yet loomed on 
the horizon. The mystique of uncertainty had been successful in holding 
off the determinists.
That, in a nutshell, is how Hilbert space and its spectral properties be­
came the realm of reality for the Twentieth Century physicist, almost to the 
exclusion of spacetime itself. Fortunately, the representation theory of 
groups retained a last powerful link between spacetime and Hilbert's con­
figuration space of quantum states. The group theoretical method was a 
last concession to a phenomenology of microphysical symmetry. 
Somehow, and again ironically, symmetry had been permitted to penetrate 
the fog of uncertainty shrouding microphysical structure. Weyl and 
Wigner had shown the way.
The emergence of macroscopic quantum effects, however, brought us 
back from the abstract multi-dimensional Hilbert spaces into a reality of 
more intuitive spacetime model-making. Over and above symmetry, the 
mathematical machinery instrumental for implementing greater balance 
between formal and intuitive procedures in physics must be expected to 
call, more than before, on the topology-oriented studies initiated in 
mathematics by Poincare, Brouwer, Hopf, de Rham, and Hodge.
A recognition of this new impending reality has been very difficult for 
physics. For more than half a century, it has preached the gospel of a 
quantum mechanics, in which Hilbert space became almost a sole storage 
place of fundamental physical truth. Those involved in the study of quan­
tum mechanical fundamentals have been brushing up Hilbert space for­
malisms, using group theoretical methods for finding out more about the 
spacetime structure of the objects generating the Hilbert space superstruc­
tures. There is, at this time, no real acceptance of a need to complement 
this procedure with intuitive conjecture by following in both directions the 
threads of logic interconnecting suspected cause and perceived effect. This 

304
EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
attitude is understandable in an interpretational atmosphere, which, as a re­
sult of its own premises, had been forced to restrict the rules of causality in 
the microdomain.
While the use and function of Hilbert space, as it now stands, is not to 
be underestimated, its primary role is instrumental for ensembles, not for 
single systems! The Hilbert integral equation as definer of eigenvalue sit­
uations has an ensemble connotation, because it defines the wave function 
in any point in terms of everywhere else through the process of 
integration in the physical domain (chapter XVII;8).
The Hilbert integral equation as Schroedinger equivalent has an 
inherent "smeared-out plurality" which seems out-of-context for a single 
system. The period integral assessment, by contrast, does not have this 
reflexive interconnectedness of its spatial parts, which is so characteristic 
of the Schroedinger plurality. The period integral's domain of integration 
can be shrunk unto the single (microphysical) object of observation. It is 
capable of exploring topological structure, where Schroedinger's process is 
confined to essential physical features of the ensemble constituents only.
This inability of making an adequate ensemble versus single-system 
distinction led quantum mechanics into the dead-end street of formal ab­
straction. This escape in abstraction became misleadingly acceptable. 
Getting out of this dead-end situation, the man-made fog of "uncertainty" 
needs to be lifted so that horizons become visible again. After that, a view 
of the single-system domain comes into focus, thus opening up a potential 
for the more intuitively oriented methods of topological modelling in 
actual spacetime, not Hilbert space! There is presently, at best, a general 
but vague awareness of the nature of these deficiencies in contemporary 
quantum mechanics. The existing situation of a long standing status quo 
reveals physics' reluctance in coming to grips with the cited predicament.
To illustrate this point, let us focus on a "foundations" meeting, in 
which the late John Bell attacked several quantum colleagues on their views 
about measurement theory. Bell's purpose may have been a form of shock 
therapy to break out of an impasse. He forcefully assigned his colleagues 
to categories to which they were reluctant to belong. From the eulogy for 
Bell by Kurt Gott fried, 2 it appears that, in private, Bell used to say about 
orthodox quantum mechanics: "Something is rotten in the state of 
Denmark." While Bell's offhand remark may reveal a foreboding of con­
flict, the situation, as is, does indicate the existence of a formalist- 
intuitionist predicament in physics.
It is an irony of fate that Bell, once hailed as the savior of orthodox 
quantum mechanics, does not mince words about his own doubts concern­
ing the status of the discipline he supposedly saved. One wonders whether 
he said he saved orthodox quantum mechanics (OQM), or whether those 

EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
305
who wanted OQM saved as is, said he saved OQM. It shows how careful 
one should be in accepting praise for achievement. Bell's work effectively 
took position on the issue of local hidden variables, from the single­
system angle. His later misgivings about Copenhagen vividly illustrate 
how Bell himself had not overcome the insidiousness of Copenhagen's 
single-system extrapolation. It is this inconspicuous, yet least justifiable, 
basic Copenhagen premise which keeps haunting Contemporary Orthodox 
Quantum Mechanics (COQM). Quite amazingly, the textbook 
literature hardly considers the viability of this thesis of single­
system extrapolation a point of worthwhile discussion.
Given this de facto coexistence of ensemble and single-system views of 
contemporary quantum mechanics, and mindful of the small minority status 
of the ensemble folks, the question is: Has the majority shown awareness 
for the minority point of view? One truly has to comb the literature for a 
representative answer. Let us scrutinize, for this purpose, the choice of 
language used by an authoritative source in verbalizing the quantum 
mechanical "unspeakables."
Even if it is difficult to place a label on Feynman, most people familiar 
with his work might concur that he was a highly individualistic member of 
the Copenhagen quantum mechanical majority. On p.22 of his book with 
Hibbs^ on Path Integrals in a section on Some Remaining Thoughts, one 
finds the following statement under the heading of fundamental concepts of 
quantum mechanics:____________________________________________
I "From what does uncertainty arise? Almost without doubt it arises 
from the need to amplify the effects of single atomic events to such a level 
that they may be readily observed by large systems."(Feynman Hibbs 1965)
It would seem as if Feynman and Hibbs are making a plea supporting an 
ensemble origin of uncertainty, which is exactly how Planck introduced it 
in 1913 in the guise of zero-point energy! It is also close to what Popper 
said in 1934. The difference between Feynman and Popper is in the choice 
of epistemological priorities. Feynman's QED commitments force him to 
hang on to Copenhagen's premise of single-system extrapolation. By con­
trast, Popper feels the epistemological reality of a plurality of ensemble 
constituents should be accepted!
A little further on p.22 of the Feynman-Hibbs text, it says:___________
II "It would be an interesting problem to show that 'no other' consis- 
tent interpretation can be made."_____________________________ (F-H)
This remark reveals a wishful element hiding behind their objective. 
Feynman and Hibbs are having second thoughts about the road they are 
going. If possible, they want to be reassured by a uniqueness proof to make 
sure that accommodating Copenhagen's single-system extrapolation is a 
truly deserving goal.

306
EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
A little later, on p. 23 of the F-H text we are getting closer to a more 
definitive idea about the nature of their remaining doubts. The last sentence 
of the top paragraph may well be regarded as an invitation, in the spirit of 
measurement theory, to involve the observed as well as the observer and 
his apparatus. Paraphrasing Bell's words, Feynman and Hibbs don't go to 
the blasphemous extreme of introducing a wave function for the universe, 
yet they plead for a concession. As in statement I, they speak again of 
"amplifying" the effects, to which end an "apparatus" is now invoked:_____
III "What seems to be needed is the statistical mechanics of the ampli- 
fying apparatus."__________________________________________ (F-H)
It can hardly be denied that the F-H arguments are laced with some 
wishful thoughts that somehow are reminiscent of ensemble ramifications 
hiding in the background. Their predicament seems traceable to the single­
system extrapolation. The reader might, at this point, be willing to place 
the F-H language battle with unspeakables in the perspective of a quantum­
reprogramming alternative.
Since Heisenberg and Schroedinger at least agreed on the single-system 
nature of their equivalent procedures, let us examine the Schroedinger 
recipe to his approach to trace the single-system origin and viability. 
Rather than deriving wave equations, or variations thereof, from ever- 
evasive first principles, we do better to accept instead Schroedinger's 
recipe as is, and establish what it means.
In chapter VI; 8, the Schroedinger transcription is discussed in a global 
perspective. The transition from Hamilton-Jacobi process to wave equation 
is based on de Broglie’s (E;p) = b(co:k). The latter entails an inescapable 
point-particle connotation, which has been a much too silent, man-injected 
concomitant of standard quantum mechanics. (E;p) is a vector with domain 
connotation, and (co;k) is a field vector with spacetime point association. 
One cannot equate dissimilar vector-species without impunity, and then 
expect fundamental results. The de Broglie-Schroedinger imposed point­
element, though, is a fitting and adequate abstraction for ensemble 
consideration. Situations that don't permit such point-abstractions need to 
account for the global nature of quanta with the help of period integrals.
The subsequent variational process, as used by Schroedinger, gives, in 
good Hilbert tradition, the eigenvalue extrema. Degeneracy provides 
families of solutions adjoint to distinct eigenvalues of energy and angular 
momentum. These families are ensembles with random parameters (phase 
and orientation) that are identifiable as universes of discourse of their 
statistics.
Chapter VI explains how the picture of solution degeneracy as activator 
of ensemble statistics gives only two options of interpretation: the Gibbs 
option (Copenhagen) and the real physical ensemble. The Dehmelt et al

EPILOGUE FOR EXTRAPOLATING A FAVOR OF FORTUNE
307
single-particle experiments of 1986 then conclusively put the Gibbs option 
to rest, because to reconcile their observation with the Gibbs option, 
Dehmelt et al had to take recourse to converting a single-system statistical 
motion into a perfectly circular motion.
Now, so many years later with new experimental evidence, it is under­
standable why, in 1965, Feynman and Hibbs still went out of their way to 
accommodate the single-system Gibbs option. In addition, it is now also 
more understandable why Feynman (as one of the architects of quantum 
electrodynamics) was reluctant to pull the plug on nonclassical statistics, 
even after a classical statistical derivation of the angular momentum quan­
tum number ^n(n+l) had been reproduced twice in the Feynman Lectures.
These reprogramming exercises, we hope, may now have collected 
enough evidence to finally give down to earth philosophy some benefit of 
the doubt over Copenhagen's speculation of single-system extrapolation. 
The chances of producing a uniqueness proof sanctioning this extrapolation 
have lost their momentum. Yet, before any of this can go forward, COQM 
needs to face up to its principal interpretational flaw (i.e., the untenability 
of the single-system extrapolation). Pragmatist or no pragmatist, this flaw 
has invited procedures replete with excessive mysticism. Quantum magic 
has its limitations, even if the magic ensues from what Herman 
Weyl had so appropriately called "a favor of fortune."
