File Processing in Python
●
In Python 3 text files contain UNICODE characters which are an ASCII superset;
●
There 137,439 UNICODE chars and only 128 ASCII chars;
●
UNICODE and ASCII chars are the same for the first 128 chars;
●
In most of the cases UNICODE chars are encoded in UTF-8 or UTF-32
●
open() returns a file object;
●
open(‘file_path’, ‘mode’, encoding=’enc_scheme’)
●
Mode: 
○
r -> read only 
○
w -> write only (if file exists it is overwritten)
○
a -> append (add at the end)
○
r+ -> read or write. Doesn’t create the file.
○
a+ -> read or write. If file exists it adds at the end, otherwise it creates the file
○
b -> binary mode
○
t -> text mode
