Author’s Note
Terms in bold, throughout the book, refer to entries in alphabetical
order, or to entries in the list of contents, and in the index.
Throughout this book, the word number will refer to a positive inte-
ger or whole number, unless stated otherwise.
Letters stand for integers unless otherwise indicated. 
Notice the difference between the decimal point that is on the line,
as in 1⁄8 = 0.125, and the dot indicating multiplication, above the line:
20 = 2  2  5
Divisor and factor: these are almost synonymous. Any differences are
purely conventional. As Hugh Williams puts it, if a divides b, then
“we call a a divisor (or factor) of b. Since 1 and a are always divisors
of a, we call these factors the trivial divisors (or factors) of a.”
(Williams 1998, 2)
On the other hand, we always talk about the prime factorization
of a number, because no word like divisorization exists! For this
reason, we also talk about finding the factors of a large number such
as 231 −1.
Similarly, by convention, the divisor function d(n), which is the
number of divisors of n, is never called the factor function. And so on.
The meanings of φ (n), σ(n), and d(n) are explained in the glossary.
The natural logarithm of n, the log to base e, is written as log n. This
does not mean the usual logarithm to base 10, which would be writ-
ten log10 n.
The expression 8 > 5 means that 8 is greater than 5. Similarly, 5 < 8
means that 5 is less than 8.

The expression n ≥5 (5 ≤n) means that n is greater than or equal to
5 (5 is less than or equal to n).
The expression 4 | 12 means that 4 divides 12 exactly.
The expression 4 |/ 13 means that 4 does not divide 13 exactly.
Finally, instead of saying, “When 30 is divided by 7 it leaves a
remainder 2,” it is much shorter and more convenient to write,
30  2 (mod 7)
This is a congruence, and we say that “30 is congruent to 2, mod 7.”
The expression mod stands for modulus, because this is an example
of modular arithmetic. The idea was invented by that great mathe-
matician Gauss, and is more or less identical to the clock arithmetic
that many readers will have met in school.
In clock (or modular) arithmetic you count and add numbers as if
going around a clockface. If the clockface goes from 1 to 7 only, then
8 is the same as 1, 9 = 2, 10 = 3, and so on.
If, however, the clockface goes from 1 to 16 (for example), then 
1 = 17, 2 = 18, and 3  9 = 11.
If you count in (say) 8s around the traditional clockface showing
12 hours, then your count will go: 8, 4, 12, 8, 4, 12, repeating end-
lessly and missing all the hours except 4, 8, and 12. If you count in
5s, however, it goes like this: 5, 10, 3, 8, 1, 6, 11, 4, 9, 2, 7, 12, 5, and
by the time you start to repeat you have visited every hour on the
clock. This is because 8 and 12 have a common factor 4, and but 5
and 12 have no common factor.
Mathematicians use the  sign instead of =, the equal sign, to indi-
cate that they are using modular arithmetic. So instead of saying that
prime numbers are always of the form 6n + 1 or 6n −1, because 
6n + 2 and 6n + 4 are even and 6n + 3 is divisible by 3, we can write
6n  1 (mod 6).
Most statements made in this book have no reference. Either they are
well-known, or they can be found in several places in the literature.
Even if I do know where the claim was first made, a reference is not
necessarily given, because this is a popular book, not a work of
scholarship.
However, where a result appears to be due to a specific author or
collaboration of authors and is not widely known, I have given their
xiv • Author’s Note

names, such as (Fung and Williams). If a date is added, as in (Fung
and Williams 1990), that means the reference is in the bibliography.
If this reference is found in a particular book, it is given as (Fung and
Williams: Guy).
The sequences with references to “Sloane” and an A number are
taken from Neil Sloane’s On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences,
at www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences. See also the entry in this
book for Sloane’s On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well
as the “Some Prime Web Sites” section at the end of the bibliography.
The index is very full, but if you come across an expression such as
φ(n) and want to know what it means, the glossary starting on page
251 will help.

Introduction
Prime numbers have always fascinated mathematicians. They
appear among the integers seemingly at random, and yet not
quite: there seems to be some order or pattern, just a little below
the surface, just a little out of reach.
—Underwood Dudley (1978)
Small children when they first go to school learn that there are two
things you can do to numbers: add them and multiply them. Addi-
tion sums are relatively easy, and addition has nice simple proper-
ties: 10 can be written as the sum of two numbers to make this pretty
pattern:
10 = 1 + 9 = 2 + 8 = 3 + 7 = 4 + 6 =
5 + 5 = 6 + 4 = 7 + 3 = 8 + 2 = 9 + 1
It is also easy to write even large numbers, like 34470251, as a sum:
34470251 = 34470194 + 57. The inverse of addition, subtraction, is
pretty simple also.
Multiplication is much trickier, and its inverse, division, is really
quite hard; the simple pattern disappears, and writing 34470251 as a
product is, well, fiendishly difficult. Suddenly, simple arithmetic has
turned into difficult mathematics!
The difficulty is easy to understand but hard to resolve. The fact is
that some numbers, the composite numbers, can be written as a
product of two other numbers, as we learn from our multiplication
tables. These numbers start with: 2 × 2 is 4, 2 × 3 is 6, and 2 × 4 is 8,
followed later by 3 × 3 is 9 and 6 × 7 is 42, and so on.
Other numbers cannot be written as a product, except of them-
selves and 1. For example, 5 = 5 × 1 = 1 × 5, but that’s all. These are
the mysterious prime numbers, whose sequence starts,
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 
37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, . . .

Notice that 1 is an exception: it is not counted as a prime number,
nor is it composite. This is because many properties of prime num-
bers are easier to state and have fewer exceptions if 1 is not prime.
(Zero also is neither prime nor composite.)
The prime numbers seem so irregular as to be random, although they
are in fact determinate. This mixture of almost-randomness and pat-
tern has enticed mathematicians for centuries, professional and ama-
teur alike, to make calculations, spot patterns, make conjectures, and
then (attempt) to prove them.
Sometimes, their conjectures have been false. So many conjectures
about primes are as elegant as they are simple, and the temptation to
believe them, to believe that you have discovered a pattern in the
primes, can be overwhelming—until you discover the counterexample
that destroys your idea. As Henri Poincaré wrote, “When a sudden 
illumination invades the mathematicians’s mind, . . . it sometimes
happens . . . that it will not stand the test of verification . . . it is to be
observed almost always that this false idea, if it had been correct,
would have flattered our natural instincts for mathematical elegance.”
(Poincaré n.d.)
Sometimes a conjecture has only been proved many years later. The
most famous problem in mathematics today, by common consent, is
a conjecture, the Riemann hypothesis, which dates from a brilliant
paper published in 1859. Whoever finally proves it will become more
famous than Andrew Wiles, who was splashed across the front pages
when he finally proved Fermat’s Last Theorem in 1994.
This fertility of speculation has given a special role to the modern
electronic computer. In the good old bad old days, “computer” actu-
ally meant a person who computed, and a long and difficult task it
could be for the mathematician who was not a human calculator like
Euler or Gauss.
Today, computers can generate data faster than it can be read, and
can complete calculations in seconds or hours that would have taken
a human calculator years—and the computer makes no careless mis-
takes. (The programmer may err, of course!) Computers also put you
in touch with actual numbers, in a way that an abstract proof does
not. As John Milnor puts it:
If I can give an abstract proof of something, I’m reasonably happy. But if I
can get a concrete, computational proof and actually produce numbers I’m
much happier. I’m rather an addict at doing things on the computer. . . . I
2 • Introduction

have a visual way of thinking, and I’m happy if I can see a picture of what
I’m working with. (Bailey and Borwein 2000)
It has even been seriously argued that mathematics is becoming
more of an experimental science as a result of the computer, in
which the role of proof is devalued. That is nonsense: it is only by
penetrating below the surface glitter that mathematicians gain the
deepest understanding. Why did Gauss publish six proofs of the law
of quadratic reciprocity (and leave a seventh among his papers)?
Because each proof illuminated the phenomenon from a different
angle and deepened his understanding.
Computers have had two other effects. The personal computer has
encouraged thousands of amateurs to get stuck in and to explore the
prime numbers. The result is a mass of material varying from the
amusing but trivial to the novel, serious, and important.
The second effect is that very complex calculations needed to
prove that a large number is prime, or to find its factors, have sud-
denly become within reach. In 1876 Édouard Lucas proved that 
2127 −1 is prime. It remained the largest known prime of that form
until 1951. Today, a prime of this size can be proved prime in a few
seconds, though the problem of factorization remains intractable for
large numbers, so public key encryption and methods such as the
RSA algorithm have recently made prime numbers vitally important
to business (and the military).
Despite the thousands of mathematicians working on properties of the
prime numbers, numerous conjectures remain unresolved. Computers
are wonderful at creating data, and not bad at finding counterexam-
ples, but they prove nothing. Many problems and conjectures about
prime numbers will only be eventually solved through deeper and
deeper insight, and for the time being seem to be beyond our under-
standing. As Gauss put it, “It is characteristic of higher arithmetic that
many of its most beautiful theorems can be discovered by induction
with the greatest of ease but have proofs that lie anywhere but near at
hand and are often found only after many fruitless investigations with
the aid of deep analysis and lucky combinations.” See our entry on zeta
mysteries:the quantum connection! Gauss added, referring to his own
methods of working as well as those of Fermat and Euler and others:
[I]t often happens that many theorems, whose proof for years was sought
in vain, are later proved in many different ways. As soon as a new result is
Introduction • 3

discovered by induction, one must consider as the first requirement the
finding of a proof by any possible means [emphasis added]. But after such
good fortune, one must not in higher arithmetic consider the investigation
closed or view the search for other proofs as a superfluous luxury. For
sometimes one does not at first come upon the most beautiful and simplest
proof, and then it is just the insight into the wonderful concatenation of
truth in higher arithmetic that is the chief attraction for study and often
leads to the discovery of new truths. For these reasons the finding of new
proofs for known truths is often at least as important as the discovery itself.
(Gauss 1817)
The study of the primes brings in every style and every level of
mathematical thinking, from the simplest pattern spotting (often mis-
leading, as we have noted) to the use of statistics and advanced
counting techniques, to scientific investigation and experiment, all
the way to the most abstract concepts and most subtle proofs that
depend on the unparalleled insight and intuitive perceptions of the
greatest mathematicians. Prime numbers offer a wonderful field for
exploration by amateurs and professionals alike.
This is not a treatise or an historical account, though it contains
many facts, historical and otherwise. Rather, it is an introduction to
the fascination and beauty of the prime numbers. Here is an exam-
ple that I have occasionally used to, successfully, persuade nonbe-
lievers with no mathematical background that mathematics can
indeed be delightful. First write down the square numbers, 1  1 = 1,
2  2 = 4, 3  3 = 9, and so on. (Notice that to avoid using the × for
multiplication, because x is also used in algebra, we use a dot above
the text baseline.)
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
. . .
This sequence is especially simple and regular. Indeed, we don’t
even need to multiply any numbers to get it. We could just as well
have started with 1 and added the odd numbers. 1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 5 = 9;
9 + 7 = 16, and so on.
Now write down the prime numbers, the numbers with no factors
except themselves and 1:
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
23
29
. . .
No such simplicity here! The jumps from one number to the next
vary irregularly from 1 to 6 (and would eventually become much
larger). Yet there is a concealed pattern connecting these two
sequences. To see it, strike out 2, which is the only even prime, and
4 • Introduction

all the primes that are one less than a multiple of 4; so we delete 3,
7, 11, 19, and 23 . . . The sequence of remaining primes goes,
5
13
17
29
37
41
53
57
61
73
. . .
And the connection? Every one of these primes is the sum of two
squares, of two of the numbers in the first sequence, in a unique way:
5 = 1 + 4,
13 = 4 + 9,
17 = 1 + 16,
29 = 4 + 25,
37 = 1 + 36
and so on. This extraordinary fact is related to Pythagoras’s theorem
about the sides of a right-angled triangle, and was known to Dio-
phantus in the third century. It was explored further by Fermat, and
then by Euler and Gauss and a host of other great mathematicians.
We might justly say that it has been the mental springboard and the
mysterious origin of a large portion of the theory of numbers—and
yet the basic facts of the case can be explained to a school pupil.
There lies the fascination of the prime numbers. They combine the
maximum of simplicity with the maximum of depth and mystery. 
On a plaque attached to the NASA deep space probe we are de-
scribed in symbols for the benefit of any aliens who might meet the
spacecraft as “bilaterally symmetrical, sexually differentiated bipeds
located on one of the outer spirals of the Milky Way, capable of rec-
ognizing the prime numbers and moved by one extraordinary qual-
ity that lasts longer than all our other urges—curiosity.”
I hope that you will discover (or be reminded of ) some of the fasci-
nation of the primes in this book. If you are hooked, no doubt you
will want to look at other books—there is a selection of recom-
mended books marked in the bibliography with an asterisk—and
you will also find a vast amount of material on the Internet: some of
the best sites are listed at the “Some Prime Web Sites” section at the
end of the bibliography. To help you with your own research,
Appendix A is a list of the first 500 primes, and Appendix B lists the
first 80 values of the most common arithmetic functions.
Note: As this book went to press, the record for the largest known
prime number was broken by Dr. Martin Nowak, a German eye spe-
cialist who is a member of the worldwide GIMPS (Great Internet
Mersenne Prime Search) project, after fifty days of searching on his
2.4GHz Pentium 4 personal computer. His record prime is 225,964,951 −1
and has 7,816,230 digits.

abc conjecture
The abc conjecture was first proposed by Joseph Oesterlé and David
Masser in 1985. It concerns the product of all the distinct prime factors
of n, sometimes called the radical of n and written r(n). If n is square-
free (not divisible by any perfect square), then r(n) = n. On the other
hand, for a number such as 60 = 22  3  5, r(60) = 2  3  5 = 30.
r(n) is smallest when n is a power of a prime: then r( pq) = p. So
r(8) = r(32) = r(256) = 2, and r(6561) = r(38) = 3.
The more duplicated factors n has, the larger n will be compared to
r(n). For example, if n = 9972 = 22  32  277, then r(9972) = 1662,
and r(n) = 1⁄4n.
The abc conjecture says, roughly, that if a and b are two numbers
with no common factor, and sum c, then the number abc cannot be
very composite. More precisely, David Masser proved that the ratio
r(abc)/c can be as small as you like. Less than 1⁄100? Yes! Less than
0.00000001? Yes! And so on.
However—and this is Masser’s claim and the abc conjecture—this
is only just possible. If we calculate r(abc)n/c instead, where n is any
number greater than 1, then we can’t make r(abc)/c as small as we
like, and this is true even if n is only slightly greater than 1. So even
if n is as small as 1.00001, r(abc)n/c has a lower limit that isn’t zero.
Why is this conjecture about numbers that are not squarefree so
important? Because, incredibly, so many important theorems could
be proved quite easily, if it were true. Here are just five of the many
consequences of the abc conjecture being true:
• Fermat’s Last Theorem could be proved very easily. The proof
by Andrew Wiles is extremely long and complex.
• There are infinitely many Wieferich primes.
• There is only a finite number of sets of three consecutive pow-
erful numbers.
• There is only a finite number of solutions satisfying Brocard’s
equation, n! + 1 = m2.
• All the polynomials (xn −1)/(x −1) have an infinity of square-
free values. (Browkin 2000, 10)
6 • abc conjecture

abundant number
A number is abundant if the sum of its proper divisors (or aliquot
parts, meaning all its divisors except the number itself) is greater than
the number. Roughly speaking, numbers are abundant when they
have several different small prime factors. Thus 12 = 22  3 is abun-
dant, because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12.
Abundant numbers were presented by Nicomachus (c. AD 100) in
his Introduction to Arithmetic, which included definitions of prime
numbers (he did not consider 1, or unity, and 2 to be numbers) and
also deficient and perfect numbers, explaining that,
Among simple even numbers, some are superabundant, others are defi-
cient: these two classes are as two extremes opposed to one another; as for
those that occupy the middle position between the two, they are said to be
perfect. And those which are said to be opposite to each other, the super-
abundant and the deficient, are divided in their condition, which is inequal-
ity, into the too much and the too little.
In the case of the too much, is produced excess, superfluity, exaggera-
tions and abuse; in the case of too little, is produced wanting, defaults, pri-
vations and insufficiencies. And in the case of those that are found between
the too much and the too little, that is in equality, is produced virtue, just
measure, propriety, beauty and things of that sort—of which the most
exemplary form is that type of number which is called perfect. (O’Connor
and Robertson n.d.)
He also wrote, in the style of the period, that “even abundant num-
bers” are like an animal with “too many parts or limbs, with ten
tongues, as the poet says, and ten mouths, or with nine lips, or three
rows of teeth,” whereas perfect numbers are linked to “wealth, mod-
eration, propriety, beauty, and the like.” (Lauritzen, Versatile Num-
bers)
Nicomachus claimed that all odd numbers are deficient. Most
abundant numbers are indeed even. The smallest odd abundant is
945 = 33  5  7. There are only twenty-three odd abundant numbers
less than 10,000.
Every multiple of an abundant number is abundant. Therefore, there
is an infinite number of abundant numbers. The sequence starts:

abundant number • 7

The pair 54 and 56 is the first abundant numbers with the same sum
of proper divisors, 120. The next pairs are 60 and 78 (sum = 168) and
66 and 70 (sum = 144).
Roughly 24.8% of the positive integers are abundant.
The sum of all the divisors of n, including n itself, is called σ(n).
When n = 12, σ(n)/n = 28/12 = 7/3, which is a record for numbers
up to 12. Any number that sets a record for σ(n)/n is called super-
abundant. These are the first few record-breaking values of σ(n)/n:

If n is even and σ(n)/n > 9, then it has at least fifty-five distinct prime
factors.
Every number greater than 20161 is the sum of two abundant numbers.

AKS algorithm for primality testing
Our world resonates with patterns. The waxing and waning of
the moon. The changing of the seasons. The microscopic cell
structure of all living things have patterns. Perhaps that explains
our fascination with prime numbers which are uniquely without
pattern. Prime numbers are among the most mysterious phenom-
ena in mathematics.
—Manindra Agrawal (2003)
The ideal primality test is a definite yes-no test that also runs quickly
on modern computers. In August 2002, Manindra Agrawal of the
Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India, and his two brilliant
PhD students Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena, who were both in the
1997 Indian Mathematics Olympiad Squad, announced just such a
test, using his own novel version of Fermat’s Little Theorem, in a short
paper of only nine pages that was also extremely simple and elegant.
In a sign of the times, Agrawal sent an e-mail to a number of
prominent mathematicians with the subject header “PRIMES is in P,”
and also put it on his Web site. It was downloaded more than thirty
thousand times in the first twenty-four hours, and the site was visited
8 • AKS algorithm for primality testing

more than two million times in the first ten days. (Earlier, AKS had
reached a gap in their attempted proof, which they filled by search-
ing the Web and finding just the mathematical result they needed.)
“PRIMES is in P” means that a number can be tested to decide
whether or not it is prime in a time that is roughly proportional to its
number of digits. This means that it is fast for very large numbers but
not so fast for the kind of numbers that often have to be tested in prac-
tical applications. Fortunately, in another sign of the times, within
hours of its publication other mathematicians were finding variations
on the original AKS algorithm that made it much faster. Currently, the
most-improved versions will run about two million times faster. This
nearly makes it competitive with the most efficient current algorithm—
but Agrawal will never benefit financially, because he decided against
trying to patent the result.
The algorithm is so simple that it has prompted many mathematicians
to wonder what other problems might have unexpectedly simple solu-
tions: for example, the problem of factorizing large numbers. Agrawal’s
algorithm is no help here: the most it can do is show that a number is
composite, without saying anything about its factors, so it will have no
effect on encryption using prime numbers. (Agrawal 2002)
See primality testing
aliquot sequences (sociable chains)
The aliquot parts (the expression is old-fashioned) of a number are
its proper divisors, meaning its divisors apart from the number itself.
Any integer is the start of an aliquot sequence. Simply calculate the
sum of its proper divisors and then repeat. Starting with 10 we soon
reach 1: the proper divisors of 10 are 1, 2, and 5, summing to 8; of 8
they are 1, 2, and 4, summing to 7, which is prime, so its only proper
divisor is 1.
For 24 we get this sequence:
24
36
55
17
1
However, 28 immediately repeats, because 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28,
and so 28 is a perfect number, while 220 and 284 each lead at once
to the other, so they form an amicable pair.
For reasons that are not understood, many aliquot sequences end
in Paganini’s amicable pair, 1184 and 1210.
aliquot sequences (sociable chains) • 9

The third possibility is that the sequence repeats through a cycle; the
first two examples of such sociable chains or aliquot cycles were
found by Poulet in 1918. The smaller is:
12496
14288
15472
14536
14264
The second chain is of twenty-eight numbers: 14316, 19116, 31704,
47616, 83328, 177792, 295488, 629072, 589786, 294896, 358336,
418904, 366556, 274924, 275444, 243760, 376736, 381028, 285778,
152990, 122410, 97946, 48976, 45946, 22976, 22744, 19916, 17716,
(14316). It is remarkable how little oscillation there is in this
sequence. Drawn as a graph there would be just four peaks, at
629072, 418904, 275444, and 381028. (Beiler 1966, 29)
No more chains were discovered until 1969 when Henri Cohen
checked all aliquot sequences starting under 60,000,000 and found
seven chains of four links each. No chain of three links—nicknamed
a “crowd”!—has ever been found, though no one has a reason why
they should not exist.
Catalan in 1888 and then Dickson conjectured that no aliquot
sequence goes off to infinity—they all end in a cycle or in 1. A
sequence starting with an abundant number will initially increase;
however, there are far more deficient than abundant numbers, which
suggests that most sequences will indeed decrease more than
increase.
There are just seventeen numbers less than 2000 for which the
problem is unsolved: 276, 552, 564, 660, 966, 1074, 1134, 1464, 1476,
1488, 1512, 1560, 1578, 1632, 1734, 1920, and 1992. Notice that they
are all even. It has been conjectured that the aliquot sequences for
most even numbers do not end in 1 or a cycle.
The first five of these numbers are the so-called Lehmer five. Orig-
inally the list was the Lehmer six, but then the fate of 840 was set-
tled. It eventually reaches 1, after peaking at:
3 463982 260143 725017 429794 136098 072146 586526 240388
D.N.Lehmer showed that 138 rises after 117 steps to 179,931,895,322
and then ends in 1 after 177 steps. (Guy 1981, B6)
Wolfgang Creyaufmueller found the longest known terminating
sequence in 2002. It starts at 446580 and ends 4,736 steps later with
the prime 601, followed by 1. (Creyaufmueller 2002)
10 • aliquot sequences (sociable chains)

Manuel Benito and Juan Varona found the sequence with the highest
known peak: it starts with 3630 and has a maximum length of 100
digits, ending after 2,624 steps with the prime 59, and then 1. (Ben-
ito and Varona 2001)
almost-primes
The almost-prime numbers have a limited number of prime factors.
The 2-almost-primes have two prime factors (including duplicated
factors) and are also called semiprimes: the 3-almost-primes have
three, and so on.
The sequence of 3-almost-primes starts 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, 42,
44, 45, 50, . . .
The sequence of n-almost-primes starts with 2n, 3  2n −1, . . .
amicable numbers
A pair of numbers is amicable (or semiperfect) if each is the sum of
the proper divisors of the other. The smallest pair is 220 and 284. The
proper divisors of 220 = 22  5  11 sum to,
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284
and similarly: 284 = 22  71 and 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.
According to the philosopher Iamblichus (c. AD 250–330), the fol-
lowers of Pythagoras “call certain numbers amicable numbers, adopt-
ing virtues and social qualities to numbers, such as 284 and 220; 
for the parts of each have the power to generate the other,” and
Pythagoras described a friend as “one who is the other I, such as are
220 and 284.”
In the Bible (Genesis 32:14), Jacob gives 220 goats (200 female and
20 male) to Esau on their reunion. There are other biblical references
at Ezra 8:20 and 1 Chronicles 15:6, while 284 occurs in Nehemiah
11:18. These references are all to the tribe of Levi, whose name
derives from the wish of Levi’s mother to be amicably related to his
father. (Aviezri and Fraenkel: Guy 1994)
They were also used in magic and astrology. Ibn Khaldun (1332–
1406) wrote that “the art of talismans has also made us recognize the
marvelous virtues of amicable (or sympathetic) numbers. These 
numbers are 220 and 284. . . . Persons who occupy themselves with 
amicable numbers • 11

talismans assure that these numbers have a particular influence in
establishing union and friendship between individuals.” (Ore 1948, 97)
Thabit ibn Qurra (c. AD 850) in his Book on the Determination of
Amicable Numbers noted that if you choose n so that each of the
expressions a = 3  2n −1, b = 3  2n −1 −1, and c = 9  22n −1 −1 is
prime, then 2nab and 2nc are amicable numbers. Unfortunately, it
isn’t easy to make them all prime at once, and in fact it only works
for n = 2, 4, and 7 and no other n less than 20,000.
A second pair, 17,296 and 18,416, was discovered by Ibn al-Banna
(1256–1321) and rediscovered by Fermat in 1636. Descartes found
the third pair, 9,363,584 and 9,437,056, which is the case n = 7 in
Thabit’s formulae. Euler then discovered no less than sixty-two more
examples, without following Thabit’s rule.
Paganini’s amicable pair, 1184 and 1210, is named after Nicolo
Paganini, who discovered them in 1866 when he was a sixteen-year-
old schoolboy. They had previously been missed by Fermat, Des-
cartes, Euler, and others.
More than 7,500 amicable pairs have been found, using computers,
including all pairs up to 1014. Is there an infinite number of amicable
pairs? It is generally believed so, partly because Herman te Riele has a
method of constructing “daughter” pairs from some “mother” pairs. Te
Riele has also published all of the 1,427 amicable pairs less than 1010.

amicable curiosities
• There is no known amicable pair in which one number is a
square.
• The numbers in amicable pairs end in 0 or 5 surprisingly often,
for no known reason.
12 • amicable curiosities

• Most amicable numbers have many different factors. Can a
power of a prime, pn, be one of an amicable pair? If so, then
pn > 101500 and n > 1400.
• It is not known whether there is a pair of coprime amicable
numbers. If there is, the numbers must exceed 1025 and their
product must have at least twenty-two distinct prime factors.
Andrica’s conjecture
Dorin Andrica conjectured that pn + 1
 −pn
 < 1 for all n. This is
really a conjecture about the gaps between prime numbers and is not
even a very strong conjecture, yet it has never been proved. The
largest value of the difference for n less than 1000 is 11
 −7 =
0.670873 . . . which is well below 1.
Imran Ghory has used data on largest prime gaps to confirm the
conjecture up to 1.3002  1016.
arithmetic progressions, of primes
In an arithmetic progression (or sequence) the differences between
successive terms are constant, for example:
3
7
11

31

. . .
with constant difference 4. This happens to already contain seven
primes, with one sequence of three consecutive primes.
The current record for the largest number of consecutive primes in
arithmetic progression has ten primes. It was set 11:56 a.m. on March
2, 1998, by Manfred Toplic of Klagenfurt, Austria, in a typical example
of distributed computing. The first term is the prime 100 99697 24697
14247 63778 66555 87969 84032 95093 24689 19004 18036 03417 75890
43417 03348 88215 90672 29719, and the common difference is 210.
The same team also set the previous record of nine consecutive
primes, on January 15, 1998. The team was led by Harvey Dubner and
Tony Forbes. More than seventy people, using about two hundred
machines, searched nearly fifty ranges of a trillion numbers each.
The longest known arithmetic progression of nonconsecutive
primes was discovered by Pritchard, Moran, and Thyssen in 1993. It
is twenty-two terms long, starting with the prime 11410337850553

and with common difference 4609098694200. On April 22, 2003,

in arithmetic progression exists. Ben Green of the University of
British Columbia and Terence Tao of the University of California at
Los Angeles proved in 2004 that prime arithmetic progressions of any
length do exist, though their proof, like so many proofs, is noncon-
structive, so they cannot actually generate any examples.

Aurifeuillian factorization
Since a2 + b2 cannot be factorized into two algebraic factors, unlike
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b), we might assume that n4 + 1, which is also
the sum of two squares, cannot be factorized. Not so!
n4 + 1 = (n2 −n + 1)(n2 + n + 1)
14 • Aurifeuillian factorization

Now we can see a connection: a2 + b2 = (a + b)2 −4ab = (a −ab
 +
b)(a + ab
 + b), which normally “doesn’t count” because of the
square roots. It follows that n4 + 1 is always composite, except when
n2 −n + 1 = 1 and n = 0 or 1.
This is an example of an Aurifeuillian factorization, named after Léon
François Antoine Aurifeuille, who discovered a special case in 1873:
24m −2 + 1 = (22m −1 + 2m + 1)(22m −1 −2m + 1)
Knowledge of this factorization would have saved the many years of
his life that Fortuné Landry spent factoring 258 + 1, finally finishing in
1869. Landry’s gargantuan factorization is just a trivial special case!
258 + 1 = (229 + 215 + 1)(229 −215 + 1)
Édouard Lucas later found more Aurifeuillian factorizations, which are
related to the complex roots of unity. Here are two more examples:
36k −3 + 1 = (32k −1 + 1)(32k −1 −3k + 1)(32k −1 + 3k + 1)
55h −1 = (5h −1)LM, where L = T 2 −T5k + 5h and 
M = T 2 + T5k + 5h and T = 5h + 1, h = 2k −1.
Aurifeuillian factors have other uses. For example, if Ln is the nth

Bang’s theorem
Does every term in a sequence contain at least one prime factor that
has not appeared before in the sequence? Such a prime factor is
called primitive.
If a > 1 is fixed, then every number an −1 has a primitive prime
factor, with the sole exception of 26 −1 = 63. Similarly, if a > 1, then
every number an + 1 has a primitive prime factor, with the sole
exception of 23 + 1 = 9. This was proved by Bang in 1886, and inci-
dentally offers another way to prove that there is an infinity of prime
numbers.
Zsigmondy proved the same theorem for the more general functions
an −bn and an + bn, with the same condition and the same excep-
tions. The sequence for T = 2n + 3n starts:

Bateman’s conjecture

Is this the only sum of this kind, using prime numbers? No one
knows. If composite numbers are allowed, there is at least one other
solution:
1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + . . . + 212 = 1 + 90 + 902 = 8191
Beal’s conjecture, and prize
The Texas millionaire Andrew Beal, the fifty-one-year-old founder of
the Beal Bank and Beal Aerospace Technologies that builds rockets
for satellite launches, and a number enthusiast, is offering a reward
to the first person to prove (or disprove) this conjecture, which is a
generalization of Fermat’s Last Theorem:
16 • Bang’s theorem

If xm + yn = zr where x, y, z, m, n, and r are all positive integers, and
m, n, and r are greater than 2, then x, y, and z have a common factor.
Without the condition that m, n, and r must be greater than 2, there
are many solutions, including all Pythagorean triples starting with 
32 + 42 = 52 and 52 + 122 = 132, and the solutions to the Fermat-Catalan
conjecture. It follows, from a theorem of Falting, that for any partic-
ular choice of m, n, and r, there can only be a finite number of solu-
tions, but are there any at all?
The conjecture and prize were originally announced in 1997 in the
prestigious Notices of the American Mathematical Society, originally
with a prize of $5,000 rising by $5,000 a year to a maximum of
$50,000. Since then the prize has been increased to $100,000 for
either a proof or a counterexample. The prize money has been
handed to the American Mathematical Society for safekeeping and
the interest is being used to fund the annual Erdös Memorial Lecture.
Just in case anyone thinks that they can work out the answer on a
scruffy piece of paper, the award will be given only when “the solu-
tion has been recognized by the mathematics community. This
includes that either a proof has been given and the result has
appeared in a reputable referred journal or a counterexample has
been given and verified.” (www.bealconjecture.com)
The solution is sure to be difficult because the conjecture is based
on extensive numerical tests. Beal and a colleague spent thousands
of hours searching for solutions for various values of the exponents,
only to find that when solutions appeared, a pair out of x, y, and z
always had a common factor. Hence the conjecture, which is sur-
prisingly novel. (A similar but not identical idea was conjectured by
Viggo Brun in 1914.)
If the abc conjecture is true, then there are no solutions to Beal’s
equation when the exponents are large enough, and Darmon and
Granville showed in 1995 that in effect there are at most a finite num-
ber of solutions. But are there any?
See Fermet-Catalan equation and conjecture.
Benford’s law
If numbers in general were equally likely to start with any of the dig-
its 1 to 9, then out of the 78,498 prime numbers less than 1,000,000
Benford’s law • 17

we would expect about one-ninth of them to begin with the digit 1,
or about 8,700, but no, there are 9,585 such primes starting with the
digit 1. In fact, from first digit 1 to first digit 9, the number of primes
in each category decreases.
Why this difference? Because in very many circumstances (not all)
numbers begin with the digit 1 more often than with other digits.
This was first noticed by the nineteenth-century astronomer Simon
Newcomb, who claimed, “That the ten digits do not occur with equal
frequency must be evident to anyone making use of logarithm tables,
and noticing how much faster the first pages wear out than the last
ones. The first significant figure is oftener 1 than any other digit and
the frequency diminishes up to 9.”
His conclusion was taken up again by Benford, a physicist work-
ing for the General Electric Company in 1938. He concluded that the
first digit is d with probability log10(1 + 1/d), which for d = 1 is ap-
proximately 0.30103.

It is sometimes assumed, without any sound reason, that Ben-
ford’s law is universal, that it applies to every set of numbers, any-
where, as if it were “a built-in characteristic of our number system.”
This isn’t so. A counterexample is the powers of 2, at least for low
powers. Here are the frequencies of the first digits of 2n from n = 0

Ada Lovelace and the First Computer Algorithm
In 1840 Charles Babbage asked his collaborator Ada Lovelace,
daughter of Lord Byron, to add her own notes to a manuscript on his
Analytical Engine. The machine used cards based on those used to
control the Jacquard loom (and which were forerunners of the
Holerith cards used in early modern computers).
In her notes Lovelace emphasized (as we would put it today) the
interplay between programming and machinery, software and hard-
ware:
In enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols in succes-
sions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between
the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most
abstract branch of mathematical science. A new, a vast, and a powerful lan-
guage is developed for the future use of analysis.
She concluded by explaining how the engine could compute the
Bernoulli numbers, and made another comment that today’s com-
puter programmer will recognize at once:
We may here remark, that the average estimate of three Variable-cards com-
ing into use to each operation, is not to be taken as an absolutely and
literally correct amount for all cases and circumstances. Many special cir-
cumstances, either in the nature of a problem, or in the arrangements of the
engine under certain contingencies, influence and modify this average to a
greater or less extent.
This is generally considered to be the first account of a computer
algorithm. (Menabrea 1842)

Bernoulli numbers can also be calculated using the binomial coeffi-
cients from Pascal’s triangle:
B0 = 1
2B1 + 1B0 = 0
so B1 = −1⁄2
3B2 + 3B1 + B0 = 0
so B2 = 1⁄6
4B3 + 6B2 + 4B1 + B0 = 0
so B3 = 0
5B4 + 10B3 + 10B2 + 5B1 + B0 = 0
so B4 = −1⁄30
and so on.
There is also a connection between the Bernoulli numbers and the
Riemann zeta function:
Bn = (−1)n + 1nζ(1 −n)
Bernoulli number curiosities
• The denominator of Bn is always squarefree.
• The denominator of B2n equals the product of all the primes p
such that p −1 | 2n.
• The fractional part of Bn in the decimal system has a decimal
period that divides n, and there is a single digit before that
period. (Conway and Guy 1996, 107–10)
• G. J. Fee and S. Plouffe have computed B200,000, which has
about 800,000 digits.
Bertrand’s postulate
Joseph Bertrand (1822–1900) was a precocious student who pub-
lished his first paper, on electricity, at the age of seventeen, but
then became more notable as a teacher than as an original mathe-
matician.
Bertrand’s postulate states that if n is an integer greater than 3, then
there is at least one prime between n and 2n −2. (This is the precise
theorem. It is often claimed that there is a prime between n and 2n,
which is a weaker claim.)
Strangely, although it continues to be called a postulate, it is actu-
ally a theorem: it was proved by Tchebycheff in 1850 after Bertrand
in 1845 had verified it for n less than 3,000,000. It is also a rather
weak theorem that can be strengthened in several ways:
20 • Bertrand’s postulate

• Provided n is large enough, there are at least k primes
between n and 2n, however large the value of k.
• If n is at least 48, then there is at least one prime between n
and 9n/8.
• If n is greater than 6, then there is at least one prime of the
form 4k + 1 and at least one of the form 4k + 3 between n and
2n.
• If n is greater than or equal to 118, then the interval n to 4n/3
inclusive contains a prime of each of the forms 4n + 1, 4n −1,
6n + 1, and 6n −1.
• If n is greater than 15, then there is at least one number
between n and 2n that is the product of three different primes.
It also follows from Bertrand’s postulate that:
• There is at least one prime of any given digit length beginning
with the digit 1, in any base, not just base 10.
• The first 2k integers can always be arranged in k pairs so that
the sum of the entries in each pair is a prime.
• There is a number c such that the integral parts of 2c, 22c,
222c, . . . are primes. The constant c
is approximately
1.25164759777905. The first four primes are 2, 5, 37,
137438953481. The number c is not sufficiently accurately
known to calculate the next prime in the sequence. (R. L. Gra-
ham, D. E. Knuth, & O. Patashnik)
Bonse’s inequality
This states that if pn is the nth prime, then
pn + 1
2 < p1p2 p3 . . . pn
provided n > 3.
Brier numbers
A Riesel number is an integer k such that k  2n −1 is composite for
any integer value of n, and a Sierpinski number is an integer k such
that k  2n + 1 is composite for any integer value of n.
Brier numbers • 21

What about the Brier numbers, which are simultaneously Riesel
and Sierpinski? Eric Brier was the first to find one:
29364695660123543278115025405114452910889
Yves Gallot found three smaller Brier numbers in January 2000.
The smallest is twenty-seven-digits: 878503122374924101526292

Brocard’s conjecture
Brocard conjectured in 1904 that the only solutions of
n! + 1 = m2
are n = 4, 5, and 7. There are no other solutions with n < 109. (Berndt
and Galway n.d.)
Another of Brocard’s conjectures is that there are at least four
primes between the squares of any two consecutive primes, with the
exception of 2 and 3. This is related to Schinzel’s conjecture that, pro-
vided x is greater than 8, there is a prime between x and x + (log x)2.
See Opperman’s conjecture
Brun’s constant
In 1919 Viggo Brun (1885–1978) proved that the sum of the recipro-
cals of the twin primes converges to Brun’s constant:
1⁄3 + 1⁄5 + 1⁄5 + 1⁄7 + 1⁄11 + 1⁄13 + 1⁄17 + 1⁄19 + . . . = 1.9021605 . . .
It was in 1994, while he was trying to calculate Brun’s constant,
that Thomas R. Nicely discovered a famous flaw in the Intel Pentium
microprocessor. The Pentium chip occasionally gave wrong answers
to a floating-point (decimal) division calculations due to errors in five
entries in a lookup table on the chip. Intel spent millions of dollars
replacing the faulty chips.
More recently, Nicely has calculated that the value of Brun’s con-
stant based on all the pairs of twin primes less than 5  1015 is
1.902160582582  0.000000001620. (Nicely 2004a) These are the first
few approximate sums:

Viggo Brun’s methods have been used to study Goldbach’s conjec-
ture and the twin primes conjecture and to prove that there exist infi-
nitely many integers n such that n and n + 2 have at most nine prime
factors, and that all large even integers are the sum of two integers
each having at most nine prime factors.
See Mertens constant
Buss’s function
Frank Buss has defined a function, B(n), that seems to generate only
primes. It is calculated like this:
f (1) = 1
B(n) = [next prime to ( f (n) + 1)] −f(n)
f(n) = f(n −1)  B(n −1)

The conjecture has been tested successfully up to n = 603. However,
like so many such conjectures, it seems likely that this is a case of the
the strong law of small numbers. (Rivera, Conjecture 29)
Carmichael numbers
According to Fermat’s Little Theorem, if p is prime and n and p are
coprime (they have no common factor), then np −1  1 (mod p).
However, some composite numbers satisfy this equation also, and
do so for every value of n. These are the Carmichael numbers,
Carmichael numbers • 23

named after Robert Daniel Carmichael (1879–1967). They are some-
times called absolute pseudoprimes because they are pseudoprimes
to every base.
They are an annoyance if you are using Fermat’s Little Theorem to
test for primality, because if your number just happens to be a
Carmichael number, it will pass the test for any base—and still be
composite.
Fortunately, the Carmichael number is quite rare. Those less than
100,000 are: 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, 6601, 8911, 10585, 15841,
29341, 41041, 46657, 52633, 62745, 63973, and 75361.
There are only 2,163 less than 25,000,000,000, and 105,212 less
than 1015, each with at most nine prime factors.
If n is a Carmichael number, then it is squarefree, the product of at
least three distinct primes, and for every prime p divisor of n, 
p −1 divides n −1, and conversely. For example, 561 is the smallest
Carmichael number and 561 = 3  11  17, and 2, 10, and 16 all divide
560. The largest known Carmichael number with three prime factors
was found by Harvey Dubner. It has 10,200 digits.
The smallest with four distinct factors is 41041 = 7  11  13  41,
and 41040 is divisible by 6, 10, 12, and 40. The smallest with five dis-
tinct prime factors is 825265 and the smallest with six distinct prime
factors is 321197185.
Carmichael conjectured in 1910 that there is an infinite number of
Carmichael numbers. Alford, Granville, and Pomerance proved this
in 1994 by showing how suitable smooth numbers could be multi-
plied together to fit the Carmichael definition.
Whether there is an infinity of Carmichael numbers with a given
number of factors (at least three) is not known, however, nor
whether Carmichael numbers can be found with an arbitrarily large
number of factors.
Catalan’s conjecture
Anyone might notice as a curiosity that 8 and 9 are 23 and 32, respec-
tively, and that other small powers, such as 25 and 27, are not con-
secutive. Eugène Charles Catalan (1814–1894) conjectured in 1844
that 8 and 9 are indeed the only consecutive powers.
24 • Catalan’s conjecture

Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) had shown that these are the only
powers of 2 and 3 differing by 1, and Euler proved that 9 and 8 are
the only square and cube differing by 1.
Robert Tijdeman proved in 1976 that the equation x p −y q = 1 has
at most a finite number of solutions: if there is a solution, then p and
q are less than a certain (unknown!) constant, C.
Computer checks show that if x p −y q = 1, then p and q must
exceed 107. It is also known that if x p −y q = 1, and if p and q are
prime, then p|y and q|x.
In 2000, Preda Mihailescu proved that if any solutions apart from 8
and 9 exist, then p and q must both be double Wieferich primes: 
p(q −1) must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by q 2, and q (p −1)
must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by p2. The only known
examples are: 2 and 1093; 3 and 1006003; 5 and 1645333507; 83 and
4871; 911 and 318917; and 2903 and 18787.
It has also been proved by Hyyrö and Makowski that it is impossi-
ble to have three consecutive powers.
Catalan’s Mersenne conjecture
When Lucas proved in 1876 that 2127 −1 is prime, Catalan noticed
that 127 = 27 −1 and conjectured that this sequence, where Mp is the
pth Mersenne number, contains only primes:
C1 = 22 −1 = 3
= M2
C2 = 2C1 −1 = 23 −1
= M3
= 7
C3 = 2C2 −1 = 27 −1
= M7
= 127
C4 = 2C3 −1 = 2127 −1 = M127 =
170141183460469231731687303715884105727
and so on . . .
Unfortunately, C5 has more than 1038 digits and so cannot be tested
directly, though Curt Noll has verified that C5 has no prime divisor
less than 5  1050. Like so many conjectures of this kind, it is likely
that a composite term appears quite soon.

Champernowne’s constant
David Champernowne (1912–2000) discussed Champernowne’s con-
stant in 1933: 0.12345678910111213 . . . It is transcendental (Mahler
1961: MathWorld) and normal in base 10, meaning that each digit 0
to 9 occurs one-tenth of the time, each pair of digits from 00 to 99
occurs one-hundredth of the time, and so on.
champion numbers
Conway and Odlyzko call the difference pn −1 −pn a “champion for
x,” denoted by C(x), if it happens that it occurs most frequently for
all the consecutive primes less than x.
C(x) seems to take only the value 4, plus the values 2, 6, 30, 210,
2310, . . . which are the primorials, the result of multiplying the con-
secutive primes together. Is this true? Marek Wolf, Odlyzko, and
Rubinstein say yes. (Rivera, Conjecture 10)
Chinese remainder theorem
Sun Tsu Suan-ching (fourth century AD) posed this problem: “There
are certain things whose number is unknown. Divided by 3, the
remainder is 2; by 5 the remainder is 3; and by 7 the remainder is 2.
What will be the number?” The solution is 23. (Wells 1992, 23)
This is an example of the Chinese remainder theorem, which says
that if you know the remainders when N is divided by n numbers,
which are coprime in pairs, then you can find a unique smallest
value of N, and an infinity of other solutions, by adding any integral
multiple of the product of the n numbers (or subtracting if you are
satisfied with negative solutions).
In Sun Tsu Suan-ching’s puzzle, 3  5  7 = 105, so the solutions are
23, 23 + 105, 23 + 210, 23 + 315, and so on, and 23 −105 = −82 is the
smallest negative solution.
The Chinese remainder theorem can also be expressed in terms of
congruences: if
26 • Champernowne’s constant

x  r1 (mod m1)
x  r2 (mod m2)
x  r3 (mod m3)
. . .
x  rn (mod mn)
then there is a unique solution, X, for x lying between 0 and
m1m2 . . . mn, and the general solution is congruent to X (mod
m1m2 . . . mn).
One use of the Chinese remainder theorem is to do arithmetic on
large numbers by choosing a set of moduli m1, m2, . . . mn and then
treating each number as a set of remainders, r1, r2, r3, . . . rn, rather
than as a sequence of decimal or binary digits. Then you do the
arithmetic on the remainders and recover the solution by using the
Chinese remainder theorem.
cicadas and prime periods
Cicadas of the genus Magicicada appear once every 7, 13, or 17
years. Is it just a coincidence that these are prime numbers? Eric
Goles, Oliver Schulz, and Mario Markus have found evolutionary
predator-prey models that have prime periods—which they then
used to generate large prime numbers. (Sugden 2001, 177)
circle, prime
Is it always possible to arrange the numbers from 1 to 2n in a circle
so that each adjacent pair sums to a prime?
Antonio Filz calls such an arrangement a prime circle. For example,
these are the essentially unique prime circles for n = 1, 2, and 3:
1  4
1  6
1  2
4
5
2  3
3  2
There are two prime circles for n = 4 and forty-eight for n = 5. It is
not known if there are prime circles for all values of n.

A prime is circular if all the cyclic permutations of its digits are prime.
These primes and their cyclic permutations are circular, in base 10:

In Paris at the Collège de France on May 24, 2000, almost exactly one
hundred years since David Hilbert’s 23 problems were presented to
the world, seven new “Millennium Prize Problems” were announced,
for which the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
is offering prizes of $1 million to the first solver of each problem.
All the Clay problems are, of course, extremely difficult, and have
resisted the attempts of mathematicians for many years, but one
problem is outstanding: the only one from Hilbert’s original 23 that
appears in the Clay list is the Riemann hypothesis.
As a protection against the naive or frivolous claims that such a
large prize is sure to provoke, solvers must not send their claims
directly to the Clay Institute but must get them published in a math-
ematics journal of worldwide repute and the claimed solution must
then be accepted by the mathematics community. Two years is
allowed for this process. If the solution survives scrutiny, only then
will it be considered by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Clay
Mathematics Institute.
The procedure is slightly different if the claim is for a counterexam-
ple, so if you think you have found a zero of the Riemann zeta func-
tion that does not have real part 1⁄2, see the Clay Institute Web site for
what to do. However, since Andrew Odlyzko has calculated a million
zeros near zero number 1020 and ten billion zeros near zero number
1022, and the ZetaGrid distributed computing network is calculating
more than a billion zeros a day, you’d better get your skates on!
28 • circular prime

There is a second Clay prize challenge that is relevant to the
primes: the P versus NP problem. It is currently very hard to factor-
ize large numbers but quick and easy to check the factorization once
it is found. Is there really no way to factorize large numbers quickly?
If you do discover a method, you might plausibly earn far more
than the Clay Institute’s $1 million by selling your discovery to com-
mercial organizations—or governments—who use numbers that are
the product of two large primes for public key encryption and would
be very interested to hear that their secure communications can be
broken using your method!

encryption; Riemann hypothesis
compositorial
The product of all the composite numbers less than or equal to n is
n! (n-factorial) divided by the product of the primes less than or
equal to n, or n-primorial, denoted by n#. Iago Camboa has sug-
gested calling this n-compositorial. (Caldwell, Prime Pages) Just as n!
and n# have many factors, so does n!/n#, so n!/n#  1 is relatively
likely to be prime.
n!/n# + 1 is prime for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 14, 20, 26, 34, 56, . . .
n!/n# −1 is prime for n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 21, 34, 39, . . .

concatenation of primes
The concatenation of the primes gives the sequence:
2, 23, 235, 2357, 235711, . . .
The nth term is prime for n = 1, 2, 4, 128, 174, 342, 435,
1429, . . . with no others less than 7837. (Weisstein, 2001)
The Copeland-Erdös constant is the decimal 0.23571113171923 . . .
Copeland and Erdös (1946) showed that it is normal in base 10. It is
also irrational, as is the decimal number .0110101000101000101 . . .
in which the nth digit is 1 if n is prime and 0 otherwise.

conjectures
The theory of numbers, more than any other branch of pure
mathematics, has begun by being an empirical science. Its most
famous theorems have all been conjectured, sometimes a hun-
dred years or more before they have been proved; and they have
been suggested by the evidence of a mass of computation.
—G. H. Hardy (1920, 651)
One of the delights of prime numbers is that their combination of
strict definition with apparent irregularity amounting almost to ran-
domness invites mathematicians both professional and amateur to
propose more and more problems and conjectures, the best-known
named after their proposers.
Many of these conjectures are extremely difficult to settle. The
prime numbers are just too mysterious and difficult!
When a sudden illumination invades the mathematician’s mind . . . it some-
times happens . . . that it will not stand the test of verification . . . it is to be
observed that almost always this false idea, if it had been correct, would
have flattered our natural instincts for mathematical elegance. (Henri Poin-
caré n.d.)
They are also too tempting. As Poincaré’s comment suggests, it is
oh so easy to spot an elegant pattern and assume that it goes on for-
ever. How often it doesn’t! How often we are disappointed!
As G. H. Hardy also noted, “Some branches of mathematics have
the pleasant characteristic that what seems plausible at first sight is
generally true. In [analytic prime number] theory anyone can make
plausible conjectures, and they are almost always false.” (Hardy
1915, 18)
The simplest conjectures are easy to make and may be easy to prove,
though not as easily as in the joke about a physicist who notices that
3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is not—but that’s an experimen-
tal error!—11 is prime, 13 is prime . . . and so concludes that all odd
number are prime!
The most important conjectures tend to be made by the most
brilliant mathematicians who have looked extraordinarily deeply
into the subject and whose intuition tells them that a certain “fact”
30 • conjectures

is likely to be true, although they cannot prove it. Such deep con-
jectures have contributed enormously to the progress of mathe-
matics.
Fermat’s Last Theorem, labeled a “theorem” only because Fermat
claimed to have proved it, was for centuries a plausible conjecture
until it was finally proved by Andrew Wiles.
Today’s most famous and hardest mathematical problem is by
common consent the Riemann hypothesis, a conjecture about the
distribution of the prime numbers.
Conjectures about prime numbers have another feature that can be
both intriguing and infuriating. Because the primes are quite fre-
quent among the “small” integers, there are many tempting conjec-
tures that fail as soon as we get out a modern electronic calculator or
a powerful computer.
Fermat’s conjecture that 22n + 1 is always prime must have seemed
very tempting to Fermat, but the very first value that he did not cal-
culate, because it was so large, turned out to be composite! It is
indeed easy to find functions that seem to produce many primes for
small values of n, but which start to produce composites as n
increases. How tempting to conjecture that we have discovered a for-
mula for primes and how disappointing when the formula fails!
Richard Guy has referred to this phenomenon as the strong law of
small numbers.
On the other hand, some conjecture may seem very well founded
indeed, because the first counterexample is so very large. In 1919,
George Pólya, author of Mathematical Discovery and Mathematics
and Plausible Reasoning, conjectured that the number of integers 
≤N with an odd number of prime factors is never less than the num-
ber of integers ≤N with an even number of prime factors. (For the
purposes of this conjecture, repeated factors are counted, N = 1 is
counted as having no prime factor, and a prime is counted as having
one prime factor.)
For nearly forty years this was believed to be true, though no one
could prove it. Then in 1958 it was proved that it is false for infinitely
many N, and in 1980 M. Tanaka showed that the smallest counterex-
ample is when N = 906,150,257. (Haimo 1995)
You may well find yourself making a conjecture or two as you read
this book: meanwhile, many well-known conjectures have their own
entries or are listed in the index.

consecutive integer sequence
The consecutive integer sequence goes: 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, . . .
There are no primes among the first 13,500 terms. (Weisstein, Math-
World)
consecutive numbers
Sylvester proved in 1892 that every product of n consecutive integers
greater than n is divisible by a prime greater than n.
In fact, although the product of five consecutive integers 6  7  8 
9  10 is divisible by just one prime, 7, greater than 5, the product 
200  201  202  203  204 is divisible by five primes, 67, 101, 7, 29,
and 17. This suggests that Sylvester’s result is rather generous:
indeed, the product of just two consecutive numbers is always divis-
ible by a prime greater than N, if the product is large enough.
Since the triangular numbers have the formula 1⁄2n(n + 1), we could
rephrase this to say that for any number N, all the triangular numbers
from a certain point onward are divisible by a prime greater than N.
Below each of these nine composite numbers is one of its prime
factors, and all these factors are different:

In general, given n consecutive integers greater than nn −1 + 1, then
each of them has a prime factor that divides none of the others.
(Grimm 1969)
consecutive primes, sums of
In how many ways can a number, n, be written as the sum of one or
more consecutive primes? If we call it f(n), then f(5) = 2, because 
5 = 5 and 2 + 3, and f(41) = 3, because 41 = 11 + 13 + 17 = 2 + 3 +
5 + 7 + 11 + 13.
Leo Moser has proved that the average value of f(n) from n = 1 to
N is log 2 as N tends to infinity. (Guy 1981, C2)

It takes 19 steps for the number 4 = 22 to appear, and 2 is the first

second prime. After another 211 steps, the next power of 2 is 32 = 25,
and 5 is the third prime. And so on. (Conway and Guy 1996, 130,
147) (Guy 1983)
cousin primes
Cousin primes are pairs differing by 4, so they are rather more dis-
tant than twin primes but less distant than sexy primes. There are
fourteen pairs of twin primes less than 200, and also fourteen pairs
of cousin primes: 3-7, 7-11, 13-17, 19-23, 37-41, 43-47, 67-71, 79-83,
97-101, 103-107, 109-113, 127-131, 163-167, and 193-197. There are
twenty-six more pairs below 1000.
If the first of the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures is true, then the twin
and cousin primes have the same density, as we move to infinity.

Cullen primes
Numbers of the form Cn = n  2n + 1 are named after the Reverend J.
Cullen, who noticed in 1905 that apart from C1 = 3 and one other
possible exception, they are all composite for n = 1 to 100. The
exception was C53, which was found by Cunningham to be divisible
by 5591.
Although for low values of n, Cullen primes are rare, it has been
conjectured that there is an infinite number of them.
The known Cullen primes occur when n = 1, 141, 4713, 5795, 6611,
18496, 32292, 32469, 59656, 90825, 262419, 361275, and 481899.
Numbers of the form n  bn + 1, called generalized Cullen numbers,
are also rarely prime.
When b = 3, n  3n + 1 is prime for n = 2, 8, 32, 54, 114, 414, 1400,
1850, 2848, 4874, 7268, 19290.
The largest known Cullen prime is C481899 of 145,072 digits, discov-
ered by Masakatu Morii in 1998.
See Woodall primes
Cunningham project
Lieutenant Colonel Allan Joseph Cunningham (1842–1928) retired
from the British army in 1891 and devoted himself to number theory,
especially the factorization of numbers of the form an  bn.
In 1925 he got together with H. J. Woodall to publish a book of
all that they had discovered about the factors of such numbers. 
D. H. Lehmer devoted much time to extending their results, in what
is now called the Cunningham project. Of course, there were many
numbers in their tables that at the time could not be factored with
34 • Cullen primes

the equipment available. D. H. Lehmer and Emma Lehmer factored
many of them. The last number in the original book was factored
in 1992.
The project is continuing. The results of the Cunningham project
were originally collected in J. Brillhart et al., Factorizations of bn  1,
b = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 up to high powers, published by the Amer-
ican Mathematical Society in 1988. The results are now on the Web,
where they are regularly updated at this site run by Stan Wagstaff:
www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/ssw/cun. This site includes a calcu-
lator that gives the known prime factors of the numbers bn  1
(where b = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
See GIMPS; Mersenne primes
Cunningham chains
If p and 2p + 1 are both prime, then p is a Sophie Germain prime. A
Cunningham chain is a chain of Sophie Germain primes, apart from
the last prime in the chain. Two small examples: 2, 5, 11, 23, 47; and
89, 179, 359, 719, 1439, 2879.
These are sometimes called Cunningham chains of the first kind, to
distinguish them from Cunningham chains of the second kind, in
which all the terms are prime and each is double the previous prime,
less 1: for example, 2, 3, 5; or 19, 37, 73.
If the strong prime k-tuples conjecture is true, then Cunningham
chains can reach any length.
Tony Forbes found on December 5, 1997, the longest Cunningham
chain of the first kind, with 14 terms, and the longest of the second
kind, of length 16, starting with 3203000719597029781.
The largest chain of the first kind of length 3 starts at
115566729.24319 −1, and the largest of the second kind of length 3
starts at 734257203.25000 + 1, both discovered by Warut Roonguthai. It
is no coincidence that both feature numbers of the form k  2n  1.
Although any odd number can be expressed in these forms, if k < 2n
then the number can be tested for primality very efficiently. Since 
2(k  2n −1) + 1 = k  2n + 1 −1, a Cunningham chain may consist of
a sequence of terms of this form. Similarly, 2(k  2n + 1) −1 = k 
2n + 1 + 1, leading naturally to chains of the second kind.

decimals, recurring (periodic)
The fraction 1/7 as a decimal is 0.142857 142857 . . . The number
142857 has many curious properties, often shared (more or less) with
the periods of other primes. For example, splitting the period in two
halves or three thirds:
142 + 857 = 999, and 14 + 28 + 57 = 99
Square and split into halves and add: 1428572 = 20,408,122,449, and:
20,408 + 122,449 = 142857
Multiplying 142857 by any number from 2 to 6 results in a permuta-
tion of its digits:
142857  2 = 285714
142857  3 = 428571
142857  4 = 571428
142857  5 = 714285
142857  6 = 857142
But,
142857  7 = 999999
the period of 1/13
The fraction 1/13 = 0.076923 076923 . . . has period length 6 = (13 −
1)/2. These properties match those of 1/7:
076 + 923 = 999
07 + 69 + 23 = 99
The second property needs only to be slightly adjusted:
0769232 = 005,917,147,929, and adding the six-digit split halves we get,
005,917 + 147,929 = 153,846 = 2  076923
The third property is also somewhat different. Multiplying 076923 by
the numbers 2 to 12:
076923  2
= 153846
076923  3
= 230769

076923  10 = 769230
076923  11 = 846153
076923  12 = 923076
36 • decimals, recurring (periodic)

Five of the products are cyclic permutations of 076923 but the other
six are cyclic permutations 153846. 
We can put them into a simpler sequence if we start with 076923
and just double and double again, reducing modulo 13, so that 16  3
(mod 13) and 32  6 (mod 13) and so on. The sequence of multiples
from 2 to 12 then reads: 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 11, 9, 5, 10, 7, and the prod-
ucts are cyclic permutations of 07923 and 153846 alternately.
The decimal reciprocals of composite numbers are, naturally, more
complicated and less obviously elegant. For example, 1/21 =
0.047619 and 047619  21 = 999999 and 04 + 76 + 19 does equal 99—
but 047 + 619 = 666, not 999.

If the period of a prime p is of length p −1, it is a full period prime
(also called a reptend or long prime). In all other cases the period
length is a factor of n −1, as Lambert noticed in 1769.
Artin’s conjecture
Thirty-eight of the first hundred primes are full period, starting with
7, 17, 19, 23, 29, 47, 59, 61, . . . but no general method is known for
deciding which primes are full period.
There is a connection here with primitive roots: if p is a prime less
than 5, then the decimal expansion of 1/p has the maximum possi-
ble period of p −1 in base 10 if and only if 10 is a primitive root
modulo p.
Roughly, it seems by calculation that 37% of all primes in base 10
are full period. Emil Artin conjectured that the exact figure should be,
for any base at all:
× . . . = 0.3739558 . . . = C
The fractions are ( p2 −p −1)/( p2 −p) for each prime, 2, 3, 5, . . .
D. H. and Emma Lehmer then discovered experimentally that Artin’s
conjecture is not quite right. It requires a correcting factor that
depends on the base. In base 7, for example, the proportion is con-
jectured to be 42C/41.
the repunit connection
There is a simple connection between reciprocal prime periods and
the repunits, numbers whose digits are all 1, which we can illustrate
with the cases of 1/7 and 1/13:
1/7 
= 0.142857 142857 . . .
and
7  1/7
= 1 = 0.999999 999999 . . .
so,
7  142857 = 999999 = 9  111111
Similarly,
1/13 
= 0.076923 076923 . . .
and
13  1/13 
= 1 = 0.999999 999999 . . .
so,
13  076923 = 999999 = 9  111111

In other words, all the integers whose reciprocals have period 6 must
divide 999999 = 33  7  11  13  37. As it happens, 3, 11, and 37 have
periods less than 6, so only 1/7 and 1/13 actually have period 6. Sim-
ilarly, since 111,111,111 = 3  3  37  333667, the only prime with re-
ciprocal period length 9 is 333667. These primes have unique period
lengths: 3, 11, 37, 101, 333667, 9091, 9901, 909091, R19, R23, 99990001,

decimals, recurring (periodic) • 39

The row, column, and diagonal sums are all 81. Notice the patterns
in the first and last columns. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
deficient number
A number is deficient if the sum of its proper divisors, meaning all its
divisors except the number itself is less than the number: so all prime
numbers are deficient.
The number 8 is deficient, because 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. In fact, all pow-
ers of 2 are deficient just because the proper factors of 2n are 1, 2, 4,
8, . . . , 2n −1 and 1 + 2 + 4 + . . . + 2n −1 = 2n −1. The powers of primes
greater than 2 are even more deficient.
The opposite of a deficient number is an abundant number.
See abundant number; perfect number
deletable and truncatable primes
Chris Caldwell defines a deletable prime to be one that remains
prime as the digits are deleted in some chosen order. This is his
example: 410256793, 41256793, 4125673, 415673, 45673, 4567, 467,
67, 7. It is not known whether there is an infinity of such primes.
truncatable primes
A right-truncatable number is prime and remains prime as the digits
are removed from the right. It therefore contains no zero digit, and
the digits 2 and 5 can only be the leftmost digit.
There are eighty-three right-truncatable primes in base 10, starting,
2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 29, 31, 37, 53, 59, 71, 73, 79, 233, 239, 293, 311, 313,
317, 373, . . .
There is an infinity of left-truncatable primes if zeros are allowed;
for example, 1087. If zeros are disallowed, there are 4,260 left-
truncatable primes in base 10, starting 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47,
53, 67, 73, 83, 97, 113, 137, 167, 173, . . .
Demlo numbers
The original Demlo numbers are the palindromes 1, 121, 12321,
1234321, 123454321, . . . , 12345678987654321. The problem is then,
40 • deficient number

Dickson’s conjecture • 41
how to continue the sequence?—and the usual solution is to notice
that the Demlo numbers are the squares of the first few repunits:
112
= 121
1112 = 12321
11112 = 1234321
. . .
R9
2 = 1111111112 = 12345678987654321
This suggests that Demlo-10 should be defined as,
R10
2 = 11111111112 = 1234567900987654321
and so on.
descriptive primes
In a descriptive (or self-descriptive or Look and Say) sequence, each
term describes the previous term. For example,
2
12
1112
3112
one 2
one 1, one 2
three 1s, one 2 . . .
Starting with 1, the sequence continues 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221,
312211, 13112221, . . . The first two primes are 11 and 312211.
Are there descriptive sequences whose terms are all prime? G. L.
Honaker Jr. found this one: 373, 131713, 111311171113, 311331173113.
Unfortunately, the next term is composite. Carlos Rivera, Mike Keith,
and Walter Schneider have subsequently found six-term sequences,
and Schneider has found a seven-term sequence starting with
19,972,667,609. (Schneider 2003) (Rivera, Puzzle 36)
Dickson’s conjecture
Leonard Eugene Dickson (1874–1954) is best known today for his
extraordinarily detailed three-volume History of the Theory of Num-
bers, whose first volume is on Divisibility and Primality. He conjec-
tured in 1904 that if we have a sequence of linear expressions with
integer coefficients, with all the ai positive,
a1n + b1, a2n + b2, a3n + b3, . . . , akn + bk

then there is infinite number of values of n for which every one of these
expressions will be prime simultaneously (apart from cases where
there is a number which divides at least one the expressions for every
value of n). The qualification is necessary to exclude cases such as,
2n + 3
2n + 5
2n + 7
one of which must always be divisible by 3: the first if 3|n, the sec-
ond if 3|n + 1, the third if 3|n −1.
Dickson’s general conjecture includes many others: the twin primes
conjecture is the case for n and n + 2. If it is true for n and 2n + 1,
then there is an infinity of Sophie Germain primes. It also implies, if
true, the prime k-tuples conjecture; that there are infinitely many
triples of consecutive semiprimes; and that there is an infinity of
composite Mersenne numbers.

digit properties
The largest prime using the digits 1 to 9 is 98765431. If 0 can be used
as well, it is 987654103.
• 8757193191 is the largest prime such that the first n digits are
divisible by the nth prime, for n = 1 to 10. (Mike Keith: Cald-
well, Prime Pages)
• 113 is the smallest three-digit prime such that all rearrangements
of its digits are also prime. The others are 337 and 199. The
repunits R19 and R23 are the next numbers with this property.
• 200 is the least number that cannot become a prime by chang-
ing one digit. With 202, 204, 206, and 208 it forms an arith-
metic progression of numbers with the same property.
See deletable and truncatable primes
Diophantus (c. AD 200; d. 284)
Diophantus was one of the great late Greek mathematicians. Six
books of his Arithmetica, out of thirteen, are extant. He also wrote
On Polygonal Numbers.
42 • digit properties

The Arithmetica is a collection of solved problems, including
this one: which numbers can be the hypotenuse of a right-angled
triangle?
According to Pythagoras’s theorem, in a right-angled triangle a2 +
b2 = c2. The simplest example is 32 + 42 = 52 and the next simplest is
52 + 122 = 132. The general formula for solutions to Pythagoras’s
equation is:
a = m2 −n2
b = 2mn
c = m2 + n2
If m and n have no common factor, then a, b, and c will be coprime
also.
From the specific examples that Diophantus chose in solving his
problems, critics have concluded that he knew that any prime num-
ber of the form 4n + 1 is a possible hypotenuse, meaning that it is of
the form x 2 + y 2.
He also knew that no number of the form 4n + 3 is the sum of two
squares, and numbers of the form 8n + 7 are not the sum of three
squares, though any number is the sum of up to four squares.
His Arithmetica includes the problem of representing numbers as the
sum of two squares, which were rational rather than integral, for
example:
x 2 + y 2 = 13, with x 2 and y 2 greater than 6
He finds the solution is (257/101)2 and (258/101)2, which is equiva-
lent to 2572 + 2582 = 13  1012, an impressive feat! (Today, ironically,
“Diophantine” means soluble in integers only.)
He also used relationships such as 8 times a triangular number + 1 =
a square number; m2 + n2  2mn is a square; the sum of two cubes
is also the difference of two cubes (rational rather than integral); and
(m2 −n2)2 + (2mn)2 = (m2 + n2)2. This last represents the sides of a
right-angled Pythagorean triangle.
He also used the formulae,
(a2 + b2)(c2 + d 2) = (ac + bd)2 + (ad −bc)2
and
(a2 + b2)(c2 + d 2) = (ac −bd)2 + (ad + bc)2
Diophantus (c. AD 200; d. 284) • 43

which he used to find four right-angled triangles with the same
hypotenuse. For example,
(12 + 22)(32 + 12) = (1  3 + 2  1)2 + (1  1 −2  3)2 = 52 + 52 = 50
and so 
(12 + 22)(32 + 12) = (1  3 −2  1)2 + (1  1 + 2  3)2 = 12 + 72 = 50
These algebraic identities are more than a curiosity. They make a
crucial and deep link between “being a sum of two squares” and fac-
tors and products, and they suggest questions such as:
A. Can the factors of any composite number that is the sum of
two squares be written themselves as the sum of two squares?
B. Can a prime number that has no proper factors be written
as the sum of two squares?
C. In how many ways can a number with three factors, each of
which is the sum of two squares, be written as the sum of two
squares?
The works of Diophantus were published by, among others, Bachet
de Méziriac in 1621, whose book was studied by Fermat.
The questions proposed and answered by Diophantus provide a link
from Pythagoras and the earliest Greek mathematics to Fermat and
other mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
who made these the first deep problems in modern number theory.

Dirichlet’s theorem and primes 
in arithmetic series
Gustav Peter Lejeune Dirichlet (1805–1859) was a prodigy who as a
young man carried with him on his travels his dog-eared copy of
Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. At the age of only twenty, he
presented to the French Academy of Sciences a paper on equations
of the form,
x 5 + y 5 = A  z 5
A few weeks later he proved that Fermat’s Last Theorem when n = 5
has no solution.
Euclid proved that there is an infinity of primes among the positive
integers, but how many are there in arithmetic progressions such as

Dirichlet proved in 1837, a conjecture made by Gauss: if a and b are
coprime positive integers, then the arithmetic progression a, a + b, 
a + 2b, a + 3b, . . . contains infinitely many primes. He did so by prov-
ing that if p is a prime of the form an + b, with a and b coprime, then
the sum of all the primes p of this form less than x is approximately,
 log log x
as x tends to infinity. In other words, it increases without limit, albeit
very slowly, and so the primes of that form cannot be finite in num-
ber. He also proved that the number of primes in the sequence less
than n tends to
as n increases.
This proof represented the birth of analytic number theory, which
uses calculus to draw conclusions about the integers.
Where does the first prime occur in an arithmetic sequence? See Lin-
nik’s constant for a partial answer.
primes in polynomials
Dirichlet also proved that if a, 2b, and c have no common prime fac-
tor, then the quadratic expression ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 takes an infinity
of prime values.

distributed computing
How much of the power of your computer do you actually use?
Almost certainly, very little. One way to use the “wasted” power is to
get together with other computer users, take a very difficult problem
that can be split into many smaller problems—and distributed via the
Internet—and tackle one small problem each. That’s distributed
computing!

You might be able to crack a very difficult code, analyze geologi-
cal data, or calculate the shapes of molecules—or you could attempt
to communicate with an alien civilization by joining the SETI@home
project searching for signs of life in signals from the radio telescope
at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico: so far more than 70,000
enthusiasts have signed up.
The biggest number-theoretic opportunities include factoring very
large numbers and finding record-breaking prime numbers. Arjen
Lenstra and Mark Manasse organized the first Internet factoring proj-
ect in 1988. Soon their volunteers were factoring 100-digit numbers
with ease, and in 1993 a team of six hundred successfully factored
RSA-129 for a prize of $100, and rather more glory.
Among the many projects now running, the distributed computing
search for Fermat number divisors has its Web address www
.fermatsearch.org/particip. Twenty-eight researchers from Brazil, Fin-
land, Germany, Greece, Iran, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Russia,
and the USA are taking part, including Tony Forbes, author of the
MFAC program that was used to find a factor of F31.
Tony Forbes is also organizing an international search for a factor
of MM61 = 2M61 −1. This is a Mersenne number with a Mersenne
prime exponent, and the smallest whose primality has not been
decided.
The Sierpinski numbers offer another challenge. In March 2002 there
were only seventeen candidate values of k left to check: 4847, 5359,
10223, 19249, 21181, 22699, 24737, 27653, 28433, 33661, 44131,
46157, 54767, 55459, 65567, 67607, and 69109. So Louis K. Helm and
David A. Norris started their “Seventeen or Bust” project. By the end

The goal of ZetaGrid, organized by Sebastian Wedeniwski of IBM, is
to calculate zeros of the Riemann zeta function. So far they have cal-
culated nearly 400 billion. Currently, ZetaGrid links more than 10,000
workstations, has a performance rate of about 5649 GFLOPS, and
calculates more than 1 billion zeta function zeros every day.
Not surprisingly, distributed computing can be highly competitive!
According to the ZetaGrid Web site, the Top Team for the “last 7

Everywhere,” with two active members, and thirty-six computers that
calculated 321,992,600 zeros.
If mere glory doesn’t grab you, then there are prizes. ZetaGrid is
offering the following four prizes in accordance with [these] rules:
• $10 (USD) will be awarded to the first person who discovers
the first two zeros that have a distance less than 10−6, using the

• $100 (USD) will be awarded to the first person who discovers
the first two zeros that have a distance less than 10−7, using the
software provided by ZetaGrid.
• $1,000 (USD) will be awarded to the first person who discov-
ers a nontrivial zero that is not on the critical line, using the
software provided by ZetaGrid, but only if this constitutes the
first disproof of the Riemann hypothesis by any method.
• Up to $1 million (USD) will be awarded to the first 100 top

divisibility tests
An integer in base 10 is divisible by 2 if the last digit is even; by 3 if
3 divides the sum of the digits; by 9 if 9 divides the sum of the dig-
its; and by 5 if the last digit is 5 or 0.
There are many tests for divisibility by 7, none of them very short.
Here are two:
1. Multiply the left-hand digit by 3 and add to the next digit.
Reduce the answer modulo 7 (meaning, take only the remainder
when it is divided by 7). Repeat. If the final answer is divisible by
7, so was the original number.
Example: 6475: 6  3 + 4 = 22, which reduces to 1; then 3  1 + 7 = 10, reduc-
ing to 3; then 3  3 + 5 = 14, which is a multiple of 7.
2. Double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining
number. Repeat. If the final result is 0 or 7, the original number
is divisible by 7.
Example: 1106 →110 −12 = 98 →9 −16 = −7
Example: 37989 →3798 −18 = 3780 →378 →37 −16 = 21
So both numbers are divisible by 7.
There are simple tests for some other numbers. For example, 100a +
b is divisible by 19 if and only if a + 4b is, because 4(100a + b) =
400a + 4b  a + 4b (mod 19). If you test a number that cycles, such as,
1064 →10 + 256 = 266 →2 + 4  66 = 266 . . .
repeating, endlessly, then you’re okay; the original number is divisi-
ble by 19 (1064 = 19  56).
divisors (factors)
Man has long been aware that some numbers are more readily
divided into parts than others, and that this can be a source of con-
venience. The Babylonians divided the sky and the circle into 360
degrees—suggested, plausibly, by the 3651⁄4 days in the year—the
day into 12 hours, the hour into 60 minutes, and they counted in 60s.
Plato in Book V of his Laws claims, “There is no difficulty in per-
ceiving that the twelve parts admit of the greatest number of divi-
sions of that which they include, or in seeing the other numbers
48 • divisibility tests

which are consequent upon them,” and he went on to argue that in
his ideal republic,
The number of our citizens shall be 5040, this will be a convenient num-
ber. . . . Every legislator ought to know so much arithmetic as to be able to
tell what number is most likely to be useful to all cities; and we are going
to take that number which contains the greatest and most regular and
unbroken series of divisions. The whole of number has every possible divi-
sion, and the number 5040 can be divided by exactly fifty-nine divisors
[sixty including itself], and ten of these proceed without interval from one
to ten; this will furnish numbers for war and peace, and for all contracts and
dealing, including taxes and divisions of the land.
When the ancient Greeks first considered abundant, perfect, and
deficient numbers, they tended to think of divisors as being less than
the number, so the number itself was excluded: 28 was perfect
because 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
However, there is a very good and typically logical reason for
including n when calculating d(n). The function d(n) is multiplica-
tive, meaning that provided a and b are coprime, then d(ab) =
d(a)d(b). So d(n) can easily be calculated for any number whose
prime factors are known. If we exclude the number itself, so we are
considering d(n) −n, this is not multiplicative, and all our calcula-
tions become more complicated.
how many divisors? how big is d(n)?
A prime number, p, has two divisors, 1 and p. Powers of 2, 2n, have
n + 1 divisors, 1, 2, 4, . . . , 2n, and the product of three distinct
primes, pqr, has eight factors: 1, p, q, r, qr, rp, pq, pqr.
In general, if n is written as the product of prime factors: n =
paqbr c . . . then the number of divisors, d(n) = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) . . .
Since half of all integers are divisible by 2, and a third by 3, and so on,
we might think that most integers have quite a few divisors. This is
false. The opposite, correct argument is that half of all integers are
even, 1 in 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, 1 in 12 by 2, 3, and 4, only 1 in 30
is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, and only 1 in 210 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and
7. So numbers with even a handful of small divisors are infrequent.
In fact, G. H. Hardy proved that a “typical” number, n, has about log
log n divisors. Only a tiny proportion has many more divisors than this.
The typical integer round about 108 has just three prime factors, and you
have to go up to about 1070 to get an average of five prime factors.
divisors (factors) • 49

The sum of the number of divisors of all the numbers up to n, d(1) +
d(2) + d(3) + . . . + d(n) is approximately n log n. More precisely it
equals n(log n + 2γ −1) as n tends to infinity, where γ is Euler’sconstant.
record numbers of divisors
We reach a record with d(n) whenever we get to the smallest num-
ber with a given number of divisors. This, apart from 1, is always of
the form 2a  3b  5c  7d . . . where a ≥b ≥c ≥d . . . The sequence of
such numbers starts,

curiosities of d(n)

divisors is 2 and 3, with two each. The subsequent pairs start,

Larger examples are 242 to 245, all with d(n) = 6, and 11605
to 11609, with d(n) = 8. (Rivera: Caldwell, Prime Pages)
• The product nd(n) has equal values for each of the triplet 168,
192, and 224. There are three smaller pairs for which nd(n)
has the same values: 18 and 27; 24 and 32; 56 and 64. (Guy
1981, 68)
50 • divisors (factors)

• The product of the harmonic mean and arithmetic mean of
the divisors of a number is the number itself. For example, 20
has divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. The harmonic mean is the rec-
iprocal of (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/10 + 1/20)/6 = 21⁄10/6 =
7/20. So the harmonic mean is 20/7. The arithmetic mean is
42/6 = 7.
• Call the maximum power of a prime that divides N a principal
divisor of N. So 3 and 4 are principal divisors of 12. Then any
odd integer N greater than 15 that is not a prime power is greater
than twice the sum of its principal divisors. (Alspach 2004)
divisors and congruences
The simplest conclusions about divisibility come from looking at
remainders. For example, the remainders when 2n is divided by 7 are
only ever 1, 2, or 4. In other words,
2n  1, 2, or 4 (mod 7)
It follows that 2n + k can only be divisible by 7 when k = 6, 5, or 3.
For each value of n, only one of these will apply. For example, 27 =
128 and 7 divides 128 + 5 = 133.
Similarly, the first seven values of x2 + 3x + 5 are:
x

2
3

x2 + 3x + 5

(mod 7)
So x 2 + 3x + 5  1, 2, 3, or 5 (mod 7) and its values are never divis-
ible by 7.
the sum of divisors function
The sum of all the d(n) divisors of n is written σ(n). Like d(n), σ(n)
is multiplicative: if p and q are coprime, then σ(pq) = σ(p)σ(q).
If p is prime, then σ(p) = p + 1, so if n = paq br c . . . then,
σ(n) = (pa + 1 −1)(qb + 1 −1)(r c + 1 −1) . . . /(p −1)(q −1)(r −1) . . .
The sequence of integers that are never values of σ(n) starts:
2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29,
33, 34, 35, 37, 41, 43, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, . . .
(Sloane A007369)
σ(n) is odd if and only if n is a square or double a square.

the size of s(n)
For all n > 1,
< 1
and for all n except n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12,
< 6/π2
(Annapurna 1938)
As n tends to infinity, σ(n) is of the order of n log log n. The upper
limit of σ(n)/n log log n as n tends to infinity is eγ, where γ is Euler’s
constant.
The sum of the divisors σ(n) does not jump around as much as
d(n), and the sum σ(1) + σ(2) + σ(3) + σ(4) + . . . + σ(n) is even
smoother: it is approximately equal to π2n2/12 plus a factor that is
proportional to n log n.
For example, the sum σ(1) + σ(2) + σ(3) + . . . + σ(1000) = 823081
and π210002/12 = 822467 to the nearest integer. (Lehmer 1940)
a recursive formula
Euler discovered an extraordinary and exquisite recursive formula
for calculating σ(n):
σ(n) = σ(n −1) + σ(n −2) −σ(n −5) −σ(n −7) + σ(n −12) +
σ(n −15) −σ(n −22) −σ(n −26) + σ(n −35) + σ(n −40) . . .
You stop when you reach negative values, since σ(−x) is not defined.
If you reach d(0), then σ(0) = n for the sake of this formula.
Euler found the sequence involved, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 22, 26, 35, 40,
51, 57, 70, . . . by multiplying out,
(1 −x)(1 −x 2)(1 −x 3)(1 −x 4) . . .
= 1 −x −x 2 + x 5 + x 7 −x 12 −x 15 . . .
The sequence can also be derived from the pentagonal numbers.
Their formula is 1⁄2n(3n −1), and their values for positive and nega-
tive values of n go like this:
n

in which the counting numbers and the odd numbers from 3 alter-

Here’s an example of how it works:
σ(10) = σ(10 −1) + σ(10 −2) −σ(10 −5) −σ(10 −7)
= σ(9) + σ(8) −σ(5) −σ(3)
= 13 + 15 −6 −4
= 18
It is thought-provoking that although σ(n) apparently depends on
the factors of n, it can also be calculated via the factors of a selection
of numbers less than n.
divisors and partitions
Even more surprisingly, almost exactly the same formula, with the
same condition on stopping, gives the number of partitions of n:
p(n) = p(n −1) + p(n −2) −p(n −5) −p(n −7) + p(n −12) 
+ p(n −15) −p(n −22) −p(n −26) + p(n −35) + p(n −40) . . .
The only difference is that if you reach p(0) this is given the value 1.
Here is another connection: take any number, and write down its par-
titions into an odd number of different positive integers, for example,
11 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 1 + 3 + 7 = 1 + 4 + 6 = 2 + 3 + 6 = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
Add the first terms: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 11 = 18.
Now partition 11 into even numbers of different positive integers:
11 = 1 + 10 = 2 + 9 = 3 + 8 = 4 + 7 = 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5
Add the first terms: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 16. The difference, 18 −
16 = 2, which is d(11). This is a general result. (Bing, Fokkink, and
Fokkink 1995)
curiosities of s(n)
• The equation σ(n) = σ(n + 1) has only nine solutions in pos-
itive integers less than 10,000. They are n = 14, 206, 957, 1334,
1364, 1634, 2685, 2974, and 4364.

• The equation σ(n) + 2 = σ(n + 2) is satisfied whenever n and
n + 2 are a prime pair, but there are three other solutions for
n under 9998: n = 434, 8575, and 8825. (Makowski 1960)
• The values of σ(n) peak at those n that have many small fac-
tors. The peak at σ(60) = 168 beats the previous peak of 
σ(48) = 124 by 44. The next record-breaking difference is
between the peaks at σ(108) = 280 and σ(120) = 360.
prime factors
• The probability that the greatest prime factor of a random inte-
ger n is greater than n is log 2.
• The probability that a number N, chosen at random, has a
prime factor between N a and N a (1 + e) is approximately equal to
e, independently of the size of a, provided that e is small.
(Riesel 1994, 161)
• The group 64, 65, 66 is the smallest triple of integers with,
respectively, one, two, and three distinct prime factors. The next
is 103, 104, 105, followed by 163, 164, 165 and 193, 194, 195.
• If n is greater than 239, then the largest prime factor of n2 + 1
is at least 17. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
• The number 140 is the start of the smallest sequence of seven
consecutive integers each with an even number of prime factors.
• The number 170 is the start of the same record for an odd
number of prime factors. (Honaker: Caldwell, Prime Pages)
• Six consecutive integers, beginning with 788, are divisible by
the first six prime numbers, respectively.
• The triples 3, 4, 5 and 8, 9, 10 are the smallest non-overlapping
sets of consecutive numbers sharing the same set of prime fac-
tors: 2, 3, and 5. Erdös has conjectured that there is only a
finite number of such sets.

economical numbers
If a number written as the product of its prime factors has no more
digits than the number itself, the number is labeled economical. The
sequence of economical numbers starts: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, . . .
If it requires fewer digits, it is frugal; if it requires the same number,
equidigital; and if it requires more, it is extravagant.
Frugal numbers, not surprisingly, are relatively scarce. According
to Santos and Pinch the numbers of each kind for 2 ≤n ≤
500,000,000 are:
frugal
1,455,952
equidigital
86,441,875

412,102,173
Five sequences of seven economical numbers start at 157, 108749,
109997, 121981, and 143421. There is a sequence of length nine start-
ing at 1034429177995381247. Pinch has checked up to 106 and only
found pairs of consecutive frugal numbers, including 4374 = 2  37
and 4375 = 7  54.
However, Pinch has also proved that if Dickson’s conjecture is cor-
rect, then there are sequences of consecutive frugal numbers of any
specified length. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)

elliptic curve primality proving
The elliptic curve method for factorization and primality testing
depends on an unusual property of a special type of curve. Elliptic
curves were first studied in attempts to find the arc-length of an
ellipse. Their equations have the form,
y 2 = x 3 + ax + b
Provided 4a3 + 27b2 is not zero, the curve looks like the figure on page
57; cutting the x-axis at three points, the real roots of x3 + ax + b = 0.
The unusual property is that we can “add” any two points on the
curve to get a third point. We do it by drawing a line through the
points we wish to add, such as A and B, and finding where this line
meets the curve again, at C′. We then reflect C′ in the x-axis to
obtain the “sum” A + B = C.
There seems to be an exception to this possibility when the points
A and B lie on a vertical line. However, we get around that apparent
difficulty by the typically mathematical tactic of defining a point at
infinity, denoted by ∞.
This process of “addition” has all the properties of a mathematical
group, so we can drop the quotation marks and simply think of
group addition defined on the points of the curve, with these group
properties:
1. If A and B are points on the curve, then A + B = C is on the
curve.
56 • elliptic curve primality proving

2. (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). This is the associative property.
3. There is an identity element such that when added to any
point A, the result is A. In this case the identity is the point 
at infinity, ∞, because according to our definition, A + ∞= ∞+
A = A.
4. There is an inverse for each point, so that given A we can
find A′ such that A + A′ = ∞. This is so because A′ is simply the
point where the vertical line through A cuts the curve again.
The properties of this group can now be used to test primality and to
find factors. Readers who wish to go further into this remarkable
method will find excellent accounts in Bressoud (1989) and Crandall
and Pomerance (2001).

An emirp is a prime number that gives a different prime when the
order of the digits is reversed. Palindromic primes are not included.

Eratosthenes of Cyrene, the sieve of
Eratosthenes (271–194 BC) was chief librarian at the famous Library
of Alexandria. He calculated the circumference of the earth—252,000
stadia or about 24,662 miles, which was amazingly (and somewhat
fortuitously) accurate—and invented his famous sieve for finding the
prime numbers.
This is the most efficient way to list all the primes up to a few mil-
lion: simply list them, and then strike out every second number; 3 is
the first number missed out, so leave 3 but strike out every third
number thereafter; 5 is the next number still missed out, so leave 5
and strike out every fifth number, and so on.
By arranging the numbers in this array, the numbers struck out
form straight lines, which saves time spent on counting forward, and
is a check that you have not made an error. The sequence of prime
numbers appears, without any division and almost no multiplication.
To sieve all the primes up to N, you stop when you reach the largest
prime less than or equal to N
, which does need one multiplication.
The process of striking out also reveals at least one of the factors of
each composite number.
Basically the same method can be used to find all the primes in any
interval.

Schuler has calculated that 90.0037183% of all numbers greater than
2572 are composite, with a smallest prime factor less than or equal 
to 257.
By cunning variations on Erastosthenes’s basic idea, much more
sophisticated sieve methods can be used. Viggo Brun introduced
modern sieves in 1920, in a paper titled “The Sieve of Erastosthenes
and the Theorem of Goldbach.” He proved all these results:
1. If n is sufficiently large, then between n and n + n there
is a number with at most eleven prime factors.
2. Every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as
the sum of two numbers each having no more than nine prime
factors.
3. There exists infinitely many pairs of numbers, having differ-
ence 2, of which the number of prime factors does not exceed
nine.
4. For sufficiently large x, the number of prime twins not
exceeding x does not exceed 100x/log2x.
These results are very far from being the best possible, but as so
often in number theory, weak results are (mathematicians hope) a
step in the right direction. The strongest version of (1.) is that there
is a prime between n and n + n. Chen proved in 1975 that there is
a semiprime between n and n + n. Point (2.) is a weak version of
Goldbach’s conjecture, and (3.) is a weak version of the twin primes
conjecture. (Greaves 2001)

is going on with the prime numbers.

Paul Erdös was one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth
century and one of the most prolific of all time, writing more than 
Erdös, Paul (1913–1996) • 59

fifteen hundred papers, with nearly five hundred collaborators, whom
he met as he wandered across the mathematical and geographical
world, stopping with friends or favored universities where he would
announce, “My brain is open!” He contributed especially to number
theory, set theory, graph theory, and combinatorics, which fitted his
cast of mind, and to probabilistic number theory, where the primes
are treated as if they were random.
He claimed, “A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into
theorems,” and he spent his adult life doing just that, working on
problems up to within hours of his death. He didn’t limit himself to
coffee, however. He also, in later life, took amphetamines. Erdös
often stayed with his close friend Ronald Graham and his wife, the
mathematician Mei Fang, and Graham once bet him $500 that he
could not give up amphetamines for a month. Graham lost. As Paul
Hoffman tells the story, Erdös told him, “You’ve showed me that I’m
not an addict. But I didn’t get any work done. I’d get up in the morn-
ing and stare at a blank piece of paper. I’d have no ideas, just like an
ordinary person. You’ve set mathematics back a month,” and he
went back to his pills. (Hoffman 1998, 16)
Erdös was also, perhaps, the most prolific problem poser ever. Not
infrequently he offered prize money, from a few dollars up to $1,000
or more for the solution to problems that intrigued him, the value of
the prize indicating his judgment of its difficulty. For example, he
offered a prize of $10 for an answer to the question: can σ(n)/n for
a weird number be as large as we choose?
For harder problems he offered more money. In 1936, Erdös and
Turán conjectured that any increasing sequence of integers that tends
to infinity no faster than some arithmetic progression contains arbi-
trarily long arithmetic progressions. Szemerédi proved that this is
true, in 1974, and won Erdös’s prize of $1,000, the largest sum he
ever had to actually pay out. (Bollobás 1998, 232)
Here is a related but harder problem. Suppose you have an infinite
sequence of integers, 1 ≤a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 . . . and suppose that the
sum of their reciprocals, 1/a1 + 1/a2 + 1/a3 + 1/a4 + . . . does not con-
verge. This means, very roughly speaking, that there are “quite a lot
of” the numbers. Must the sequence contain arbitrarily long arith-
metic progressions?
Since the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers converges,
an answer “yes” to this conjecture would prove, as a by-product, that
there are arithmetic progressions of primes as long as we choose. No

wonder that Erdös offered a prize of $3,000 in 1983, or that the con-
jecture has still not been settled, or that he remarked of the harder
demand that the primes should be consecutive, “This conjecture is
undoubtedly true but is completely unattackable by the methods at
our disposal.” (Erdös and Dudley 1983)
In 1990, in A Tribute to Paul Erdös, he presented “Some of my
favourite unsolved problems,” including this one: if dn = pn + 1 −pn is
the difference between successive primes, are there an infinity of n
for which dn < dn + 1 < dn + 2? Erdös was so certain this conjecture,
which he could not prove, was true that he offered $100 for a proof
but $25,000 for a disproof! (Baker, Bollobás, and Hajnal 1990, 469)
One day, Helmut Maier was giving Erdös a lift into town and men-
tioned a theorem he had just proved. “ ‘Maybe I offered a prize for
that,’ said Erdös, so of course they had to go to the library to check.
Yes, indeed, Erdös had offered $100 for a proof, and he paid up at
once. ‘That’s a pretty expensive taxi ride,’ remarked Maier, and Erdös
roared with laughter.” (Pomerance, quoted in Seife 2002)
Erdös was also a supporter of elementary methods: this does not
mean simple methods, but methods that do not use calculus. His very
first paper, published when he was nineteen, used elementary meth-
ods that an undergraduate could understand to prove Bertrand’s pos-
tulate.
In 1949 he and Atle Selberg found an elementary proof of the
prime number theorem that did without the analytical tools used by
Hadamard and Vallé Poussin. G. H. Hardy had previously said that
such a proof “seems to me extraordinarily unlikely.” The prime num-
ber theorem, Hardy thought, was extremely “deep,” but an elemen-
tary proof would show that this was false, and in consequence it
would be necessary for “the books to be cast aside and for the the-
ory to be rewritten.” Curiously, the proof by Erdös and Selberg did
not have this effect at all. (Hardy 1966)
his collaborators and Erdös numbers
Because he collaborated with so many colleagues, the idea of Erdös
numbers was invented. Mathematicians who have themselves col-
laborated with Erdös in writing a paper have Erdös number 1. Those
who have collaborated with an Erdös number 1 colleague have
Erdös number 2, and so on.
In 1996, 462 coauthors were listed, starting with George Szekeres
in 1934 with five joint papers and Paul Turán, also 1934, with thirty.
Erdös, Paul (1913–1996) • 61

By February 1999 the list had grown to 492 coauthors, and in Febru-
ary 2004 it was 509, partly because, like Euler, his papers have con-
tinued to be published after his death.
It is a well-known claim, sometimes called “Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon,” that anyone can be connected to anyone else in the world
by at most six links, so it is no surprise that many famous mathe-
maticians and even physicists, some now dead, can be connected 
to Erdös and have their own Erdös number. Richard Dedekind
(1831–1916) has Erdös number 7; Albert Einstein is a 2, Werner
Heisenberg and Paul Dirac are both 4; the economist Kenneth Arrow
is a 3, Noam Chomsky is 4, Stephen Hawking is also 4, and Bill Gates
is a 4. Ahmad Chalabi, who “helped” Bush and Blair to “justify” the
attack on Iraq, is a 6.
Here are just a handful, literally, of Erdös’s many results and conjec-
tures related to prime numbers:
There are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers, but
Erdös conjectured that there cannot be three consecutive powerful
numbers.
Erdös’s n −2k conjecture: if you subtract from n all the powers of 2
less than n, when are the results all prime? Erdös conjectured that n
must be 4, 7, 15, 21, 45, 75, or 105. Uchiyama and Yorinaga have ver-
ified this up to 277.
Erdös also conjectured that the same set of integers, n −2k, are
squarefree for infinitely many n.
There are infinitely many primes, p, such that every even number
less than p −2 can be expressed as the difference of two primes less
than or equal to p. For example, if p = 23,
2 = 19 −17
4 = 17 −13
6 = 17 −11
8 = 19 −11
10 = 17 −7
12 = 19 −7
14 = 19 −5
16 = 19 −3
18 = 23 −5
20 = 23 −3
This is a case where it would quite nice if 1 were counted as a prime:
then 22 = 23 −1, obviously!
If pn is the nth prime, as usual, this sequence converges:
−1⁄2 + 2⁄3 −3⁄5 + 4⁄7 −5⁄11 + 6⁄13 −7⁄17 + 8⁄19 −9⁄23 . . .

errors
In the eighteenth century, ideas of mathematical rigor were not well
developed, and a mathematician as brilliant as Euler could use, for
example, divergent series and draw conclusions that were usually
correct, because his intuition was so powerful, but also sometimes
wrong. So he claimed to have proved a version of the prime number
theorem, but erred because a series was not absolutely convergent.
(Erdös and Dudley 1983)
Making conjectures about the primes is especially easy and espe-
cially tempting, so in the history of the primes many conjectures have
turned out to be false. There have also been errors of calculation.
Carmichael thought in 1906 that he had proved that the values of
Euler’s totient function, φ (n), never occur once only, but the “proof”
contained an error, so in 1922 he published a correction and pre-
sented the problem as a conjecture—unproved to this day. Then in
1948 he published a correction of another claim in his original paper,
and in 1949 he published a list of misprints in the 1948 paper! (Klee
1969)
Tables of primes prior to the advent of modern computers
inevitably contained errors. Kulik constructed a table of the factors of
numbers up to 100,330,200, excluding multiples of 2, 3, and 5, titled
Magnus Canon Divisorum pro omnibus numeris per 2, 3 et 5 non
divisibilus, et numerorum primorum interfactentium ad millies cen-
tena millia accuratius as 100330201 usque. He spent twenty years
of life on this mammoth task, and when he died the manuscript was
deposited in the Academy of Sciences in Vienna. Unfortunately, D.N.
Lehmer found many mistakes in Kulik’s work. To add insult to injury,
the second of the eight volumes was already missing when D. N.
Lehmer checked the manuscript, and has never been found.
The Danish mathematician Bertelsen claimed in 1893 that there are
50,847,478 primes less than 109. In 1959, D. H. Lehmer gave the cor-
rect figure, 50,847,534.
Euler’s many volumes of collected papers contain a number of
errors. He once announced that 1000009 was prime, only to realize
his mistake later. We should sympathize: Euler was seventy at the
time, and had been blind for years. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
Stieltjes claimed in 1885 that he had proved the Riemann hypothesis,
but he didn’t publish his proof and died soon after in 1894 without
errors • 63

doing anything further to support his claim. It is very likely that his
proof contained an error—or did he see something that everyone
since has missed? (Apolstol 2000, 10)
Carmichael and Mason listed fifty multiperfect numbers, but they
mistakenly thought that 137561 = 151  911 and 485581 = 277  1753
were prime. (Guy 1994, 49)
More recently, a number of claimed results and proofs have turned
out to be wrong. You might think that mathematicians would be just
too careful to expose themselves to public humiliation, but, to be
fair, current proofs are getting more and more complex and with the
best will in the world, mistakes are easy to make.
Andrew Wiles announced in 1994 that he had proved Fermat’s Last
Theorem. The brilliant solution of a centuries-old problem made the
front pages—only for a gap to be spotted, which he and his col-
league Richard Taylor took more than a year to fill.
Carmichael’s totient function conjecture mentioned above claims
that the values of the Euler totient (phi) function are never unique.
Filip Saidak claimed to have proved the conjecture in 1997, but his
proof was erroneous.
Pogorzelski in 1977 thought he had proved Goldbach’s conjecture,
but “his proof is not generally accepted” by other number theorists.
(Weisstein, MathWorld: “Goldbach Conjecture”)
Dan Goldston and Cem Yildirim announced in 1985 that they had
made a giant step toward solving the twin primes conjecture. Soon
after, Andrew Granville and K. Soundararajan found an error. Gold-
ston and Yildirim’s conclusion depended on the size of the error
term in one of their formulae. They had believed that the error term
was bound to be especially small, making the formula especially
accurate. It wasn’t.

Euclid (c. 330–270 BC)
The Greek mathematician Euclid is most famous for writing his Ele-
ments, which systematically presented the elementary geometry of
his day, starting with axioms and postulates and then proving a long
sequence of theorems. It was so popular that it was still being used
as a school textbook in the early twentieth century. However, the
Elements also included basic number theory, in Book VII, proposi-
64 • Euclid (c. 330–270 BC)

tions 22–32, on prime numbers, and propositions 33–39, on least
common multiples, and in books VIII and IX.
unique factorization
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that each positive integer
can be expressed as the product of primes in essentially one way only.
For example,
4773 = 3  37  43
and,
6111 = 32  7  97
This conclusion is not as obvious as it seems. Suppose that we con-
sider only the even integers,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .
We can factorize 8 into 2  4, and similarly, 20 = 2  10. However, 10
has no factors within the set, because 1 and 5 are not in the set. The
“primes” within the set of even numbers are 2, 6, 10, 14, . . . (double
the usual primes) and the composites are 4, 8, 12, . . .
It now turns out that 60 = 2  30 and 60 = 6  10, two distinct fac-
torizations into “prime” numbers!
Another example consists of the ordinary integers with multiples of
6 added. So some sample integers in the set are 1 + 6, 7 −26,
4 + 36, and so on.
In this system of numbers it can be proved that 2 and 5 are prime,
and so 10 = 2  5 is a prime factorization of 10. But we might also
notice that 10 = (4 + 6)(4 −6), which is another factorization, in
which neither 2 nor 5 divide 4 + 6 or 4 −6.
The fundamental theorem was eventually stated, clearly and explic-
itly and rather late in the day, by Gauss, but Euclid got very close.
Book IX, proposition 14, states, “If a number be the least that is mea-
sured by prime numbers, it will not be measured by any other prime
number except those originally measuring it.” A number was “mea-
sured” by another if the other divided it without remainder, so this
sounds like the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Proposition 30 of
Book VII claims that if a prime measures the product of two integers,
then it must measure at least one of the integers. (Collison 1980)
2
 is irrational
No matter how many prime factors an integer n has, n2 will have an
even number. So the ratio of any two squares of integers also has an
Euclid (c. 330–270 BC) • 65

even number of prime factors, and since factorization into primes is
unique, there is no way that this can be changed to an odd number
of prime factors.
So no integer with an odd number of prime factors can be the
square of a rational number. In particular, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
,
13
, and 17
 are all irrational, as are all the square roots of the fol-
lowing primes. (And so are the cube roots, 4th roots, 5th roots, etc.)
Strangely, the Greek Theodorus, Plato’s tutor, followed Euclid and
proved that the roots from 3 up to 17
 were irrational—and then
stopped!
Euclid and the infinity of primes
Euclid in Book VII of his Elements defined a prime number as “that
which is measured by unity alone.” In Book IX he proved that the
number of primes is infinite, like this: start with the primes from 2 to
11, and calculate,
2  3  5  7  11 + 1 = 2311
The answer cannot be divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, and so it is
either prime itself or has at least two prime factors. (In fact it is
prime.) Either way, we have produced at least one prime greater
than 11.
Now assume that there are only a finite number of primes. Do the
same, multiplying them all together and adding 1. Once again we
shall create at least one new prime—which contradicts the assump-
tion that the number of primes is finite. Therefore it is infinite.
The same idea can be used to start from any set of primes and find
a prime not in the set. For example, we can calculate that,
2  5 + 11  17 = 217
Then either 217 is prime, or it has a prime factor that is not 2, 5, 11,
or 17. In fact 217 = 7  31.
Or we could take the first four primes, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and form
these sums and differences:
2  3  5  7 = 23, 37
3  5  7  2 = 103, 107
5  7  2  3 = 67, 73
7  2  3  5 = 37, 47
5  7  2  3 = 29, 41
3  7  2  5 = 11, 31
3  5  2  7 = 1, 29
Since 8, 9, and 10 are obviously divisible by either 2 or 3, any answer
that is less than 112 must be prime, or unity.
66 • Euclid (c. 330–270 BC)

The same calculation using 22, 3, 5, and 7 produces unity, plus the
primes 13, 23, 41, 43, 47, 53, 67, 79, 89, 101, 109, 137, and the prod-
uct of two new primes, 143 = 11  13.
consecutive composite numbers
Euclid’s idea also suggests how we can find strings of consecutive
composite numbers as long as we like. This expression, 
1  2  3  4  5  6  . . .  N + x
will be composite if x is any number from 2 to N. So if we want 100
consecutive composite numbers, 101! + x, x = 2 to 101 will do.
primes of the form 4n + 3
We can use Euclid’s method slightly adapted to prove that there is an
infinity of primes of the form 4n + 3.
The product of several numbers of the form 4n + 1 is always of the
same form, and the product of an odd number of numbers of the
form 4n + 3 is also of the form 4n + 3: but the product of an even
number of numbers of the form 4n + 3 is of the form 4n + 1.
Therefore, if we multiply, say, the first six terms in the 4n + 3
sequence,
3
7
11
19
23
31
43
47
. . .
and add 2:
3  7  11  19  23  31 + 2
we get a number of the form 4n + 3 that is not divisible by 3, 7, 11,
19, 23, or 31. Its prime factors cannot all be of the form 4n + 1, so at
least one factor must be a “new” prime of the form 4n + 3. Call it p,
and form the expression,
32  7  11  19  23  31  p + 2
Once again we have a product of an even number of numbers, 4n +
3, with a factor of that form. So there is an infinity of 4n + 3 primes.
Matching methods show that there is an infinity of primes of the
form 5n + 4, 8n + 3, 8n + 5, and 8n + 7. (Sierpinski)
a recursive sequence
Starting with any set of primes, we can multiply them together and
add 1; we then find the smallest prime factor of the result and add it
to the original list. Do this starting with 2 and we get this sequence:
2
3
7
43
13
53
5
. . .
Euclid (c. 330–270 BC) • 67

Which primes eventually appear in this sequence? The first prime
that has not yet appeared in any calculation of the sequence is 31.
Another way of showing that there is an infinity of primes is to pro-
duce an infinite sequence of relatively prime numbers. One example
is the Fermat numbers, Fn = 22n + 1. One of their properties is that 
Fm −2 = F0F1F2F3 . . . Fm −1. Since all Fm are odd, Fm has no factor in com-
mon with any of its predecessors, and so has a “new” prime factor.
Euclid and the first perfect number
Euclid showed in the Elements, Book IX proposition 36, that if 2n −1
is prime then 2n −1(2n −1) is a perfect number, equal to the sum of
all its proper divisors.
Euclidean algorithm
This is a method of finding the greatest common factor or divisor
(GCD) of two numbers. If the algorithm ends in 1, the original num-
bers are coprime. Euclid described it in his Elements, Book VII.
Let’s start with the numbers 4334 and 2838. By division, which in
this case is just subtraction,
4334 = 2838 + 1496
Continuing with 2838 and 1496,
2838 = 1496 + 1342
And so on:
1496 = 1342 + 154
1342 = 8 × 154 + 110
154 = 110 + 44
110 = 2 × 44 + 22
44 
= 2 × 22 + 0
The final remainder is 0, so the previous remainder, 22, is the great-
est common factor. In fact, 4334 = 2 × 11 × 197 and 2 × 3 × 11 × 43,
from which we see that the common prime factors are 2 and 11.
The algorithm works because the GCD divides all the remainders
from 1496 onward. If the smallest remainder is 1, then the numbers
are coprime. For example:
5077 = 6 × 813 + 199
813 = 4 × 199 + 17
68 • Euclid (c. 330–270 BC)

199 = 11 × 17 + 12
17 
= 12 + 5
12 
= 2 × 5 + 2
5 
= 2 × 2 + 1
Since we end up with the unit, 1, they are relatively prime. We could
have stopped as soon as we noticed that 17 and 12 are relatively
prime.
Lamé proved in 1844 that the Euclidean algorithm takes longest
when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783)
Till now mathematicians have tried in vain to this day to discover
some order in the sequence of prime numbers, and we have rea-
son to believe that it is a mystery into which the human mind will
never penetrate. To convince oneself, one has only to glance at
the tables of primes which some people took the trouble to com-
pute beyond a hundred thousand, and one perceives that there is
no order and no rule.
—Euler
Leonhard Euler was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time,
up there with Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss. Like them, he ex-
celled in pure and applied mathematics and created concepts and
methods of enduring significance.
He studied at the University of Basel where the brilliant Johann
Bernoulli was a professor. Euler was allowed to visit him on Saturday
afternoons to quiz him on anything he found puzzling.
Euler published his first mathematical work at age eighteen, the
precocious start of an astonishing output that eventually filled
dozens of volumes, and included acoustics; algebra; artillery and bal-
listics; astronomy, including lunar motion and the calculation of
orbits; calculus, including differential equations and the calculus of
variations; cartography and geodesy; demography; electricity and
magnetism; geometry, including differential geometry; hydraulics
and hydrodynamics; insurance; mechanics; music; navigation and
shipbuilding; number theory; optics; probability; and statistics.
Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783) • 69

He also contributed to what we call recreational mathematics. He
wrote three memoirs on magic squares, and solved the well-known
problem of the Bridges of Königsberg.
Due to a remarkable memory—even in old age he remembered
the whole of Vergil’s Aeneid by heart, page by page—he produced
nearly half of his work after becoming blind after a cataract opera-
tion in 1771. His works were still being published by the St. Peters-
burg Academy nearly fifty years after his death.
Euler was a universal mathematician combining brilliance of calcula-
tion including use of observation and induction with dazzling formal
manipulation and the creation of many novel concepts and methods
that had a lasting impact: for example, he championed the potential
use of divergent series, which do not converge to a finite sum, and
he discovered the famous formula eiπ = −1, which links complex
numbers and the trigonometrical functions.
The theory of numbers was a perfect arena for his genius. If Fer-
mat built the initial foundations of the modern theory of numbers,
Euler extended them and added several stories.
He proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for the case n = 3, and found
many new amicable numbers. He gave new proofs of Fermat’s Little
Theorem and generalized it by introducing Euler’s totient function;
he discovered the law of quadratic reciprocity, though he could not
prove it. He studied the representation of primes in the form ax2 +
by 2, and found a method of primality testing.
Euler extended Fermat’s discoveries on the forms of factors of cer-
tain numbers. He showed that if n = a2m + b2m,  then all its prime fac-
tors are either 2, or of the form 2m + 1k + 1. A special case is that every
prime factor of the Fermat number 225 + 1 must be of the form 64k +
1. Using this fact, he proved that 641 divides F5, and so demolished
Fermat’s conjecture that all the Fermat numbers are prime.
Euler’s convenient numbers
In his search for better ways to prove primality, Euler invented in
1778, when he was already seventy years old and nearly blind, the
idea of a convenient number or numerus idoneus. These are the
numbers such that IF n can be represented in the form x2 + dy 2 in
just one way, with x, y, and d coprime, the n must be prime.
Mersenne and Frenicle de Bessy had both realized that there was a
connection between a number being composite and being repre-
sentable as the sum of two squares in more than one way.
70 • Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783)

For example, Frenicle de Bessy in a letter dated August 2, 1641,
challenged Fermat to factorize 221 by using the fact that 221 = 102 +
112 and 52 + 142.
Euler was the first to develop a specific method. He found a total
of sixty-five convenient numbers, including all the integers 1 to 13,
and expressed his belief that there would be an infinite number of
them, and searched for them up to 10,000, though the largest he
could find was 1848, from which he proved that
18518809 = 1972 + 1848  1002
is prime, a remarkable feat for that time. Even more remarkably, we
now know that Euler’s list of convenient numbers was very likely
complete: there is at most one more to be discovered, and if it exists
it is greater than 1065—a tribute to Euler’s extraordinary powers of
calculation.
Euler found his set of convenient numbers by using the theorem that
m is a convenient number if and only if every integer m + n2 < 4m is
either an odd prime or double an odd prime, or the square of an odd
prime or a power of 2. (Actually, it is now known that this criterion
is necessary but may not be sufficient.)
He gave these figures to show that 13 is a convenient number:
13 + 12 = 14
double an odd prime
13 + 22 = 17
odd prime
13 + 32 = 22
double an odd prime
13 + 42 = 29
odd prime
13 + 52 = 38
double an odd prime
13 + 62 = 49
square of an odd prime
He also claimed many properties for his convenient numbers,
though he did not prove them all, including these true facts:
• The form mx2 + ny2 is convenient if and only if x2 + mny2 is.
• If an integer 4k −1 is convenient, then so is 4(4k −1); and if
3k −1 is convenient, then so is 9(3k −1).
• If n2m is convenient, then so is m.
• The only square convenient numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25.
There is another connection between Euler’s convenient numbers
and a theme that appears repeatedly from Diophantus and Fermat
onward: the idea that a prime is of the form x2 + y 2 if and only if it
is of the form 4n + 1, and similarly for other forms.
Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783) • 71

It turns out that primes of the form x 2 + Ny 2 can be characterized
by a condition such as p = 4n + 1 if and only if N is a convenient
number. (Ore 1948, 61–63) (Frei 1985)
the Basel problem
Euler became immediately famous in 1735 when he solved the Basel
problem, so named because Jacob Bernoulli, writing from Basel, had
begged in one of his books for a solution to a problem that so many
great mathematicians, including Jacob, Johann, and Daniel Bernoulli
and Leibniz and de Moivre had tried and failed to solve. Euler
showed that the sum of the series,
1/12 + 1/22 + 1/32 + 1/42 + 1/52 + . . .
is equal to π 2/6. He also showed that,
1/14 + 1/24 + 1/34 + 1/44 + 1/54 + . . . = π 4/90
and
1/16 + 1/26 + 1/36 + 1/46 + 1/56 + . . . = π 6/945
He later calculated that,
1 + 1/32 + 1/52 + 1/72 + 1/92 + . . . = π2/8
and
1/126 + 1/226 + 1/326 + 1/426 + 1/526 + . . . =
Euler also had the brilliant idea of studying the general series,
1 + 1/2n + 1/3n + 1/4n + 1/5n + 1/7n + 1/8n + 1/9n + . . .
He noticed that this is the product of all these infinite series, one for
each prime:
(1 + 1/2n + 1/22n + 1/23n . . .)(1 + 1/3n + 1/32n + 1/33n . . .)(1 + 1/5n
+ 1/52n + 1/53n . . .)(1 + 1/7n + 1/72n + 1/73n . . .) . . .
Summing each of these geometric series, the sum original sum
equals
. . .
an infinite product of terms, 1/(1 −1/pn), where p ranges over all the
prime numbers from 2 onward.

the integers, to a product involving only the prime numbers! What is

more, both the sum and the product are functions of n that can be
manipulated like any other functions—so here, in this remarkable
transformation, Euler was creating a bridge between the prime num-
bers as discrete integers, and analysis that deals with continuous
quantities, and so taking the theory of prime numbers into entirely
new territory.
Today, mathematicians consider the zeta series:
ζ(s) = 1/1s + 1/2s + 1/3s + 1/4s + 1/5s + . . .
The famous Riemann hypothesis relates to this series, in which the
integer n has become the complex number s.
Euler’s constant
The series 1⁄1 + 1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + . . . + 1⁄n diverges as n tends to infinity. Euler
showed not only that it is approximately log n, but also that
1⁄1 + 1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + . . . + 1⁄n −log n
tends to a constant, Euler’s constant, denoted by the Greek letter
gamma, γ, which he calculated to sixteen decimal places in 1781. It
is approximately 0.577215664901532860 . . . It is not known whether
it is rational. If it is, and γ = a⁄b, then b > 10244662.
This is one of the most mysterious constants in mathematics, which
turns up in some unexpected places. For example: if a large integer
n is divided by each integer k, 1 ≤k ≤n, then the average fraction by
which the quotients fall short of the next integer is not 1⁄2, but γ.
It has been conjectured that if M(n) is the number of primes p ≤n,
such that the Mersenne number 2p −1 is prime, then M(n)/log n
tends to the constant eγ  log 2 = 2.56954 . . . as n tends to infinity.
(Finch 2003, 29)
There are many other series for γ. This is Dr. Vacca’s:
γ = (1⁄2 −1⁄3) + 2(1⁄4 −1⁄5 + 1⁄6 −1⁄7) + 3(1⁄8 −1⁄9 + 1⁄10 −1⁄11 . . . −1⁄15) + . . .
Euler and the reciprocals of the primes
Euler proved in 1737 that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes
1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄5 + 1⁄7 + 1⁄11 + 1⁄13 + 1⁄17 + . . .
diverges. He also claimed, in modern notation, that it diverged like
the function log log n. This is so slow that more than 360,000 terms
are needed for the sum to exceed 3.
Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783) • 73

The alternating sum of the prime reciprocals converges, since its
value always lies between 1⁄2 and 0:
1⁄2 −1⁄3 + 1⁄5 −1⁄7 + 1⁄11 −1⁄13 + . . . = 0.2696063519 . . .
The sum of the squared reciprocals of the primes also converges, to
0.4522474200 . . . (Finch 2003, 95)
Euler’s totient (phi) function
This is is the number of integers less than n and prime to it, denoted
by φ(n). (By convention, φ (1) = 1.) It is therefore also known as the
phi function. Its first few values are:

If p is prime, φ(p) = p −1, and φ( pa) = pa −1( p −1).
Like the two divisor functions, d(n) and σ(n), φ(n) is multiplicative,
meaning that if m and n are coprime, then φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n), so if
we can write n as the product of its prime factors, we can at once
calculate φ(n). In particular, if n is the product of distinct primes p,
q, r, then φ(n) = (p −1)(q −1)(r −1), . . . , for example,
φ(105) = φ(3  5  7) = 2  4  6 = 48
There is a related divisibility property: if a divides b, then φ(a)
divides φ(b).
Apart from φ(1) and φ(2), φ(n) is always even. If n has r distinct odd
prime factors, then 2r divides φ(n).
Not all even numbers, however, are values of φ(n). For example, 
2  7k is never a value. (Schinzel: Ribenboim 1995) On the other
hand, every factorial k! is a value of φ(n). (Gupta: Ribenboim 1995)
Other numbers occur frequently as values of φ(n). The number 12
occurs six times, for n = 13, 21, 26, 28, 36, and 42. The number 16
also occurs six times, and 24 occurs ten times.
The sequence of even non-values of φ(n) starts:
14, 26, 34, 38, 50, 62, 68, 74, 76, 86, 90, 94, 98, 114, 118, . . .
(Sloane A005277)
The sum of φ(d) over every d that divides N, is N. For example, the
divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30, and,
74 • Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783)

φ(1) + φ(2) + φ(3) + φ(5) + φ(6) + φ(10) + φ(15) + φ(30) 
= 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 30
If a number n has many small prime factors, it will have very many
divisors and σ(n) will be relatively large and φ(n) will be relatively
small. So it is not surprising that σ(n)/n and n/φ(n) have the same
order of magnitude, 6/π 2 < σ(n)φ(n)/n2 < 1 if n > 1. (Annapurna 1938) 
The sum φ(1) + φ(2) + φ(3) + φ(4) + . . . + φ(n) is very roughly 3n2/π 2
when n is large.
D. H. Lehmer conjectured that if n is composite, then φ(n) never
divides n −1. No counter-example is known. If it exists it is greater
than 1020 and has more than thirteen prime factors. (Ribenboim 1995,
37) However, φ(n) divides n if and only if the only prime factors of
n are 2 or 3, or both.
If p is prime, then φ(p) = p −1 and σ(p) = p + 1 and so φ(p) + σ(p) =
2p. This is also a sufficient condition: no composite number has this
property. What about the equation φ(n) + σ(n) = 3p? This has solu-
tions, 312, 560, 588, 1400, 85632, . . .
The equation φ(n) + σ(n) = 4p has solutions 23760, 59400, 153720,
and 4563000.
Richard Guy also notes that if n is prime, then φ(n)σ(n) is 1 less than
a perfect square, and this also occurs for n = 6, 22, 33, 44, 69,
76, . . . (Guy 1997)
Carmichael’s totient function conjecture
We have already noted among famous errors that Carmichael con-
jectured that, if φ(n) = k, then there is another number, m, such that
φ(m) = k also, and believed that he had proved this. His proof was
faulty, but the conjecture is now known to be true for all values of
φ(n) up to 101360000.
Erdös did prove that if there is an integer m, for which φ(n) = m
has k solutions, then there are infinitely many integers with the same
property. (Erdös and Dudley 1983)
Harold Donnelly proved that if φ(n) = k does have a unique solution,
then 223272432 divides n. (Donnelly 1973) 
Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783) • 75

It isn’t known whether there are an infinite number of pairs, such as
15 and 16, such that φ(n) = φ(n + 1). However, Sierpinski proved
that there is at least one solution to the equation,
φ(n) = φ(n + k)
for every value of k. The first few solutions are:
k =

It was proved by D. J. Newman that there must be a value of n for
which φ(30n + 1) < φ(30n), but actual tests showed that there is no
such n ≤20,000,000. Then Greg Martin found the smallest n that sat-
isfies the inequality. It is

Once again, the conjecture based on empirical evidence that a solu-

a very long time to appear! (Martin 1999)
curiosities of φ(n)
• 30 is the largest integer with the property that every smaller
integer that is prime to it is itself a prime.
• n −φ(n) is never equal to 10. The sequence of values never
taken by n −φ(n) continues: (10) 26 34 50 52 58 86 100 . . .
• φ(n) ≥n unless n = 2 or n = 6.
• Carl Pomerance noticed that 210 −p is prime for all primes
between 105 and 210. It was proved in 1993 that this is the
only number with this property.

Euler’s quadratic
O’Toole never fully comprehended what exactly was meant by
the expression “quadratic prime.” However he did understand,
and was fascinated by, the fact that the string 41, 43, 47, 53, 61,
71, 83, 97, . . . , where each successive number was computed by
increasing the difference from the previous number by 2, resulted
in exactly forty consecutive prime numbers. The sequence ended
only when the forty-first number in the string turned out to be a
non-prime, namely 41 × 41 = 1681.
—Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee
Euler discovered in 1772 that the formula x 2 −x + 41 is prime for 
x = 1 to 40, and for many values thereafter. Then Legendre noticed
in 1798 that the quadratic x 2 + x + 41 is prime for x = 0 to 39, and
this is, ironically, now known as Euler’s polynomial. In fact it is com-
posite for x = 40, 41, 44, 49, 56, 65, 76, 81, 82, 84, 87, 89, 91, and 96
(Sloane A007634) and prime for all other values up to 100 inclusive.
Of the first 1,000 values, 581 are prime. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
Legendre also noticed that 2x2 + 29 is prime for x = 0, 1, . . . , 28.
In general, the polynomial 2x2 + p, with p = 3, 5, 11, or 29, gives
prime values for x = 0, 1, . . . , p −1.
Euler’s formula was used by Charles Babbage to demonstrate the
capabilities of his Difference Engine. As he explained in a letter to Sir
Humphrey Davy in 1822, the machine could calculate but not print,
Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783) • 77

so an assistant had to write down the numbers as they were pro-
duced:
[The Difference Engine] proceeded to make a table from the formula x 2 +
x + 41. In the earlier numbers my friend, in writing quickly, rather more
than kept pace with the engine; but as soon as four figures were required,
the machine was at least equal in speed to the writer. (Williams and Shallit
1994, 488)
The values x = −40 to −1 produce the same set of prime values. By
substituting x −40 for x in the original formula, we get the quadratic
x2 −79x + 1601, which produces eighty primes in sequence from 
x = 0 to 79, but they are duplicated.
There is a deep reason why the formula n2 + n + 41 gives a prime for
all values of n between 0 and 39, and a simpler reason why we might
expect it to give an unusually large number of primes for any value
of n. Here is the simple reason.
First, n2 + n is even, so we are not surprised that 41 is odd. Simi-
larly, n2 + n  0 or 2 (mod 3), and we notice that 41  2 (mod 3),
so n2 + n + 41  1 or 2 (mod 3). Likewise, n2 + n  0, 1, or 2 (mod
5), and we notice that 41  1 (mod 5), so n2 + n + 41  1, 2, or 3
(mod 5). Continuing with 7, and combining the results, we find that
n2 + n + 41 is never divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. More generally, if x 
11, 17, 41, 101, 137, or 167 (mod 210), then n2 + n + x will never be
divisible by either 2, 3, 5, or 7.

the Lucky Numbers of Euler
It is a theorem that no polynomial, f(n), with integer coefficients can
be a prime for all n or for all sufficiently large n, unless it is a con-
stant. However, some polynomials do produce exceptionally high
proportions of primes.
Prime numbers, p, such as 41, for which the quadratic x2 + x + p
produces many primes have been called by Le Lionnais the Lucky
78 • Euler, Leonhard (1707–1783)

Numbers of Euler. For instance, x 2 −2999x + 2248541 produces
eighty different primes from x = 1460 to 1539. (Beiler 1966, 220)
As a result of computer searches, other forms of quadratics are
known that give more primes. Beeger in 1938 discovered that x 2 +
x + 27941 produces more primes among its first million values, from
x = 0 onwards, than does x 2 + x + 41, 286128 to 261080. Gilbert Fung
discovered,
103n2 −3945n + 34381 for n = 0 to 45
Russell Ruby found: 36x2 −810x + 2753, which is prime for x = 0,
1, . . . , 44.
According to one of the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures, the density of
primes among the values of these quadratic expressions as n tends
to infinity will always be cn/log n, where c will vary with the
expression. Euler’s formula has c = 3.3197732, whereas the formula
n2 + n + 132874279528931 has c = 5.0870883.
Ruby and Fung also found the second record polynomial, 47x 2 −
1701x + 10181, which produces forty-three distinct prime values for
0 ≤x ≤42. (Fung and Williams 1990)
The polynomial 41x2 + 33x −43321 gives prime values for ninety
values of x, 0 ≤x ≤99, but at most twenty-six of these are consecu-
tive.
If one of the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures is true, then the quadratic
x 2 + x + 1712,32986,61656,08771
has a record-breaking asymptotic density, meaning that as x tends to
infinity, it has the largest known proportion of primes among its
values.
Sierpinski has proved that for any integer N, you can find a number
c such that x 2 + c has at least N prime values. It has since been
proved that this holds for any polynomial of degree greater than 1,
with integral coefficients. (Abel and Siebert 1993)

are so large—prior to the age of electronic calculators—that it has been
speculated that Fermat had a secret method of factorization, since lost.
Oliver Sacks describes in his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife
for a Hat, and Other Clinical Tales the twins John and Michael, who,
given a number of up to twenty digits, could say extremely quickly
whether it was prime, though they had difficulty with elementary
arithmetic. (Sacks 1985)

Frank Nelson Cole (1861–1926)
One of the most extraordinary meetings in the history of mathemat-
ics was described by E. T. Bell in Mathematics: Queen and Servant
of Science:
At the October, 1903, meeting in New York of the American Mathematical
Society, Cole had a paper on the programme with the modest title, “On the
Factorization of Large Numbers.” When the chairman called on him for his
paper, Cole—who was always a man of few words—walked to the board
and, saying nothing, proceeded to chalk up the arithmetic for raising 2 to
its 67th power. Then he carefully subtracted 1. Without a word he moved
over to a clear space on the boards and multiplied out, by longhand:
193,707,721 × 761,838,257,287
The two calculations agreed. . . . Cole took his seat without uttering a word.
Nobody asked him a question.
Only later did Cole admit that he had been working on this prob-
lem for the previous twenty years.

The simplest method is the sieve of Erastosthenes, which can be
implemented very efficiently on a computer to find prime factors of
numbers up to several million. In modern factorization methods, the
idea of a sieve has been revived. The best-known algorithm for fac-
toring large numbers is the general number field sieve.
The second method is trial division, which is the natural approach
with a hand calculator. You notice from the last digit and the sum of
digits that the number is not divisible by 2, 5, or 3, and then you start
dividing by 7, 11, 13, 17, . . . Since at least one of the prime factors of
n must be at most n, you need only make a limited number of tri-
als—but that number could be very large. To test 2053, for example,
you need to divide by all the primes up to 2053
 = 45.3 . . .
For a large number, this will take a long time! It would be simpler
if you could know in advance what kind of factors you were look-
ing for, in order to eliminate the rest. This can sometimes be done.
factors of particular forms
Euler proved that if a prime p divides x 2 + y 2 but does not divide
both x and y, then p is the form u2 + v 2. Similarly, if p divides x 2 +
2y2 or x2 + 3y 2, then under the same condition it must be of the forms
u2 + 2v 2 or u2 + 3v 2, respectively.
Fermat discovered that the prime factors of 2p −1 are all of the form
2kp + 1, where k is a positive integer. So to factorize the Mersenne
number 211 −1 = 2047 we need only try the factors 22k + 1 that are
less than 2047
 or roughly 45.
The sequence 22k + 1 starts, 23, 45, 67, 89, . . . As it happens, the
very first works: 2047 ÷ 23 = 89.
Later, Euler proved that any prime factor of a Fermat number, Fn =
22n + 1, if n > 2, is of the form k  2n + 2 + 1.
Since primes of the form 4n + 1 can be written as the sum of two
squares in one way only, and primes of the form 4n + 3 not at all,
you can prove that a number is composite by writing it as a sum of
two squares in at least two ways. Euler proved that 1,000,009 is com-
posite by showing that it could be written as:
1,000,009 = 10002 + 32 = 2352 + 9722
The same fact also allows the factors to be calculated.
84 • factorization, methods of

Conversely, some forms are always composite. Every term of the
sequence of numbers 78557  2n + 1 is divisible by one of the primes
3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, or 73. The number 78557 is probably the smallest
with this property.
Fermat’s algorithm
Fermat also introduced in 1643 another method, the first workable
idea for factorizing large numbers that have no special form. He sug-
gested adding perfect squares to the number, n, to be factored and
testing to see if the result was a perfect square. If it is, then he had
numbers a and b such that,
n + a2 = b2
or
n = b2 −a2 = (b −a)(b + a)

The prime factor 3 appears first at n = 1 (marked in bold) and then
at n = 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . The prime factor 5 appears first at n = 2 (marked
in bold) and then at n = 6, 10, 14, 18, . . . The prime factor 11 appears
at n = 5 and then at intervals of 10, and the prime factor 17 appears
first at n = 4 and then at intervals of 8, which is 1⁄2(17 −1).
If p appears for the first time as a factor of 2n + 1, then p  1 (mod
n). If p | 2n + 1, then p | 2p −1(2n + 1) = 2n + p −1 + 2p −1 = 2n + p −1 + 1 +
(2p −1 −1) and since p | 2p −1 −1 by Fermat’s Little Theorem, p | 2n + p −1
+ 1. Therefore p is a factor at intervals of at most n −1. (McLean 2002,
466–67)

Moreover, this method will find every pair of factors in theory. We
simply calculate half the sum and half the difference of the factors.
For example, 117,983 = 127  929:
1⁄2(127 + 929) = 528
and
1⁄2(929 −127) = 401
and 5282 −4012 = 117,983.
This illustrates, however, the difficulty with this method. You have
to add a lot of squares in sequence to 117,983 before you add 4012.
This method is only really efficient when you are confident that the
factors are pretty equal in size. However, the same basic idea is used
in more modern and sophisticated methods such as the quadratic
sieve and the continued fraction algorithm.
Legendre’s method
Legendre (1752–1833) considered a related idea. Given a number, N,
that he wanted to factor, he took a prime, p, and searched for solu-
tions of the congruence,
x2  p (mod N)
86 • factorization, methods of
Carl Pomerance Recalls
“When I give talks on factoring, I often repeat an incident that hap-
pened to me long ago in high school. I was involved in a math con-
test, and one of the problems was to factor the number 8051. A time
limit of five minutes was given. It is not that we were not allowed to
use pocket calculators; they did not exist in 1960, around when this
event occurred! Well, I was fairly good at arithmetic, and I was sure
I could trial divide up to the square root of 8051 (about 90) in the
time allowed. But on any test, especially a contest, many students try
to get into the mind of the person who made it up. Surely they
would not give a problem where the only reasonable approach was
to try possible divisors frantically until one was found. There must be
a clever alternate route to the answer. So I spent a couple of minutes
looking for the clever way, but grew worried that I was wasting too
much time. I then belatedly started trial division, but I had wasted
too much time, and I missed the problem.
“The trick is to write 8051 as 8100 −49 which is 902 −72, so we may
use algebra, namely, factoring a difference of squares, to factor 8051.
It is 83 times 97.” (Pomerance 1996)

In other words, he checked whether p was a quadratic residue
(mod N ). If it is, then it is also a quadratic residue modulo any prime
factor of N, and this information reduces the number of possible
prime factors that need to be considered. By finding more and more
primes that are quadratic residues of N, more and more possible fac-
tors are eliminated; if he could eliminate all possible factors up to
N
, then he knew that N was prime.
congruences and factorization
Maurice Kraitchik suggested an ingenious variation on Fermat.
Instead of solving n = x2 −y2 you only try to solve the congruence,
x 2 = y2 (mod n)
This means that n divides x2 −y2 = (x −y)(x + y), so that if n divides
neither x + y nor x −y then n must share factors with both x + y or 
x −y.
How do you find likely values of x and y, however? That’s the dif-
ficulty. If there were a simple and quick method of finding x and y,
then factorization would be quick and easy after all, but there isn’t.
So an element of luck comes in and the modern powerful methods
for factorization that are based on Fermat’s original idea all use ran-
dom numbers. The result—ironically—allows large numbers to be
factorized more quickly, and these factorizations, despite the use of
random numbers, are definite: they are quite different from the prob-
abilistic algorithms that are used to tell you with a high probability
that a number is prime (or composite).
how difficult is it to factor large numbers?
Modern methods of factorization depend on advanced mathematical
techniques, such as the elliptic curve method, which can be used to
factor as well as prove primality.
Such powerful methods are necessary, because it takes about twice
as much work to factorize 1000n as it does to factor n, so factorizing
a 100-digit number is far, far harder than factorizing even an 80-digit
number.
In 1970 it was still very difficult to factorize 20-digit numbers that
did not have any especially convenient form, such 2n −1. By 1980,
the Brillhart-Morrison continued fraction algorithm allowed 50-digit
numbers to be factorized easily.
In 1984 the Association for Computing Machinery presented a
plaque to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers on the
factorization, methods of • 87

occasion of the IEEE centennial. It was inscribed with the prime fac-
torization of the number 2251 −1 that was completed that year with
the recently developed quadratic sieve algorithm.
In 1990 Carl Pomerance’s quadratic sieve algorithm had doubled
the length of factorizable numbers up to a record 116 digits, and by
1994 the quadratic sieve had been used to factorize the famous 129-
digit RSA challenge number that Martin Gardner in a 1976 Scientific
American column had judged would be safe for 40 quadrillion years.
In spring 1996, Pollard’s number field sieve became the new cham-
pion, factorizing a 130-digit RSA challenge number in about 15% of
the time required by the quadratic sieve. (Pomerance 1996)
Richard Mollin remarks that there has been a history of seriously
overestimating the difficulty of factorizing integers. The surprising
success of the AKS algorithm for primality testing suggests that per-
haps much more powerful methds of factorization are awaiting dis-
covery. If they aren’t, there is always the possibility of more powerful
machinery in the form of quantum computers.
quantum computation
Testing for primality and factorization of large numbers would be
almost incomparably faster if quantum computation becomes a real-
ity. Instead of calculating on a string of numbers, basically n binary
bits, a quantum computer could operate simultaneously on an n-
dimensional “cube” of 2n binary bits.
88 • factorization, methods of
Maurice Kraitchik (1882–1957)
Maurice Kraitchik was a Russian-born Belgian mathematician who
wrote on the theory of numbers and (like Lucas) on recreational
mathematics, including knight’s tours, rational triangles and the Euler
brick, magic squares, and magic tricks, including that known today
as Total Destiny. Between 1931 and 1939 he edited the journal,
Sphinx: Revue Mensuelle des Questions Récréatives, and he published
The Mathematics of Games and Mathematical Recreations (1943/
1960).
Kraitchik conjectured that if 2n −1 is prime, then (2n + 1)/3 is also
prime, but this fails when n = 89. However, Kraitchik’s conjecture
has been improved to form the New Mersenne conjecture.

The results are theoretically amazing. For example, Shor in 1994 dis-
covered a polynomial time algorithm for factorizing integers, for a
quantum computer. If it could be realized, the RSA cryptosystem and
all similar systems would become useless. According to Adleman a
DNA computer could perform 1020 operations per second, or 100 mil-
lion times faster than a current supercomputer. (Mollin 2001, 267, 269)

Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665)
I have found a very great number of exceedingly beautiful theo-
rems.
—Fermat
Fermat was a lawyer by profession but also something of a classical
scholar, fluent in Greek and Latin as well as Italian and Spanish, and
a poet in Latin.
Fermat and Blaise Pascal founded the modern theory of probabil-
ity, in their correspondence during the summer of 1654. Fermat also
wrote on optics, and Fermat’s principle, that light always follows the
path that takes the shortest time, is named after him.
He developed a method of solving equations of the form x2 −
ay2 = 1, now incorrectly called a Pell equation.
He also performed many integrations and differentiations, though
he never reduced his arguments to a method, and so does not share
with Newton and Leibniz the honor of creating the calculus.
His works were not published during his lifetime because he had
an inexplicable aversion to publication, though he readily sent his
Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665) • 89

results to friends. Explaining one of his discoveries to Mersenne, he
wrote, “I would send you a proof, if I did not fear its being too long.”
When he created his own form of analytic geometry (by 1636), it
wasn’t published, while Descartes published his in 1637, and Fer-
mat’s work in the theory of number was appreciated by almost no
one until Euler rediscovered it.
Fermat was the first modern number theorist. He read Vieta, who
had introduced a new symbolic algebra, and he studied the Arith-
metica of Diophantus. Some of his most important conclusions,
including his statement of Fermat’s Last Theorem, were only pre-
served because his eldest son Samuel published an edition of Dio-
phantus to which he added his Observations on Diophantus based
on his father’s marginal annotations.
Ironically, although he claimed to have a general method that lay
behind his many results, Fermat never revealed it, apart from his one
idea of “infinite descent.” He also claimed to be able to prove what
Diophantus had conjectured, that all positive integers are the sum of
at most four squares. Unlike Diophantus, he only sought for solu-
tions in integers, not fractions, which led him to emphasize prime
numbers and divisibility.
In the absence of learned journals in which to share their results,
mathematicians of that era had a custom of challenging each other to
solve certain problems. In 1640, Frenicle de Bessy challenged Fermat
to find a perfect number of twenty digits “or the next one following
it.” In tackling this problem, which was really about Mersenne
primes, of the form 2p −1, Fermat made three discoveries: that if 
2n −1 is prime, then n is prime also; that if p is an odd prime, then
2p divides 2p −2; and that if p is prime, the prime factors of 2p −1 are
all of the form 2kp + 1, where k is a positive integer. (Williams 1998,
36)
These were extremely significant discoveries. The first typically
shows that if a number involving a power has a certain property, the
index has a property also.
The third shows that we can say something very restricting about
the factors of certain numbers, which at once makes them much eas-
ier to factorize. Fermat used it to show that 223 divides 237 −1.
The second conclusion is the basis for Fermat’s Little Theorem (to
distinguish it from Fermat’s Last Theorem).
90 • Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665)

Fermat’s work eventually had a profound influence. When Euler
discovered Fermat’s results, he was prompted to try to prove many of
them, with brilliant success, and when Augustin-Louis Cauchy’s father,
writing in 1812, wanted to encourage him in his efforts to become
accepted, he wrote, “Your last paper on polyhedra made a deep
impression on the Académie [des Sciences]. If you prove one of Fer-
mat’s theorems, [on polygonal numbers] the way will be wide open
for you. The moment is favourable for you. Do not let it slip by.”
Cauchy didn’t. In 1815 he presented a sensational paper in which
he proved Fermat’s claim in a letter to Mersenne of 1636, that “Every
number is the sum of three cubes, of four squares, and so on, indef-
initely.”
Fermat’s Little Theorem
If p is prime then,
a p  a (mod p)
We can prove this by linking it to the binomial theorem, which says
that (a + 1) p −a p is equal to
a p + pa p −1 + p
a p −2 + . . . + pa + 1 −a p
Since p is prime, all the binomial coefficients are divisible by p, and
this expression is congruent to 1 (mod p).
(a + 1) p −a p  1 (mod p)
and so,
(a + 1) p −(a + 1)  a p −a (mod p)
So the value of (ap −a) does not depend on a, provided p is prime.
So it must be equal to the value of 1p −1 = 0. That is, a p  a (mod
p), which is what we wanted to show.
If p and a are coprime, then we can divide by p and conclude that
a p −1  1 (mod p)
This looks like a promising basis for a primality test—certainly much
better than Wilson’s theorem, because ap −1 is easier to calculate than a
factorial. Unfortunately there is a snag: there are many numbers, p, that
are not prime but that satisfy the equation. These are called pseudo-
primes and it is their existence that makes primality testing so much
harder. To test a number, q, for primality using Fermat’s Little Theorem,
(p −1)

2
Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665) • 91

we can calculate aq −1 for some value of a, divide by q, and see if the
remainder is 1. If it is not, then q is composite. If the equation is satis-
fied, however, then q could still be prime or composite.
What about trying different values of a? Yes, we can do that, and
the chances are that if q is actually composite, sooner or later we will
find a value of a that proves this. Unfortunately—yet again—there is
a snag. Some numbers are composite and yet they satisfy Fermat’s
criterion for every value of a without exception. These are the
Carmichael numbers.
Euler generalized Fermat’s Little Theorem (in 1760), which only
applies to prime numbers. He proved that if n is composite, and if a
and n are coprime, then
aφ(n)  1 (mod n)
Fermat’s Little Theorem implies that if p is prime then p divides 
2p −2. The converse claim, that if n divides 2n −2 then n must be
prime, has been attributed, quite wrongly, to the ancient Chinese,
due to a mistranslation from the Chinese classic The Nine Chapters of
the Mathematical Art.
The German philosopher and mathematician Leibniz, who
invented the calculus at the same time as Newton, did believe the
converse was true, understandably, because the first exception does
not occur until n = 341.

Fermat quotient
By Fermat’s Little Theorem, the quotient (a p −1 −1)/p is an integer if
p is prime and a and p are coprime. It is usually denoted by qp(a) and
behaves a bit like a logarithm:
If p does not divide a or b, then qp(ab) = qp(a) + qp(b)
Fermat and primes of the form x2 + y 2
Fermat also discovered one of the most beautiful and extraordinary
properties in the theory of numbers, which we described in the intro-
duction. It connects the very regular sequence of perfect squares
with the apparently irregular primes.
92 • Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665)

Bachet de Méziriac, whose edition of Diophantus Fermat read and
annotated, had claimed that “almost all” primes of the form 4n + 1
are the sum of two integral squares, and Albert Girard stated that all
primes 4n + 1 have this property. Fermat proved that it was so.
If p is the prime 2 or a prime of the form 4n + 1, greater than 3,
then it is the sum of two integral squares in a unique way. The first
few examples are:
2 = 12 + 12
5 = 12 + 22
13 = 22 + 32
17 = 12 + 42
29 = 22 + 52
37 = 12 + 62
41 = 42 + 52
53 = 22 + 72
It follows that if a number cannot be written as the sum of two inte-
gral squares, or can be so written in more than one way, then it is
not prime.
Euler established in 1738 the condition that an integer is the sum of
two squares: its prime factors of the form 4n + 3 must all occur to an
even power:
12 + 32 = 10 = 2  5
12 + 52 = 26 = 2  13
22 + 42 = 20 = 22  5
32 + 42 = 25 = 52
32 + 52 = 34 = 2  17
32 + 62 = 45 = 32  5
If n is not a prime there is a formula for the number of ways, r(n),
in which it is the sum of two integral squares:
r(n) = 4(d1(n) −d3(n))
where d1(n) is the number of divisors of the form 4n + 1 and d3(n)
is the number of divisors of the form 4n + 3. The function r(n)
counts “trivial” variations, so that 1 = (1)2 + 02 = 02 + (1)2 and 
r(1) = 4.
This implies that d3(n) can never exceed d1(n). If this seems sur-
prising, notice that we are talking about all the divisors of a number,
Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665) • 93

not merely its prime factors. So if our number is 3689 = 7  17  31,
then although 7 and 31 are of the form 4n + 3 and only 17 is a 4n +
1, when we write down all its divisors, they are:
1
7
17
31
119
217
527
3689
and d1(n) = d3(n) because 1 counts as a divisor (though not as a
prime) and the product of 7 and 31 = 217 is of the form 4n + 1.
The remaining primes, which apart from 2 must be of the form 4n +
3, cannot be the sum of two squares.
Fermat correctly claimed that a number is the sum of three squares
unless it is of the form 4n(8n + 7).
He also knew that all primes of the form 8n + 1 or 8n + 3 are of the
form x2 + 2y 2, all primes of the form 3n + 1 can be expressed as 
x2 + 3y 2, and if a number is the product of two primes of the form
20n + 3 or 20n + 7, then it is of the form x 2 + 5y 2. He also noticed
that there were no matching properties for some forms such as
x 2 + 5y 2.
There are other relationships of this kind, of which the simplest is:
any prime p of the form 3n + 1 is also of the form x 2 + xy + y 2. For
example, 7 = 12 + 1  1 + 22; 13 = 12 + 1  3 + 32; 19 = 22 + 2  3 + 32.
Similarly, any prime of the form 6n + 1 can be written as a2 + 3b2,
and every prime of the form 8n + 1 is also of the form x 2 −2y 2. Since
x 2 −2y 2 = (3x + 4y)2 −2(2x + 3y)2, it follows that there is an infinity
of such representations. For example,
17 = 52 −2  22 = 232 −2  162 = 1332 −2  942 = . . .
Fermat’s conjecture, Fermat numbers,

Fermat knew that the first five are all prime, and he famously con-
jectured that they all are: which turned out to be an equally famous
mistake. Euler proved in 1732 that 641 is a factor of F5, using the fact
that he had already proved that any prime factor of Fn, if n > 2, is of
94 • Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665)

the form k  2n + 1 + 1. (Lucas later showed that k must be even, so this
becomes k  2n + 2 + 1.) So all its prime factors are of the form 128k +
1, and the two smallest primes of this form are 257 and 641. As it
happens, 257 = F3 and every pair of Fermat numbers is coprime,
because of this identity:
F0F1F2 . . . Fn −1 + 2 = Fn
Incidentally, this also proves that the number of primes is infinite!
Euler then spotted that 16 = 641 −54 and that 641 −1 = 5 × 27, and
so proved that 641 divides F5:
F5 = 232 + 1 = (16)228 + 1 = (641 −54)228 + 1 = 641m −(5  27)4 +
1 = 641m −(641 −1)4 + 1 = 641m −1 + 1 = 641m
The simplest primality test for Fermat numbers is Pepin’s test. 
It has been conjectured that the number of Fermat primes is finite:
but also that it is infinite.
The famous unresolved cases used to be (2148 + 1)/17 (identified in
1951 by A. Ferrier by using a hand-computing method), and 180 
(2127 −1)2 + 1 (settled in 1951 by Miller and Wheeler). Today all the
Fermat primes up to 2 billion digits are known.
Another unresolved conjecture is that all Fermat numbers are
squarefree. It is known that if Fn has a squared prime factor p2, then
p is a Wieferich prime, meaning that 2p −1  1 (mod p2), and such

To date, 217 Fermat numbers are known to be composite. Wilfrid
Keller keeps an extremely detailed account of Fermat numbers, their
factors, factoring status, newly found factors, and so on, at www

News Flash!
On October 5, 2004, Payam Samidoost discovered this new factor of a Fer-
mat number: 89  2472099 + 1 divides F472097.
Keller’s two previous flashes announced that a new largest known
composite Fermat number had been discovered by John Cosgrave
and his Proth-Gallot Group at St. Patrick’s College (Dublin, Ireland)
on October 10, 2003: 3  22478785 + 1 divides F2478782; and that on
November 1, 2003, Craig Kitchen found another new factor of a Fer-
mat number: 1054057  28300 + 1 divides F8298, bringing to 250 the total
number of then known prime factors.
Generalized Fermat numbers
These are numbers of the form, a2n + b2n. The Generalized Fermat
Prime Search is organized by Phil Carmody using a new and power-
ful test, which enables Generalized Fermat primes to be found as
quickly as Mersenne primes of the same size. If you fancy joining in,
here are some of the records you have to beat!
• Yves Gallot on January 8, 2004 discovered the fifth General-
ized Fermat prime of the form b217 + 1, which is 572186  217,
with 754,652 digits.
• On August 22, 2003, Daniel Heuer discovered the largest
known Generalized Fermat prime: 1176694  217 + 1. This has
795,695 digits and became the fifth largest known prime.
• A month later, on September 22, 2003, Daniel Heuer beat his
own record and found the new largest known Generalized
Fermat prime: 1372930  217 + 1. This has 804,474 digits and is
now the fifth largest known prime.
• The four largest primes found by the Generalized Fermat
Prime Search, all discovered in 2003–4, have more than
600,000 digits.
• The factor 641, which Euler proved divides F5, also divides all
the Generalized Fermat numbers of the form (2a5b)25 + 1,
where one of a and b is odd and the other even. (Yves Gallot;

Fermat’s Last Theorem
I think it’s very important that people are encouraged to work on
very hard problems. The tendency today is to work on short and
immediate problems.
—attributed to Andrew Wiles
Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665) • 97

Fermat had his own copy of the works of Diophantus as translated
by Bachet de Méziriac in 1621. In the margin he wrote, in 1637, orig-
inally in Latin:
To divide a cube into two other cubes, a fourth power or in general any
power whatever into two powers of the same denomination above the sec-
ond is impossible, and I have assuredly found an admirable proof of this,
but the margin is too narrow to contain it.
To which he added, “And perhaps, posterity will thank me for hav-
ing shown it that the ancients did not know everything.” (Burton
1976)
Fermat’s only published proof, in 1659, was of Fermat’s Last Theo-
rem for the case n = 4, in which he used his famous method of infi-
nite descent, showing that if one solution existed, then another,
smaller, solution must also exist, and then a smaller solution
still . . . and so on, reducing the problem to absurdity.
Few believe Fermat had such a proof, and Andrew Wiles found the
first accepted proof in 1994, some 350 years later, but only after eight
years of working secretly, during which he published occasional
minor papers to put colleagues off the scent and allay any suspicions
as to what he was really up to.
Erdös, the great collaborator, not surprisingly objected to Wiles’s
secrecy and claimed that the problem would have been solved
sooner if Wiles had been open: maybe yes, but maybe not by Wiles!
Mathematicians are as competitive as anyone—and Erdös himself
had an unfortunate experience with Atle Selberg over their elemen-
tary proof of the prime number theorem, for which Selberg but not
Erdös won the Fields Medal in 1950. (Hoffman 1998, 183)
98 • Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665)
The philosopher and logician W. V. Quine pointed out that Fermat’s
Last Theorem is equivalent to this claim about sorting objects into
bins:
Suppose that there are z bins in total, and that x bins are not
painted red, and y bins are not painted blue. The remaining bins are
uncolored. You have n objects to sort into the bins.
Then Fermat’s Last Theorem is equivalent to the statement that:
“The number of ways of sorting them that shun both colors is equal
to the number of ways that shun neither.” (Quine 1988)

the first case of Fermat’s Last Theorem
Prime numbers have appeared more than once in attempts to settle
Fermat’s Last Theorem, by Kummer, Sophie Germain, and Wieferich.
The first case is when x, y, z, and p are coprime. The second case
is when p divides at least one of x, y, and z. The distinction was first
made by Sophie Germain in 1832, who proved that for a prime p, 
x p + y p = z p has no solution if 2p + 1 is also prime.
Another test for the first case, by Mirimanoff in 1910, says that in
the first case, if there are solutions, then m p −1  1 (mod p 2) is true
for m = 2 and m = 3. No such primes are known.
Ernst Eduard Kummer realized in 1843 that current attempts to prove
Fermat’s Last Theorem did not work because Gaussian integers might
be factorized in several different ways: their factorization was not
unique. So he invented ideal numbers, one of the many develop-
ments in mathematics that have been prompted by attempts to solve
FLT.
Kummer proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for all regular primes,
where an irregular prime is an odd prime p that divides the numer-
ator of one of the Bernoulli numbers B2n with 2n + 1 < p. The first
irregular prime to appear in the sequence of numerators is 691 at
B12.
Kummer proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for all odd prime expo-
nents less than 165, except for these eight irregular primes: 37, 59,
67, 101, 103, 131, 149, and 157.
The sequence of regular primes starts, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,
31, 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, . . . but it is not known if
there is an infinity of them.
The proportion of regular primes among the primes less than 106 is
47627/78497 = 0.6067 . . . which fits the conjecture that the density
tends to e−1/2 = 0.6065 . . . (e is the base of natural logarithm).
Jensen proved in 1915 that there is an infinity of irregular primes, and
all the irregular primes up to 12,000,000 have now been calculated.
Wall-Sun-Sun primes
D. D. Wall, Z. H. Sun, and Z. W. Sun proved in 1992 that if the first case
of Fermat’s Last Theorem is false for p, then p2 divides ( p −( p|5))th
Fibonacci number, where p|5 is the Legendre symbol used to express
Fermat, Pierre de (1607–1665) • 99

the law of quadratic reciprocity. (This notation is nothing to do with
p|5 meaning “p divides 5 exactly”!)
We now know that Fermat’s Last Theorem is never false, but it still
remains an unknown question whether any Wall-Sun-Sun primes
exist.

Catalan equation and conjecture; pseudoprimes; Sophie Germain

Fermat-Catalan equation and conjecture
Catalan’s conjecture and Fermat’s Last Theorem are both special
cases of the Fermat-Catalan equation:
x p + y q = z r
Here x, y, and z are positive, coprime integers and the exponents are
all primes with 1/p + 1/q + 1/r ≤1.
The Fermat-Catalan conjecture is that there are only finitely many
solutions to this system. These solutions include:
1 + 23
= 32
173 + 27 = 712
72 + 25
= 34
114 + 35 = 1222
132 + 73 = 29
More recently, F. Beukers and D. Zagier have found these solutions,
making a total of ten known solutions:
15490342 + 338
= 156133
22134592 + 14143 = 657
153122832 + 92623 = 1137

= 210639282

Fibonacci numbers
Leonardo Pisano (c. 1175–1250), nicknamed Fibonacci, in his Liber
Abaci brought the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to Western Europe
in 1202. He also listed the primes from 10 to 100 and pointed out that
to check whether a number was prime you only needed to divide it
by the primes less than its square root. He also included problems
similar to Diophantus, such as how to find a square that remains a
square when 5 is added or subtracted. His answer, in fractions, is,
(41/12)2 + 5 = (49/12)2
(41/12)2 −5 = (31/12)2
Fibonacci is now remembered for this problem:
A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded on all sides by a
wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year
if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a new pair which from
the second month on becomes productive?
Assuming that the rabbits are immortal, this is the number of new
pairs each month:
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89 . . .
Each term is the sum of the previous two terms.
This extraordinary sequence has so many properties that there is a jour-
nal, The Fibonacci Quarterly, devoted entirely to it. For example, the
ratio of successive terms, Fn + 1/Fn tends to the Golden Ratio, 1.618 . . .
To date, Fn* is known to be prime for n = 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29,
43, 47, 83, 131, 137, 359, 431, 433, 449, 509, 569, 571, 2971, 4723, 5387,
9311, 9677, 14431, 25561, 30757, 35999, and 81839. All values of n up
to 100,000 have been tested by Harvey Dubner and Wilfrid Keller.
It isn’t known if there are an infinite number of Fibonacci primes.
However, it is known that consecutive pairs are coprime, because of
the identity,
F 2
n + 1 = FnFn + 2 + (−1)n
Fibonacci numbers • 101
*For simplicity and memorability, we are using Fn for both the nth Fermat number and the nth
Fibonacci number. This should not cause confusion as they never seem to occur together!

There are many other formulae connecting the Fibonacci numbers,
such as:
F 2
n + F 2
n + 1 = F2n + 1
F 2
n = Fn −1Fn + 1 −(−1)n
provided n > 1
F 2
n = Fn −2Fn + 2 + (−1)n
provided n > 2
F 2
n = Fn −3Fn + 3 −22(−1)n
provided n > 3
F 2
n = Fn −4Fn + 4 + 32(−1)n
provided n > 4
F 2
n = Fn −5Fn + 5 −52(−1)n
provided n > 5
and so on. The coefficients of (−1)n are the Fibonacci squares.
These formulae show that F2n is never adjacent to a prime, except
possibly when n = 3.
F2n + (−1)n = Fn −1(Fn + 2 + Fn)
F2n −(−1)n = Fn + 1(Fn + Fn −2)
There are similar formulae for F2n + 1.
Vernon Hoggatt Jr. and Marjorie Bicknell-Johnson proved much
more: the smaller neighbor of every power of a Fibonacci number is
composite, with the exception of F3
2 = 4.
The larger neighbors of all powers of Fn are also composite, unless
the power itself is a power of 2 and n is a multiple of 3, in which
case it may be prime. For example, F9
4 + 1 = 1336337 and F15
8 + 1 are
both prime. (Hoggatt and Bicknell-Johnson 1977)
divisibility properties
A basic fact is that Fn divides Fmn, so if Fq is prime, then q must be
prime, with the sole exception of q = 4, since F2 = 1. However, this
is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Thus F19 = 4181 = 37  113,
and F37 = 73  149  2221.
The greatest common divisor of two Fibonacci numbers, Fn and Fm,
is always another Fibonacci number whose index is the greatest
common divisor of n and m.
A related theorem is that if and only if n | m then Fn | Fm, so you can
study the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers by studying their
index numbers, and draw conclusions such as:
102 • Fibonacci numbers

2 | Fn if and only if 3 | n
3 | Fn if and only if 4 | n
5 | Fn if and only if 5 | n
and so on . . .
We can also prove that there is at least one Fibonacci number divis-
ible by any given number n: in fact, it can be found among the first
n2 numbers in the sequence. It then follows that there are an infinity
of such numbers. In particular, for every prime number, p, there is a
Fibonacci term that is divisible by p, and it occurs among the first 
p + 1 terms.
Choose n + 1 Fibonacci numbers from the set F1, F2, F3, . . . , F2n: then
one of the chosen numbers divides another, exactly. (Weinstein
1966)
If p is a prime greater than 7 and p  2 (mod 5) or p  4 (mod 5)
and 2p −1 is also prime (a condition reminiscent of the Sophie Ger-
main prime condition), then (2p −1) | Fp, which is therefore com-
posite.
Mihàly Bencze proved an elegant divisibility property for what might
be called a very generalized Fibonacci sequence. In the sequence,
the first four values are given, and the rule then is that 
B(n + 4) = B(n + 1) + B(n):
n

B(n) is always divisible by n, when n is prime. (Bencze 1998)
If p is prime, then Fp may be prime or composite, but if it is com-
posite, then its factors will never have appeared earlier in the
Fibonacci sequence as factors of any term.
Fibonacci curiosities
• The largest known Fibonacci prime is F81839.
• For every n, it is possible to find n consecutive composite
Fibonacci numbers. For n ≥4, Fn + 1 is always composite.
Fibonacci numbers • 103

• Every positive can be written as a sum of distinct Fibonacci
numbers.
• The prime number 17 is the only prime that is the average of
two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. (Honaker: Caldwell,
Prime Pages)
• If p is prime, then Fp
n is square-free, unless p = 5, in which
case F5
n = 5nm where m is square-free.
• F1, F2, F6 = 8 and F12 = 144 are the only Fibonacci numbers that
are powers.
• If Fn is prime, then n is prime also, but the converse is occa-
sionally false. The smallest counterexample is F19 = 4181 =
37  113.
• The only Fibonacci perfect cubes are 1 and 8.
• The only numbers that are simultaneously Fibonacci and
Lucas are 1 and 3.
• A. W. F. Edwards defined an infinite coprime sequence as one
in which any pair of terms are coprime. A simple set of such
sequences is given by: un = u2
n −1 −un −1 + 1, for u1 > 1. For
example, if u1 = 2, the sequence starts 1, 3, 7, 43, 1807,
3263443, . . . (Edwards 1964)
• Mersenne numbers satisfy a Fibonacci-like equation: Mn + 1 =
3Mn −2Mn −1
Édouard Lucas and the Fibonacci numbers
Lucas factorized all the first sixty Fibonacci numbers, and first noted
that if n | m, then Fn | Fm. He then observed a remarkable fact about
their primitive factors, meaning those factors that divide Fn but do
not divide any smaller Fibonacci number. A primitive factor of Fn is
congruent to 1 (mod n), with the exception n = 5.

Based on such observations—he had no proof, Carmichael proved
the result much later in 1913—Lucas proposed as a theorem that:
If n  3 (mod 10) and n is a primitive divisor of F(n + 1), then n
is prime. If n  1 (mod 10) and n is a primitive divisor of F(n −1),
then n is prime.
On the basis of this theorem, and with an estimated 170 to 300 hours
of work, Lucas drew a remarkable conclusion: that the enormous
number 2127 −1 is prime. As Lucas observed, his theorem “allows us
to determine whether a number is prime or composite without mak-
ing use of a table of prime numbers,” and so he inaugurated the
modern era of primality testing.
See also Fibonacci composite sequences
Fibonacci composite sequences
Although it’s not known if there is an infinity of Fibonacci primes,
there are generalized Fibonacci sequences in which each term is the
sum of the previous two terms, which contain no prime numbers:
every term is composite.
In 1964 R. L. Graham believed he had constructed an example of
such a sequence, for which:
G(1) = 1786 77270 19288 02632 26871 51304 55793
G(2) = 1059 68322 50539 15111 05816 51416 86995
The sequence then continues with G(3) = G(1) + G(2), and so on.
But he made a mistake that was corrected by Donald Knuth (1990),
who gave these correct starting numbers:
Fibonacci numbers • 105

G(1) = 331 63563 59982 74737 47220 06564 30763
G(2) = 1510 02891 10884 01971 18959 03054 98785
Knuth then produced his own smaller starting pair:
G(1) = 49 46343 57432 05655
G(2) = 62 63828 00042 39857
(Graham 1964) (Knuth 1990)
formulae for primes
A formula, a magic rule, for producing primes! How delightful!
Unfortunately, no simple and useful formula exists, though no one
has ever proved that a formula is impossible. We do, however, have
some good tries, some of them merely amusing, some of them amaz-
ing, and some of them deep.
The term “formula” itself is ambiguous. It could mean a formula
that produces all the primes pn in order, as a function of n. So you
simply apply the formula to find the nth prime. An exact formula for
π(n) would be effectively as good.
A much weaker demand is that the formula produces only prime
numbers, never composite. This is what Fermat thought, mistakenly,
of his Fermat numbers, and many other conjectures that a certain for-
mula produced only primes have also been shot down, though there
are many formulae that produce primes for a while and then fail,
illustrating Richard Guy’s strong law of small numbers.
Conversely, the expression n6 + 1091 is composite for n = 1 to 3905
(Shanks), and 22n −5 −2a is composite for all n > 2 and a > 2.
(Crocker 1961)
An even weaker interpretation is a function that produces sur-
prisingly many primes. The linear polynomial 30n −13 produces
411 primes among the first 1,000 values of n. (Caldwell, Prime
Pages) Better-known examples are Euler’s prime polynomial and its
relatives.
The very word “formula” is also unclear. In Hollywood movies, any
mathematical formula, stolen by a fiendish spy or created by a mad
professor, is likely to be a polynomial, with maybe a few square root
signs or integrals thrown in. We can allow more functions than this:
for example, factorial, subfactorial, the integral part of a non-integer,
and many others.
106 • formulae for primes

Conway’s prime-producing machine is extraordinarily impressive at
first glance, but it turns out to be a cunningly disguised sieve.
No polynomial can produce only primes, but in solving Hilbert’s
10th problem, Matijasevic showed that there are polynomials in
many variables whose positive values are the prime numbers—
though most of their values are negative and usually not prime.
If y  x (mod n) is an allowable function, this function generates all
the primes, if n is any non-negative integer:
f(n)  2 + (2(n!) mod (n + 1))
If n + 1 is prime, then by Wilson’s theorem
n!  −1 (mod n + 1)
and so
2(n!)  −2 (mod n + 1)
and so
f(n) = n + 1.
But if n + 1 is prime, then its prime factors will be less than n and so
2(n!)  0 (mod n + 1), and f(n) = 2.
C. P. Willans established a formula to test whether any number, x, is
prime. It is
f(x, y) = 1⁄2(y −1)⎣|B2(x,y) −1| −(B2(x, y) −1)⎦+ 2
where B(x,y) = x(y + 1) −(y! + 1) and ⎣x⎦is the floor function, equal
to the greatest integer ≤x.
This function also generates each odd primes once, and otherwise
equals 2. (Honsberger 1976, 33) For example,
F(1,2)
= 3
F(5,4)
= 5
F(103,6) = 7
No other prime is generated for values of x, y less than 1000.
Willans then used this function to derive a complex and typically
useless formula for the nth prime number. (Willans 1964, 413–15)
Here is another trick: define the number s to be the decimal in which
each prime p is followed by p zeros:
s = 0.200300050000070000000110000000000013 . . .
Then the formula

pn = ⎣10n2s⎦−102n −1⎣10 exp (n −1)2s⎦
recovers them, but tells you nothing you didn’t already know unless
there were a means of calculating s independently, which no one
expects.
G. H. Hardy managed to find an exact formula for ϑ(x), the largest
prime factor of a number x. Without making the slightest attempt to
explain it, here it is!

The lengths some people will go to produce prime numbers! Reo
Fortune, who was an anthropologist and once married to Margaret
Mead, thought up this one and conjectured, naturally, that all the
Fortunate numbers are prime.
The sequence goes: 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 17, 19, 23, 37, 61, 67, 61, 71, 47,
107, 59, 61, 109, 89, 103, 79, 151, 197, 101, 103, 233, 223, 127, 223,
191, 163, 229, 643, . . .
The conjecture may well be true, since the nth Fortunate number
is not divisible by any of the first n primes, and yet is relatively small.
Thus the fourth Fortunate number is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, and
is only 13, so it must be prime (even if we didn’t know that already!).
Indeed, we could replace “the next prime” by “the next prime-but-
one” and still expect to get primes:

The conjecture could only fail if there is a sufficiently large gap
between two primes, so that “the next prime,” on at least one occa-
sion, is very large indeed, and this is thought unlikely. (Golomb
1981)
gaps between primes and composite runs
The gap g(n) between the primes p(n) and p(n + 1) is usually
defined to be the number of composite numbers between them, so
g(n) is 1 less than the difference.
Since the primes slowly become scarcer and scarcer, g(n) must
increase on average. In fact, we can find gaps eventually as large as
we please. However, there are an infinite number of n for which 
g(n + 1) < g(n).
We say that g(n) is a maximal gap if g(m) < g(n) for all m < n. A
maximal gap is a record-breaking gap, the first occurence of a gap
that large, up to that point.
The sequence of maximal gaps starts with n = 1, 2, 4, 9, 24, 30, 99,
154, 189, 217, 1183, 1831, 2225, 3385, 14357, 30802, . . .
Cramér’s conjecture is that the largest gap between primes round
about n is always less than (log n)2. If Cramér’s conjecture is true,
then so is Fortune’s conjecture, at least for large values of n.
If n > 48, then there is a prime between n and 9n/8, inclusive.
If n > 117, then the interval n to 4n/3 inclusive contains a prime
number of each of the forms 4n + 1, 4n + 3, 6n + 1, and 6n + 5.
These theorems require difficult proofs. In contrast, computers have
been used to discover many curious statistics, such as:
• Among the first six million primes (up to 104,395,289), the
largest difference between consecutive primes is 220, and the 
gaps between primes and composite runs • 109

smallest difference that does not appear in this range is 186.
(Gruenberger and Armerding)
• The first pair of consecutive primes differing by 100 are
396,733 and 396,833.
• The first gap of at least 1,000 is the surprisingly large gap of
1,132 following the prime 1693182318746371, discovered by
Thomas Nicely and Bertil Nyman.
• Harvey Dubner has found a gap of at least 50,206 near 3 

Gauss, Johann Carl Friedrich (1777–1855)
Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is
the queen of mathematics.
—Gauss
Gauss was a genius who contributed to almost all fields of pure and
applied mathematics, especially calculus, geometry, algebra, proba-
bility, geodesy, and of course number theory, as well as—like New-
ton—astronomy and optics.
As a child he was a calculating prodigy, but unlike most prodigies
he retained this useful ability all his life. It contributed to the pattern
of his work, which combined extensive empirical investigations with
deep insight and an emphasis on proof, not merely to confirm what
he was already convinced was true, but as a source of illumination.
He published six proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity (a sev-
enth was found among his papers), each one adding to his—and
other mathematicians’—understanding of this deep problem.
He showed at the age of nineteen that a regular n-sided polygon
can be constructed with a ruler and compasses if and only if n is the
product of a power of 2 and one or more distinct Fermat primes. Just
as Euclid had ended his Elements with the construction of the do
decahedron and icosahedron, Gauss ended his early masterpiece,
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801 when he was twenty-
four, with the solution to this problem and a list of possible numbers
of sides up to the limit of 300.
In the same year he used novel methods to predict the position of
the minor planet Ceres, which had been “lost,” a sensational result
110 • Gauss, Johann Carl Friedrich (1777–1855)

after which he was famous as both a mathematician and an as-
tronomer.
Gauss also proved that every number is the sum of three triangular
numbers, a conclusion that Fermat had drawn but could not prove.
Gauss reduced it to the problem of representing a number as the
sum of three squares by pointing out that if,
M = 1⁄2x(x + 1) + 1⁄2y(y + 1) + 1⁄2z(z + 1)
Then
8M + 3 = (2x + 1)2 + (2y + 1)2 + (2z + 1)2
He then proved another of Fermat’s claims, that any integer is the
sum of at most four squares.
He refused to spend time on Fermat’s Last Theorem, replying to the
astronomer Olber’s urging by saying, “I confess that Fermat’s Theo-
rem as an isolated proposition has very little interest for me, because
I could easily lay down a multitude of such propositions, which one
could neither prove nor dispose of.” (Newman 1956)
Gauss and the distribution of primes
Gauss, in a letter to Encke on Christmas Eve 1849, wrote, “As a boy
I considered the problem of how many primes there are up to a
given point. From my computations, I determined that the density of
primes around x, is about 1/log(x).” He claimed to have made many
of his discoveries “through systematic, palpable experimentation.”
(Mackay 1994)
Given a few minutes’ spare time he would calculate prime num-
bers. He is supposed during his lifetime to have calculated all the
primes up to 3,000,000. However, he also employed another calcu-
lating prodigy, Zacharias Dase (1824–1861), who was no mathemati-
cian, to do calculations for him. Like many calculating prodigies,
Dase toured widely giving exhibitions of his abilities. He calculated
seven-figure tables of logarithms and the value of π to two hundred
places, and made a factor table of the numbers between 7 and 10
million.
Gauss later conjectured on the basis of empirical evidence that π(x),
the number of primes less than x, is approximately equal to
Li(x) = 
x
2
and that the number of primes up to n is about n/(log n).

Gaussian primes
Gaussian integers are of the form a + bi where i = −1
. Like the nat-
ural numbers, Gaussian integers can be uniquely factorized. How-
ever, certain ordinary primes are composite when regarded as
Gaussian integers with b = 0.
In fact, since all ordinary primes of the form 4n + 1 can be
expressed as the sum of two squares, such as
13 = 22 + 32
they are Gaussian composites, because
22 + 32 = (2 −3i)(2 + 3i)
A Gaussian prime a + bi fits these conditions: if a and b are non-zero,
then a + bi is a Gaussian prime if and only if a2 + b2 is an ordinary
prime. If either a or b = 0, then the absolute value of the other must
be an ordinary prime of the form 4n + 3.
One measure of the “size” of a Gaussian integer, a + bi, is its norm,
a2 + b
2. The sequence of Gaussian primes in the first quarter of the
Argand diagram starting with the smallest norm is: 1 + i, 2 + i, 3, 3 +
2i, 4 + i, 5 + 2i, 7 + i, 5 + 4i, 7, 7 + 2i, 6 + 5i, 8 + 3i, 8 + 5i, 9 + 4i, . . .
If a + bi is a Gaussian prime, then so are a −bi, −a + bi, and −a −
bi, so the Gaussian primes are symmetrical about the origin when
they are plotted on an Argand diagram. This is the pattern they
make, for all a and b such that a2 + b
2 < 1000, meaning that they
lie within a circle with radius 1010
.
This pattern has been used for tablecloths and tiling floors, as well
as prompting questions such as: if the Gaussian primes are “step-
ping-stones” to infinity, what is the largest step you ever need to
take? It is known that you need to cross gaps of at least 5. (Gethner,
Wagon, and Wick 1998)
112 • Gauss, Johann Carl Friedrich (1777–1855)

Gauss’s circle problem
How many points are there on or inside a circle whose center is a lat-
tice point? If the radius is R, then the total is,
r(0) + r(1) + r(2) + r(3) . . . + r(R2)
where r(N ) is the formula for the number of ways in which N is the sum
of two integral squares. (See Fermat and primes of the form x 2 + y 2.)
The points on a square lattice that are visible from the origin are
just the points whose coordinates are coprime: so their density is
equal to the probability that two integers chosen at random are
coprime, which is 6/π 2.

The pattern is pretty much irregular, except for the left-hand edge,
which after the initial 2 seems to always be 1. Proth first noticed this
pattern in 1878 and claimed, mistakenly, to have proved it. Later
Gilbreath spotted it when he was a student at the University of Cali-
fornia at Los Angeles in the late 1950s, and it is now called Gil-
breath’s conjecture. It has been verified for primes less than 1013.
(Odlyzko 1993)
One ingenious suggestion is that this property has nothing spe-
cifically to do with primes at all, but is true of any starting se-
quence that begins with 2 and continues with odd numbers that
increase fairly slowly and don’t have too great gaps. Here is an
example, in which the initial row is a mixture of primes and com-

GIMPS—Great Internet 
Mersenne Prime Search
GIMPS is the best-known example of distributed computing. In 1995
George Woltman collated all the known results on Mersenne primes
and in January 1996 put them on the Web, together with a fast pro-
gram for testing whether a Mersenne number is prime. Soon scores
of experts and thousands of amateur enthusiasts were joining the
hunt, including schoolteachers who have used the GIMPS phenome-
non to motivate their students, who can run the free software them-
selves as a class project.
Today, the GIMPS uses Entropia’s PrimeNet system, which per-
forms 2 trillion calculations per second, every second, all day, while
its tame computers are doing other tasks, even while their owners
are asleep—nothing stops it!
The results are incredible: GIMPS spent thirteen thousand years of
computer time to find the then record-breaking prime 213,466,917 −1,
discovered by Michael Cameron in 2001.
One GIMPS enthusiast, Nayan Hajratwala of Plymouth, Michigan,
won $50,000 in 1999, one of the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s
cooperative computing awards, for discovering the first million-digit
prime, 26,972,593 −1, which has 2,098,960 digits.
If you want to join the fun, more information and the free software
are available at www.mersenne.org/prime. The state of play is re-
corded on the GIMPS status page, at www.mersenne.org/status.
All the Mersenne numbers less than 101,000,000 have been tested at
least once, most of them more than once. Both of the largest known
primes were found by GIMPS members. On December 11, 2003,
CNN headlined, “Student finds largest known prime number.” A
GIMPS member, Michael Shafer, a graduate student at Michigan State
University, had found the latest world record prime on his Dell com-
puter, one of more than two hundred thousand computers involved
in the search, making between them 9 trillion calculations per sec-
ond. It is 220,996,011 −1, is 6,320,430 digits long, and would take hun-
dreds of pages to print out.

Giuga’s conjecture
According to Fermat’s Little Theorem, if p is prime then each of the
p −1 terms on the left-hand side is equal to 1 (mod p), so their sum
equals −1 (mod p):
Sp = 1p −1 + 2 p −1 + 3 p −1 + . . . + ( p −1) p −1  −1 (mod p)
Giuga conjectured in 1950 that if this congruence is true, p must be
prime.
He also proved that Sn  −1 (mod n) if and only if for each prime
divisor p of n, both p −1 and p divide n/p −1, so if a counterexam-
ple exists it would be a special type of Carmichael number, which
looks like a very limiting condition. Indeed, if an exception to
Giuga’s conjecture exists, it has at least 12,000 digits. This conjecture
has been verified for p ≤101700. (Ribenboim 1996)
Giuga numbers
If n is a composite number such that p | n/p −1 for all prime divi-
sors, p, of n, then n is a Giuga number. Giuga proved that n is a
Giuga number if and only if the sum of the reciprocals of its prime
divisors, less their product, is an integer. For example, the smallest
Giuga number is 30 and,
1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄5 −1⁄30 = 1
The sequence of Giuga numbers continues 858 = 2  3  11  13

Goldbach’s conjecture
The famous problem of which I propose to speak tonight is prob-
ably as difficult as any of the unsolved problems of mathematics.
—G. H. Hardy on Goldbach’s conjecture
Christian Goldbach (1690–1764) was born in Königsberg in Prussia
but spent most of his life in Russia where he was appointed corre-
spondence secretary of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St.
Petersburg. His social success interfered with his mathematical work
but he corresponded with many of the leading mathematicians of
Europe, and for more than thirty years with Euler, whom he
prompted to investigate the fifth Fermat number, 225 + 1, which Euler
proved was composite.
On June 7, 1742, Goldbach wrote a letter to Euler in which he
speculated on how numbers might be represented as the sum of
primes. In particular, he suggested that every number is the sum of
three primes.
Goldbach’s conjecture means today the strong claim that any even
number (2 excepted) is the sum of two primes: it has never been
proved.
The weaker conjecture, that every odd number can be written as a
sum of three primes, is known to be true if another conjecture
related to the Riemann hypothesis is true. It is true anyway for all but
a finite but very large number of possible exceptions, all less than
1043000.
The main conjecture remains extremely difficult, so the publishers
Faber and Faber must have felt pretty safe when they announced as
an advertising gimmick to promote their book Uncle Petros and
Goldbach’s Conjecture by Apostolos Doxiadis that they were offering
£1 million to anyone who could prove Goldbach’s conjecture
between March 20, 2000, and March 20, 2002. They were right—the
prize was not claimed.
Ironically, Goldbach himself would not have been allowed to
enter—Item 10 of the Terms and Conditions restricted the challenge
to “legal residents of the United Kingdom and the United States aged
18 or over”!
Goldbach’s conjecture • 117

Although Goldbach’s conjecture has not been proved, it is clear (!)
that all even numbers but the smallest are the sum of two primes in
an increasing number of ways:
14 = 3 + 11 = 7 + 7
16 = 3 + 13 = 5 + 11
18 = 5 + 13 = 7 + 11
20 = 3 + 17 = 7 + 13
22 = 3 + 19 = 5 + 17 = 11 + 11
24 = 5 + 19 = 7 + 17 = 11 + 13
26 = 3 + 23 = 7 + 19 = 13 + 13
28 = 5 + 23 = 11 + 17
. . .
The sequence of the smallest even numbers that are the sum of
two primes in n ways starts: 6, 10, 22, 34, 48, 60, . . .
Goldbach’s conjecture was verified in 1998 by Joerg Richstein up to
4  1014. The conjecture that every odd number is the sum of three
primes has been checked up to 1020. It is equivalent to the statement
that every integer greater than 17 is the sum of three distinct primes.
It is known that every integer is the sum of at most six primes, and that
all sufficiently large numbers are the sum of a prime and a semiprime.
Also, every number n greater than 161 is the sum of distinct primes
of the form 6n −1; if n > 205, of distinct primes, 6n + 1; if n > 55, of dis-
tinct primes of the form 4n + 3; and if n > 121, distinct primes, 4n + 1.
If N is even and large enough, then there is a number n, less than N,
such that n(N −n) has at most five prime factors. (Halberstam and
Richert 1974)
Many even numbers can simply be written as the sum of 3, 5, or 7
and another prime. The smallest that cannot is 98 = 19 + 79.
Goldbach also conjectured in a letter to Euler of 1752 that every odd
integer is the sum of a prime (which for Goldbach included the
number 1) and double a square. Moritz Stern discovered in 1856 that
5777 and 5993 are exceptions.
Laurent Hodges has checked up to 1,000,000 and found no more
exceptions, so there probably are none, for, as Euler pointed out, the
number of representations in the form N = p + 2a2 increases with N.
118 • Goldbach’s conjecture

Hodges calculates, for example, that there are just twenty-eight num-
bers from 17 to 6797 that can be represented in only one way as p +
2a2. (Hodges 1993)
Dan Zwillinger checked which even numbers from 2 to 1,000,000
can be written as the sum of twin primes, that is, primes that are each
a member of a pair of twin primes. Only thirty-three exceptions were
found, all less than 5000. The smallest three exceptions were 94, 96,

way is 24098. (Zwillinger 1979)

Grimm’s problem
Grimm conjectured that given any sequence of consecutive numbers,
there is a matching sequence of distinct primes among their factors.
For example:

1810

It has been proved that there are only finitely many exceptions to the
conjecture. (Grimm 1969)
Hardy, G. H. (1877–1947)
The mathematician’s patterns, like the painter’s or the poet’s,
must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colors or the words must fit
together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no
permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.
—G. H. Hardy
Hardy, G. H. (1877–1947) • 119

Hardy was the greatest British mathematician of the twentieth cen-
tury, and a brilliant exponent of very pure mathematics, especially
prime numbers. In his book A Mathematician’s Apology he put into
words what so many mathematicians feel—“I am interested in math-
ematics only as a creative art”—and he expressed his satisfaction that
nothing he had ever discovered or proved would have any practical
use whatsoever: so he might have been disappointed to learn that
the factorization of giant prime numbers is today important in public
key encryption.
In an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Sci-
ence he said, “A science is said to be useful if its development tends
to accentuate the existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth, or
more directly promotes the destruction of human life,” adding that
the study of prime numbers did neither, while “the greatest mathe-
maticians of all ages have found in it a mysterious attraction impos-
sible to resist.” (Hardy 1915, 14)
In his inaugural lecture as professor at Oxford University, he said,
“If I could attain every scientific ambition of my life, the frontiers of
the Empire would not be advanced, not even a black man would be
blown to pieces, no one’s fortune would be made, and least of all my
own. A pure mathematician must leave to happier colleagues the
great task of alleviating the sufferings of humanity.” (Hardy 1920)
Hardy once sent a postcard to a friend listing his six New Year
wishes. One was to make 211 not out in the fourth innings of the last
test match at the Oval. (Hardy was a cricket fanatic.) Another was to
murder Mussolini, but the first was to prove the Riemann hypothesis.
Hardy’s life was marked by two remarkable collaborations. The
first started in 1911 when he began to work with J. E. Littlewood,
who was eight years his junior. They worked together for thirty-five
years writing nearly one hundred papers, many on number theory,
including the Riemann zeta function.
Two years later, Hardy received a letter from Ramanujan, contain-
ing a large number of results, some well-known, some merely novel,
and some, Hardy argued, so extraordinary that they could only be
the work of a mathematician of genius.
He recorded this famous anecdote describing a visit to Ramanujan
while he was ill:
I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number
seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable
omen. “No,” he replied, “it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest
120 • Hardy, G. H. (1877–1947)

number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” (Hardy
1940)
Ramanujan could have added that 1729 is also the third Carmichael
number.
Hardy wrote two notable textbooks: A Course of Pure Mathematics,
which introduced generations of English students to rigorous Conti-
nental ideas in analysis, and An Introduction to the Theory of Num-
bers (1938) written with E. M. Wright, which is now in its fifth edition
and well worth study by any readers who want to go further into the
technicalities of prime number theory.
Hardy-Littlewood conjectures
We trust that it will not be supposed that we attach any exagger-
ated importance to the speculations which we have set out. . . .
We have not forgotten that in pure mathematics, and in the The-
ory of Numbers in particular, “it is only proof that counts.” It is
quite possible, in the light of the history of the subject, that the
whole of our speculations may be ill founded. Such evidence as
there is points, for what it is worth, in the opposite direction.
—Hardy and Littlewood (1923)
In one extremely long paper, Hardy and Littlewood published an
influential series of conjectures about how numbers might be repre-
sented in different forms, none of which they proved, though they
did give complicated formulae for the number of representations.
Here are some of them.
• Conjecture B: There are infinitely many prime pairs n and n +
k, for every even k.
• Conjecture E: The number of primes of the form n2 + 1 is infi-
nite and is equal to cn1/2/log n as n tends to infinity, where c
is approximately 1.3728134628 . . . (Finch 2003, 85)
This remains only a conjecture, but it has been shown that
there are an infinity of values of n2 + 1 that are either primes
or semiprimes.
Hardy and Littlewood generalized this to “k-tuples” of the
form N, N + a1, N + a2, . . . , N + ak, conjecturing that for any
given (a1, . . . , ak) there are an infinite number of Ns for which
the k-tuple N, N + a1, N + a2, . . . , N + ak will be all prime,
Hardy, G. H. (1877–1947) • 121

unless there is an elementary divisibility condition ensuring
that one of these must be composite. The twin primes conjec-
ture is the special case of N and N + 2.
• Conjecture H: Every large number is either a square or the sum
of a prime and a square.
• Conjecture K: If k is any fixed number other than a (positive
or negative) cube, then there are infinitely many primes of the
form m3 + k.
• Conjecture L: Every large number is either a cube or the sum
of a prime and (positive) cube.
• Conjecture M: If k is any fixed number other than zero, there
are infinitely many primes of the form a3 + b3 + k, where n and
m are both positive.
• Conjecture N: There are infinitely many primes of the form 
a3 + b3 + c3.
• Conjecture P: There are infinitely many prime pairs of the form
m2 + 1, m2 + 3.
Despite the hesitation they expressed in the quotation above, these
conjectures by two world-class mathematicians have stood the test of
time—even as proofs are still lacking.
Hardy and Littlewood also conjectured that p(x + y) ≥p(x) + p(y).
This conjecture, however, is inconsistent with the conjecture that
there are an infinite number of triples of primes of the forms 6n −1,
6n + 1, 6n + 5 and 6n + 1, 6n + 5, 6n + 7. Which plausible conjec-
ture is false? Probably the former. (Hardy and Littlewood 1923)
See formulae for primes; the prime numbers race
122 • Hardy, G. H. (1877–1947)
Primes of Polynomial Form
There is an infinite number of primes of the form x2 + y4 (Iwaniec
and J. Friedlander) and of the form x3 + 2y3.
n4 + 1 is prime for n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 20, 24, 28, 34, 46, 48, . . . (Sloane
A000068) (Lal 1967)
There is an infinity of primes of the form n2 + m2 or n2 + m2 + 1. If
b2 −4ac is a perfect square, then an2 + bn + c has algebraic factors.
Otherwise, and if a, b, and c are coprime in pairs and if a + b and c
are not both even, then there is an infinity of primes an2 + bn + c.

heuristic reasoning
Now for the . . . heuristic argument. The reader should be warned
that the following discussion involves some large leaps of faith.
—Robin Forman (1992)
G. H. Hardy considered the number of ways in which an even num-
ber n > 2 can be written as the sum of two primes, and argued like
this:
If m < n and n is large, the chance that m is prime is approximately 1: log
n. If then we write n in every possible way in the form m + m′, the chance
that both m and m′ are prime is approximately 1: (log n)2. We should there-
fore expect the order of magnitude . . . to be n/(log n)2. (Hardy 1966)
This is an example of a heuristic argument. It is less than convincing
because, as Hardy noted, the arithmetical form of n makes a differ-
ence to the answer. For a start, n must be even, unless n is 2 more
than a prime.
It turns out that to get a more accurate result that takes into
account the fact that n and n + 2 being prime are not actually inde-
pendent events, we have to multiply this heuristic estimate by a fac-
tor 1.32032 . . . This makes a large difference in practice: the result is
increased for large n by nearly one-third, yet the heuristic argument
was certainly on the right lines and takes the mathematician a long
way toward the correct conclusion.
(Brun proved that every even number is the sum of two numbers
with at most nine odd prime factors, and that the number of such
representations is also proportional to at least n/(log n)2.)
a heuristic argument by George Pólya
Pólya noted that while there are only eight pairs of twin primes less
than 100, there are twice as many, sixteen, primes p such that p + 6
is also prime: 5-11, 7-13, 11-17, 13-19, 17-23, 23-29, 31-37, 37-43, 41-
47, 47-53, 53-59, 61-67, 67-73, 73-79, 83-89, and 97-103. The propor-
tion of 1:2 continues when higher primes are checked. Up to
30,000,000 there are 152,892 twin prime pairs and 304,867 pairs dif-
fering by 6.
Having noticed this fact, Pólya, writing in 1959 when computers
were still quite weak, used data calculated by D. H. and Emma
heuristic reasoning • 123

Lehmer up to the limit 3  107 to compare the frequency of pairs, p
and p + d, in which both numbers are prime.
He noticed that the frequency of pairs p and p + d was roughly
equal for d = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Similarly, the data for d = 6, 12,
24, and 48 were roughly equal, and so were those for d = 10, 20, and
40 and d = 14, 28, and 56.
Pólya continued with his observations, finally drawing the conclu-
sion that if πd(x) is the number of pairs, p and p + d, both prime with
p < x, then
πd(x) is approximately equal to π2(x)Π( p −1)( p −2)
where the product is calculated over all the odd primes p that divide d.
Pólya then continued his argument by introducing an argument
based on probability, and got the answer he wanted, but only by an
argument that he knew to be flawed: to “correct” the flaw, he intro-
duced an extra factor and got the “correct” result, while admitting
that “I do not pretend to understand why the introduction of the
upper bound . . . should yield the right result.”
At this point we can leave George Pólya’s brilliant speculations, while
drawing the encouraging conclusion—which will astonish those peo-
ple who falsely believe that mathematics is always rock-solid and
purely logical—that such imaginative heuristic reasoning can lead to
correct answers and so contribute to mathematical progress, by point-
ing toward more complete and final arguments. (Pólya 1959)
Hilbert’s 23 problems
David Hilbert (1862–1943) was among the greatest mathematicians
of all time. He is of most interest to us because of a famous speech
that he delivered to the Second International Congress of Mathe-
maticians in Paris on August 8, 1900, on “The Problems of Mathe-
matics.” With the confidence that characterized his own work—his
cry, “We must know. We will know” is inscribed on his tomb in Göt-
tingen—he proclaimed:
This conviction of the solvability of any mathematical problem is a strong
incentive in our work; it beckons us: this is the problem, find its solution.
You can find it by pure thinking since in mathematics there is no Ignora-
bimus!
124 • Hilbert’s 23 problems

He then introduced his 23 famous problems. The eighth was prime
number problems. Hilbert asked for a proof of the Riemann hypothe-
sis, followed by an exact count of the number of prime numbers less
than N, and an answer to the question whether “the occasional con-
densation of prime numbers which has been noticed in counting
primes” is due to certain terms in one of Riemann’s formulae.
Hilbert then turned to Goldbach’s conjecture and the questions
“whether there are an infinite number of pairs of prime numbers
with the difference 2, or even the more general problem, whether
the linear diophantine equation
ax + by + c = 0
(with given integral coefficients each prime to the others) is always
solvable in prime numbers x and y.”
The ninth problem was: proof of the most general reciprocity law in
arbitrary number fields. This refers to generalizations of the law of
quadratic reciprocity.
The tenth problem was: decision on the solvability of a Diophantine
equation. This was eventually answered by Matijasevic, whose solu-
tion involved an extraordinary representation of the prime numbers.
See Goldbach’s conjecture; Matijasevic; quadratic reciprocity, law
of; Riemann hypothesis
home prime
Start with any number and form a new number by concatenating its
prime factors, starting with the least. Then repeat: 30 = 2  3  5 →
235 = 5  47 →547, which is prime, and the home prime of 30.
Similarly, the home prime of 4 is 211:
4 = 2  2 →22 = 2  11 →211
For n = 2, 3, . . . the home primes are 2, 3, 211, 5, 23, 7,
3331113965338635107, 311, 773, . . . (Sloane A037274)
Arguments from probability suggest that there is zero chance that
any sequence will not contain a prime, but it has not been proved
that no exceptional sequences exist.
home prime • 125

The largest home prime, HP(n), for n < 100 is known to be HP(49) =
HP(77), although it has not been calculated. The sequence starts, 49,
77, 711, 3379, 31109, 132393, 344131, . . . but calculation has stuck at
step 100, which has a 204-digit composite cofactor whose prime fac-
tors are unknown.
The next largest HP(n) for n < 100 is HP(80) = 313,169,138,
727,147,145,210,044,974,146,858,220,729,781,791,489. (De Geest and
Kruppa, MathWorld)
hypothesis H
Dickson’s conjecture was generalized in 1958 by Sierpinski and
Schinzel to polynomials in general. They called their generalization
hypothesis H.
Suppose that you have a number of polynomials in x, each with no
algebraic factors, with positive leading coefficients, and such that
there is no prime that necessarily divides their product, whatever the
value of x: then there is an infinity of values of x that makes them all
prime simultaneously.
The italicized condition excludes cases such as n2 + 2 and n2 + 1,
since their product, (n2 + 2)(n2 + 1), will be even whether n is odd
or even.
Hypothesis H implies there are infinitely many primes of the form
n2 + 1 and simultaneously of the forms n2 + 1 and 2n2 + 1 (such as 37
and 73 when n = 6, or 577 and 1153 when n = 24).
It also predicts, for example, that there are infinity of integral
Pythagorean triangles two of whose sides are primes, such as 3-4-5,
5-12-13, 11-60-61, and 19-180-181, since those sides will have the
form m2 −n2, 2mn, and m2 + n2, and the first and last expressions
would be prime simultaneously. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
illegal prime
Unauthorized playing of DVDs is illegal, so the Motion Picture Asso-
ciation of America has sued to stop the distribution of the DeCSS
code, which can be used to unscramble the Content Scramble System
used to protect DVDs. Not everyone is impressed, and this code, as
well as others with the same function, has been published freely on
the Internet and even printed on T-shirts. The code can also be trans-
126 • hypothesis H

formed into a number. After all, computers work on binary bits, so
that any program can be written as an integer.
Mathematics professor Phil Carmody has represented the DeCSS
code as a prime, not because he doesn’t believe in protecting artists’
rights—he does—but because he thinks the current law favors multi-
national publishers against consumers. The result is a 1,401-digit
prime that if transformed into hexadecimal would represent the
DeCSS code. Courts in the USA have decided that this program and
any version of it are an “illegal circumvention device” according to
the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, or DMCA, because they allow
copyright material to be shared without payment. Here it is:

inconsummate number
It is a well-known rule that if the digit-sum of a number is 9, then 9
divides the number exactly, but this is exceptional. Most numbers,
beyond the digits 1 to 9 themselves, are not divisible by their digit-
sum. Those that are form this sequence:

sum of its digits. John Conway has labeled these the inconsummate
numbers, and their sequence (Sloane A00365) for base 10 starts:
62, 63, 65, 75, 84, 95, 161, 173, 195, 216, 261, . . .
They exist, of course, for other bases also. These are the smallest
inconsummate numbers for bases 2 onward (Sloane A052491):

stroke of good fortune, while their proofs . . . elude all attempts
and defeat the sharpest enquiries.
—Gauss (Laubenbacher and Pengelley 1994)
Gauss in the extract above is describing one of the most delightful
but also baffling features of prime numbers, which was especially
obvious during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when basic
and beautiful properties of the primes were lying around as it were
like so many mathematical jewels waiting to be picked up by the
keen-eyed mathematical naturalist.
Fermat and Euler and Gauss himself were brilliant calculators who
noticed far more properties of the primes than they were able to prove,
even after in some cases decades of effort. So Fermat spotted that the
small Fermat numbers were prime, and then, as Gauss remarked, he
128 • inconsummate number

“was misled by his induction and affirmed that all numbers contained
in this form are necessarily prime.” (Gauss 1801/1966, 459)
Gauss inferred when a teenager, from his statistical data, that π (x),
the number of primes less than or equal to x, is approximately x/log
x, but this was only proved by Hadamard and Vallée Poussin in
1896.
Very many results in the theory of numbers were originally claimed
by the mathematician who discovered them, by experiment and
observation or sometimes by “loose” but plausible reasoning, only
to be proved (or disproved) later by someone else, which raises the
question: how confident can you be—should you be—when you
spot what appears to be a rock-solid pattern? Euler had one
answer:
For each of us can convince himself of this truth by performing the multi-
plication as far as he may wish; and it seems impossible that the law which
has been discovered to hold for 20 terms, for example, would not be
observed in the terms that follow. (Euler: Wells 1997, 64)
However, we can pick two possible holes in that reasoning. Euler
was talking about a series and in series or sequences such as
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, . . .
the pattern does seem to be extremely strong—this seems obviously
to be the triangular numbers—and yet, consulting that invaluable aid
to the modern mathematical naturalist, Neil Sloane’s On-Line Ency-
clopedia of Integer Sequences, there is a good chance that we shall
find more than one sequence that fits these seven starting values. So
let’s go to www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences, select the
“sequence” option, and type in, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28.
What do we get? The first result is, naturally, sequence A000217,
the triangular numbers, with their formula, n(n + 1)/2, and a list of
many ways in which they arise. They are, 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36,
45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, . . .
However, this entry is followed by many others that are not the tri-
angular numbers, but look much like them. Here are some of them.
• The sequence 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 35, 43, 52, 62, 73, 85,

order n.” This is followed by similar results for 9-, 10-, 11-, and
12-partite graphs.

products of the digits of all the numbers from 1 to n. (Murthy:
Conroy)
There are other sequences that start 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28. So we
have to fall back on Euler’s reference to “20 terms,” as if that were
far enough to provide complete confidence and total satisfaction.
Major Percy MacMahon remarked of one of his conjectures, “This
most remarkable theorem has been verified as far as the coeffi-
cient of x 89 by actual expansion so that there is practically no rea-
son to doubt its truth; but it has not yet been established.” (Pólya
1954, 96)
Wise words: the belief that 2n −1 −1 is only divisible by n if n is
prime is true up to n = 340, but then n = 341 is the first exception,
and the first (Fermat) pseudoprime.
D. H. and Emma Lehmer had to go much further to discover that
2n  3 (mod n) is first satisfied for n = 4,700,063,497. In other words,
if you continue this sequence of the remainders when 2n −3 is
divided by n, from n = 2 onwards,
1

. . .
then you only have 4.7 billion and a bit terms to go before the first
zero appears.
Another misleading result is that φ (30n + 1) > φ (30n) for all values
of n up to 20,000,000, yet it has been proved that eventually there is
an n for which φ (30n) > φ (30n + 1). (Newman 1997, 256–57)
G. H. Hardy remarked of Goldbach’s conjecture, “The numerical
evidence for the truth of the [conjecture] is overwhelming. It has been
verified up to 1000 by Cantor and . . . up to 10,000 by Haussner.”
Today, Goldbach’s conjecture has been checked up to 4  1014, but as
mathematicians know only too well, infinity is much bigger than 10n.

jumping champion
An integer is a jumping champion if it is the most frequently occur-
ring difference between consecutive pairs of primes. The idea was
suggested by Harry Nelson in 1978–1979, though the name was
given these numbers by John Conway in 1993. (Nelson 1978–79)
There are occasionally several jumping champions in a range. The
champion is 2 for these ranges of numbers: 7–100, 103–106, 109–
112, . . . Both 2 and 4 are joint champions for the ranges, 101–102,
107–108, 113–130, . . .
For n ≤1000, the champion is mostly 2, 4, or 6. The champion up
to about 1.74 × 1035 is 6, after which 30 predominates. The next
champion, 210, enters at about 10425. Since 2, 6, 30, 210, . . . is the
sequence of primorials, it is naturally conjectured that the sequence
of jumping champions consists of 1 and 4, and the primorials, the
next being 11# = 2310. (Odlyzko, MathWorld )
k-tuples conjecture, prime
How many triples of consecutive primes are there? We exclude 3-5-7
because it is one of a kind. Also, the remainders when we divide the
pattern n, n + 2, and n + 4 by 3 must be 0, 2, and 1 in that cyclic
order, so one of them is always divisible by 3.
So we focus on triples such as 5-7-11 and 7-11-13, of the form n, 
n + 2 or n + 4, n + 6. They exist for these values of n:
5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 37, 41, 67, 97, 101, 103, 107, 191, 193, 223, 227,
277, 307, 347, 457, 613, 641, . . . (Sloane A007529)
Of these, ten are of the n, n + 2, n + 6 form and twelve are of the n,
n + 4, n + 6 form. Up to 108 there are 55,600 triples of the form (p, 
p + 2, p + 6) and 55,556 of the form (p, p + 4, p + 6). (Caldwell, Prime
Pages) The Hardy-Littlewood prime k-tuples conjecture implies that
the total is about 55,490.
In a different kind of triple, the middle prime is the average of its
nearest neighbors. These are the middle primes:
5, 53, 157, 173, 211, 257, 263, 373, 563, 
593, 607, 653, 733, . . . (Sloane A006562)
k-tuples conjecture, prime • 131

It is not known if there is an infinity of quadruples of primes, or of
k-tuples in general, in arithmetic progression. Prime quadruplets,
sometimes known as a prime decade because their final digits in
base 10 must always be 1, 3, 7, and 9, cannot have the form n, n +
2, n + 4, n + 6 for the same reason as before—one of these numbers
must be a multiple of 4.
We also exclude 2-3-5-7 and 3-5-7-11, which both include the
“pathological” triple, 3-5-7, not to mention the unique even prime!
So we consider the set, n, n + 2, n + 6, and n + 8, and the quadru-
plets that start with 5-7-11-13, and continue with 11-13-17-19; 101-
103-107-109; 191-193-197-199; 821-823-827-829.
Subsequent sets start with these values of n: . . . 1481, 1871, 2081,
3251, . . . (Sloane A007530) The sequence includes the smallest
prime quadruplet of fifty digits. (Stevens 1995, 17–22)

knots, prime and composite
A prime number is one that cannot be “composed” of two other
numbers, so it is no surprise that “prime” is used metaphorically to
describe other mathematical objects that cannot be fitted together
from other (prime) pieces.
Composite knots can be formed by joining together on the same
string two other knots, called factor knots. Knots that are not com-
posite are prime. There is even a prime knots factorization theorem.
The ordinary trefoil knot is prime:

composite knot:

the loose ends to re-create the two prime knots on the left.
Landau, Edmund (1877–1938)
In 1903 Landau published a proof of the prime number theorem that
was simpler than those of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin.
Then in an address at the Fifth International Congress of Mathe-
maticians in Cambridge, England, in 1912 he described four prob-
lems that he said were “unattackable” in the present state of
knowledge. These were Goldbach’s conjecture, the twin primes con-
jecture, the existence of an infinity of primes of the form n2 + 1, and
the problem of the existence of a prime between n2 and (n + 1)2.
left-truncatable prime
Left-truncatable primes remain prime when the left-hand digit is
repeatedly removed. According to Chris Caldwell there are 4,260
such primes, of which the three longest are

Legendre, A. M. (1752–1833)
Legendre discussed the law of quadratic reciprocity, and mistakenly
believed that he had proved a theorem that was later proved by
Dirichlet: in every arithmetic sequence whose terms do not have a
common factor, there are an infinite number of primes.
In 1823 Legendre published his proof that Fermat’s equation, x 5 +
y 5 = z 5, has no solution in integers, and he proved that every num-
ber not of the form 8n + 7 is the sum of three squares.
He also produced one of the earliest estimates of π(x), conjectur-
ing in 1798, and again in 1808, that π(x), the number of primes less
than x, tends to
134 • Landau, Edmund (1877–1938)

π(x) = x/(log(x) −A)
as x tends to infinity: he supposed from his experimental evidence
that the best value of A was 1.08366 . . . known as Legendre’s con-
stant, which he published in his Théorie des Nombres in 1798. In
1850, Tchebycheff showed that the best figure, if the limit exists, is 1,
but he was unable to prove that the limit did indeed exist.
Lehmer, Derrick Norman (1867–1938)
D. N. Lehmer was an unusual mathematician: he published and
edited poetry and studied North American Indians, collecting their
legends and stories, as well as their music, which he used to com-
pose three musical works based on Indian culture.
In 1914 he published a List of prime numbers from 1 to 10,006,721,
unusually listing 1 as a prime. He had already published in 1909 a
table in book form of the largest factors of all the numbers up to
10,017,000, excluding numbers with the obvious factors, 2, 3, 5, and
the less obvious 7. He was also a founder of the Cunningham 
project.
Lehmer, Derrick Henry (1905–1991)
Derrick Henry Lehmer continued his father’s work on prime num-
bers, aided by his wife and coworker Emma Lehmer (1906– ), who
was originally his father’s graduate assistant. At age ninety, Emma
Lehmer has finished her research work, written up her husband’s
unfinished work, and overseen the publication of these materials.
D. H. Lehmer was one of the founders, in 1943, of the journal Math-
ematical Tables and other Aids to Computation, which in 1959 became
Mathematics of Computation. In his PhD thesis he proposed the Lucas-
Lehmer test for Mersenne primes. He also worked on ENIAC, the first
electronic computer in the United States. He was fascinated from his
student days with number sieves, electromechanical machines that
tested numbers to see if they satisfied certain congruences.
Lehmer’s machines searched a sequence of numbers, checking
automatically, by mechanical, electrical, or optical means or a com-
bination of methods, for numbers that left the required remainder
when divided by certain primes.
Lehmer, Derrick Henry (1905–1991) • 135

His first electromechanical number sieve was constructed in 1926,
using nineteen rotating bicycle chains. In 1932 he built a larger
machine using thirty-two gear wheels, which could check 300,000
numbers every minute. These devices were followed by others using
16mm film, then vacuum tubes and delay lines.
The 1932 geared sieve was demonstrated at the Chicago Century-
of-Progress Expositions. Sieves are still in use, for example at the
University of Manitoba, where Fung and Williams used one to find
quadratics with many prime values (see Euler’s quadratic). Their
sieve solves 133,000,000 linear congruences per second. (Rubinstein

Hunting Big Game in the Theory of Numbers
by Derrick N. Lehmer
On the 19th of October a little group of mathematicians gathered in
the Burt Laboratories in Pasadena, California, around a mysterious
machine to watch it attack a problem in mathematics. It was a sim-
ple enough problem to state. It had only to find two numbers which
when multiplied together would give 5,283,065,753,709,209. Any
person with a few hundred years of leisure time on his hands could
work it out. . . .
And after all we had taken only an important outwork in the
assault upon a real fortress. This victory had merely cleared the
decks for action against another and much larger number which was
under grave suspicion of being a prime; that is, not the product of
any two smaller numbers. This number is the great unconquered fac-
tor of 295 + 1. It is the nineteen digit number 3,011,347,479,614,
249,131.
On the 9th of October, just after the discovery of the “imp” the
machine was set to do some real work in the theory of numbers.
There was a large factor of 293
+
1, namely the number
1,537,228,672,093,301,419 which was known by a very powerful test
to be composite, but the test would not furnish the factors. The
smallest factor was known also to be larger than 300,000, and might
be large enough to occupy the time of a skilled computer for over
twenty-five years to find it. (Scripta Mathematica, September 1932)

Linnik’s constant
Dirichlet’s theorem proved that there are an infinite number of
primes in the arithmetic sequence,
a, a + b, a + 2b, a + 3b, . . . , a + nb
but when does the first prime occur? Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik
(1915–1972) showed in 1944 that there is a number L, Linnik’s con-
stant, such that the first prime is at most aL, independently of the
value of b, provided it is large enough.
Roger Heath-Brown proved in 1992 that L ≤5.5, but it is conjec-
tured that L = 2, which is certainly the correct figure for almost all
values of b.
Vinogradov’s celebrated proof of the ternary Goldbach’s conjecture
states that all large enough odd numbers can be written as the sum
of three primes. Linnik showed that for large n we can write n as the
sum of two primes and k powers of 2, where k is now known to be
at most 12.
Liouville, Joseph (1809–1882)
Liouville, among many achievements, proved the following extraor-
dinary property of the divisors of the divisors of a number:
Start with a number, say, 10, and write down its divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10.
Now write down the number of divisors of each divisor. They have
1, 2, 2, and 4 divisors, respectively.
Then:
(1 + 2 + 2 + 4)2 = 81 = 13 + 23 + 23 + 43
Similarly, the divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24, and the
number of their divisors are 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, and 8, respectively, and
(1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 8)2
= 13 + 23 + 23 + 33 + 43 + 43 + 63 + 83 = 900
Liouville, Joseph (1809–1882) • 137

This theorem also implies that if N is double an odd number and has
no factors of the form 4n + 3 (that remarkable distinction again!) and
if we write down the ways in which its even factors can be expressed
as the sum of two odd squares, then the sum of the cubes of the
numbers of ways will equal the square of their sum. For example,
50 = 12 + 72 = 72 + 12 = 52 + 52
10 = 32 + 12 = 12 + 32 and 2 = 12 + 12
and so:
33 + 23 + 13 = (3 + 2 + 1)2 = 62
(Dickson 1952, vol. 1, 286)
Littlewood’s theorem
John Edensor Littlewood (1885–1977) is best known for his long col-
laboration with G. H. Hardy on analytic number theory.
In 1914 he proved a very surprising theorem about two functions
for the number of primes less than or equal to x, π(x), and Li(x).
According to the table on p. 185, π(x) is always less than Li(x), and
indeed it is known that π(x) < Li(x) for all x ≤1012. Nevertheless Lit-
tlewood showed that π(x) < Li(x) is false infinitely often, despite the
apparently overwhelming numerical evidence to the contrary.
It is now known that there is a counterexample below 10400.
This proof that a function which is related to the Riemann hypothe-
sis can switch in value so far from the origin naturally undermines
the evidence that Riemann’s hypothesis is true, based on the calcu-
lation of its first few billion zeros. Who knows what might happen a
few billion farther on?
the prime numbers race
A similar phenomenon appears in the prime numbers race, though
the switch occurs much sooner. All primes from 5 onward are of one
of the forms 4n + 1 or 4n + 3. If we start counting the number in each
class, it seems that 4n + 3 always wins, but this is misleading: at
26861 the lead switches. Up to that limit, there are 1,473 primes of
the form 4n + 1 and only 1,472 of the form 4n + 3. (Leech 1957)
The succession of primes 4n + 1 and 4n + 3 is very irregular, as
might be expected. Thus the race between primes 4n + 1 and 4n + 3
is tied at: 2, 5, 17, 41, 461, 26833, 26849, 26863, 26881, 26893, 26921,
138 • Littlewood’s theorem

615769, 616793, 616829, 616843, . . . (Sloane A007351) The prime
26861 is of the form 4n + 1 and puts 4n + 1 into the lead for the first
time, but the lead is immediately lost.
The repeated equality at five values between 26833 and 26921, fol-
lowed by a large gap, suggests some resemblance between this
prime race and a random walk. As long as the random walk is near
the origin, it has a significant chance of returning to the origin in the
near future. The farther it moves away, the longer it is likely to stay
away.
For most of the first few billion numbers, 4n + 3 is winning over 
4n + 1. The sixth and largest known region for which 4n + 1 is lead-
ing stretches from 18,465,126,293 to 19,033,524,538.

is a sequence of nine consecutive primes of the form 4n + 1, discov-
ered by Den Haan, and 241603 is the start of thirteen consecutive
primes of the form 4n + 3. (Guy 1994, 13)
The race between 3n + 2 and 3n + 1 initially favors 3n + 2, though
there is an infinity of values of n for which 3n + 1 is leading, starting
with 608,981,813,029, found by Carter Bays and Richard Hudson on
Christmas Day 1976. The lead then changes repeatedly just above
608,981,813  103. It can be proved that the lead in all such prime
number races changes infinitely often.

Lucas, Édouard (1842–1891)
Lucas worked at the Paris Observatory as assistant to Le Verrier (who
had predicted the position of the new planet Neptune) and fought in
the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) in the artillery. He is reputed to
have lived in Paris in a house on the site of the house where Pascal
died. He himself died a bizarre death. At a banquet, a plate was
dropped and a chip flew up and cut his cheek. He died soon after
from erysipelas at the age of forty-nine.
He was deeply interested in number theory and its history. He was
a member of the committee that edited Fermat’s works for pub-
lication, and he wrote papers on astronomy, geometry, analysis,

combinatorics, and calculating devices, as well as number theory.
(Williams 1998, 53)
He also wrote several papers on the theory of weaving, a subject
that has a surprising connection with computing: the problem of
producing the most complex patterns in woven silk was solved by
Jacquard by using punched cards that selected the threads used dur-
ing the weaving of a particular pattern, making the Jacquard loom
the first “stored program” machine. Charles Babbage also used
punched cards to instruct his Difference Engine, which he used to
calculate the values of Euler’s quadratic, and these in turn were the
ancestors of the Holerith cards first used in a United States Census
and later in electronic computers. (Williams and Shallit 1994)
In 1879 Lucas started a column on recreational mathematics in
Revue Scientifique de la France et de L’Etranger, and later in La
Nature, and between 1882 to 1894 published a four-volume Récréa-
tions Mathématiques, which included magic squares and the Tower
of Hanoi, a puzzle that he invented in 1883 and published under the
anagram “N. Claus de Siam” (or Lucas d’Amiens) as “a game of com-
bination designed to explain the binary system of numeration,” as
the inside cover of the version sold to the public explained.
The object is to transfer all the rings from peg A to peg C, follow-
ing the rules that:
1. Only one ring may be moved at a time.
2. No ring may be placed on top of a smaller ring.
The puzzle created a sensation and was soon exploited in an
advertising version, the Eight Puzzle, in which each disk advertised a
different product. Lucas also made a giant version more than a meter
high for public display. It was sold with a story of the priests at the
140 • Lucas, Édouard (1842–1891)

Temple of Benares, where there is, “beneath the dome which marks
the center of the world, a brass plate in which are fixed three dia-
mond needles. On one of these needles God placed at the Creation
sixty-four disks of pure gold. . . . Day and night unceasingly the
priests transfer the disks from one diamond needle to another.”
When the sixty-four disks have all been transferred, relates Lucas,
“then towers, temple, and priests alike will crumble into dust, and
with a thunderclap the world will vanish.”
The point of his fable is that the minimum number of moves
needed to transfer n disks from one peg to another specified peg is
2n −1, a Mersenne number. (The method of moving the disks to min-
imize the moves required can also be represented by using binary
numbers.)
Lucas noted in the rules that came with the puzzle that “at one
move per second, it takes more than four minutes to move a tower
of eight rings,” which requires 255 moves. Contemporary illustra-
tions of the puzzle show ten rings, or a version with five pegs and
sixteen rings. The version using only three pegs would take more
than eighteen hours, supposing that no mistakes were made on the
way! To transfer sixty-four disks would take 264 −1 moves. At one
move per second, the priests would take more than 500 billion
years.
All the possible moves in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle can be repre-
sented in this diagram, which is for three disks only, and resembles
the pattern of Pascal’s triangle and Sierpinski’s gasket.
The notation “231,” for example, means that the smallest disk is on
peg 2, the middle disk on peg 3 and the largest disk is on peg 1. If

all three disks start on peg 1, then they can be moved to peg 2 in
seven moves by following the sequence down the right side of the
triangle.
The figure will always split up into three smaller triangles (and
then into smaller triangles still) because the shortest way to transfer
n disks from peg 1 to peg 2 is always to move n −1 disks from peg 1
to peg 3, then move the largest disk to peg 2, and then move n −1
disks from peg 3 to peg 2.

Lucas also wrote a book on the Theory of Numbers and studied the
Fibonacci sequence and the related sequence that is now called the
Lucas sequence:

(It sometimes is started: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, . . .)
It has the same rule of formation: each term is the sum of the previ-
ous two terms, so it is an example of a generalized Fibonacci
sequence.
If the first two terms are labeled L0 and L1, Lucas proved that if p
is prime, then Lp  1 (mod p). This is not a test for primality, how-
ever, because the converse is sometimes false: L705  1 (mod 705)
although 705 is composite. This conclusion is reminiscent of Fer-
mat’s Little Theorem and so the exceptions to the converse to
Lucas’s rule are called Lucas pseudoprimes. The only ones less than
100,000 are 705, 2465, 2737, 3745, 4181, 5777, and 6721. (Singmas-
ter 1983)
The Lucas sequence has, like the Fibonacci sequence, many other
properties:
Whereas every integer divides an infinity of Fibonacci terms, the
number 5 does not divide any term of the Lucas sequence:
L2n = Ln
2 −2(−1)n
Ln
2 = Ln −1Ln + 1 + 5(−1)n
and
LnLn + 3 = Ln + 1Ln + 2 + 5(−1)n
. . . illustrating that 5 has a special role in the Lucas sequence also.

The Fibonacci and Lucas sequences are also related: for example,
Ln = Fn −1 + Fn + 1
and
F2n = FnLn
Lm + n = 1⁄2(5FmFn + LmLn)
and so
L2n = 1⁄2(5Fn
2 + Ln
2)
Ln divides Lm if and only if n divides m and m/n is odd.
2 | Ln if and only if 3 | n; 7 | Ln if and only if n is an odd multiple of
4; 11 | Ln if and only if n is odd multiple of 5.
The Lucas sequence has periodic final digits with period 12: they go

The final two digits are periodic with period 60.
Like the Fibonacci sequence, the ratio Ln + 1/Ln tends to the Golden
Ratio, φ = 1⁄2(5 + 1) = 1.618 . . . Moreover, Ln is the closest integer to
φn. For example, φ9 = 76.01315 . . . and L9 = 76.
The sequence of prime Lucas numbers starts: 3, 7, 11, 29, 47, 199,
521, 2207, 3571, 9349, and then the very large 3010349, 54018521,
370248451, 6643838879, . . . (Sloane A005479)
Lucas also considered more general sequences that he used in his
work on primality testing. Binet had proved in 1843 that the
Fibonacci numbers Fn can be defined by this equation:
Fn =
where a and b are (1 + 5)/2 and (1 −5)/2, the roots of the 
equation x2 −x −1 = 0. Although these roots are irrational, these
functions of them are always integers—the numbers in the Fibonacci
sequence.
Lucas considered instead any equation x2 −Px + Q = 0, where P and
Q are coprime. If its roots are a and b, then he defined
Un =
and also
Vn = an + bn
(an −bn)

a −b
an −bn

a −b
Lucas Édouard (1842–1891) • 143

Once again, even if a and b are irrational, Un and Vn will always be
integers, and they satisfy the same recurrence relationship as the
Fibonacci numbers: each term is the sum of the previous two terms.
What is the point of these definitions? What are these generalized
Fibonacci numbers useful for? It was the genius of Lucas to realize,
and to show in a long paper published in 1878, that they were
related to a wealth of problems, including, as he wrote, “the the-
ory of determinants, combinations, continued fractions, divisibility,
divisors of quadratic forms . . . quadratic residues, decomposition of
large numbers into their prime factors, etc.” (Williams 1998, 71) He
also pointed out that they behaved in some ways like the trigono-
metrical functions, sine and cosine! They could also be used for pri-
mality testing.
primality testing
Lucas was the first mathematician to realize and demonstrate that
even very large numbers could be tested for primality without
recourse to tedious and impracticable trial division. He did this in a
series of thirteen papers all written between 1875 and 1878. (During
the same period he wrote more than seventy papers on various other
subjects—extraordinary productivity.)
By 1877, he had factorized the first sixty Fibonacci numbers.
(Mollin 2001, 27–28) In 1876 he showed that the gigantic (for that
era) Mersenne number M127 = 2127 −1 is prime. He used this test,
which required a great deal of calculation:
Let p = 24m + 3 −1, where 4m + 3 is prime. Form the sequence,
3, 7, 47, 2207, 4870847, . . .
in which S1 = 3 and Sn + 1 = Sn
2 −2. Then p is prime if the least value
of k such that p | Sk is 4m + 2.
This test is simple in theory but requires an enormous amount of
computation. How did Lucas do it, by hand? With typical ingenuity,
he used binary arithmetic and turned the calculation into a kind of
game, exploiting the fact that multiplication is mod p, using a 127-by-
127 chessboard. This is how he explained his method, adapted from
the account by Williams and Shallit (1994, 491–92), using the simpler
example of M7.
144 • Lucas Édouard (1842–1891)

Lucas’s game of calculation
Consider M7 = 27 −1 = 127. We have S1 = 3, S2 = 7, S3 = 47, S4 = 472 −
2  48 (mod 127), S5 = 482 −2  16 (mod 127), S6 = 162 −2  0 (mod
127).
So 127 | S6 but no smaller term, and so 127 is prime.
Next, Lucas noted that if Mn = 2n −1, then 2n + m  2m (mod Mn). In
this case, Mn = 127 = 27 −1 and so 27 + m  2m (mod 127).
The main operation of testing involves squaring, subtracting 2, and
reduction modulo 127. To perform this on S3 to calculate S4, we first
write S3 in binary, as 101111. Next, we start to square it by long mul-
tiplication:
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1
However, because we only need to find the answer modulo 127, and
we know that 27 + m  2m (mod 127), so 27  20, 28  21, 29  22, and
so on, we can put the six lines of the long multiplication into this
square array:
No. of column
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
Lucas suggested using part of a chessboard, with pawns for ones and
empty squares for zeros. Now that the pieces are arrayed, we follow
these two rules:
Lucas Édouard (1842–1891) • 145

1. Take (when possible but only once) a pawn away from col-
umn 2. This corresponds to subtracting 2 from the square. If a
pawn never appears in column 2, then 2 must be subtracted from
the final answer.
2. For each pair of pawns in any column, remove one from the
board and move the other into the column to the left, remem-
bering that the column to the left of column 7 is column 1.
Continue performing these operations until the only pawns remain-
ing are in the first row. In our case we get the first row to be,
No. of column
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0
which represents S4  48 in decimal.
Lucas claimed that these operations, with practice, could be per-
formed very quickly, and this was how he showed that M127 is prime.
On the other hand, it would seem easy to make a small mistake, with
no record left behind to be checked, so this no doubt explains why
Lucas always showed a slight uncertainty as to whether he really had
proved M127 prime.
the Lucas-Lehmer test
The converse of Fermat’s Little Theorem is false: there are numbers
that satisfy it but are not prime. However, Lucas in 1876 added an
extra condition to create a test for primality. Suppose we want 
to know if n is prime. If there is a number a such that an −1  1 
(mod n) (so n satisfies Fermat’s Little Theorem), and also am is not
congruent to 1 (mod n) for m = 1 to n −2, then n is prime.
This took a lot of calculation, however, especially before modern
computers were invented, so in 1891 Lucas shortened it. It was then
improved by Lehmer and Kraitchik. This is the result:
Suppose than n > 1. Then if for every prime factor q of n −1 there
is an integer a such that an −1  1 (mod n), and a(n −1)/q is not con-
gruent to 1 (mod n), then n is prime.
This test depends on the complete factorization of n −1. Pockling-
ton’s theorem is an improvement that requires only the partial fac-
torization of n −1.

lucky numbers
In 1955 Stanislav Ulam (1909–1984) and three colleagues at the Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory used an early computer to investigate a
sequence that strongly resembles the prime numbers.
The sieve of Eratosthenes leaves behind the prime numbers. It can
easily be modifed to leave behind different sequences of numbers.
Write down the natural numbers and delete every second 
number:
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
. . .
The first number remaining is 3, so delete every third number, start-
ing with 5. This leaves:
1
3
7
9
13
15
19
21
25
27
31
33
37
39
. . .
(This means that all numbers of the form 3n + 2 have been struck
out.) The first “unused” number is now 7, so delete every seventh
number. The next “unused” number is 9, so delete every ninth num-
ber. And so on. The final result is the sequence of lucky numbers:
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, 37, 43, 49, 51, 63, 67, 69, 73, 75, 79,
87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 115, 127, 129, 133, 135, 141, 151, 159, 163, 169,
171, 189, 193, 195, 201, 205, 211, . . . (Sloane A000959)
The largest known lucky number is 9,999,999,997. (Schneider 2002)
There are “fewer” lucky numbers than prime numbers, meaning that
although there is an infinity of each, the prime numbers are denser;
they occur in any largish finite interval with greater frequency.
Ulam and his colleagues used an “electronic computing machine”
to find the lucky numbers up to 48,000. There were 4,523, compared
to 4,947 primes in the same interval. They noted that the numbers of
luckies of the forms 4n + 1 and 4n + 3 were roughly equal, as they
are for the primes. Likewise, the gaps between successive lucky
numbers seem to roughly match those between primes, and every
even integer between 1 and 100,000 is the sum of two lucky num-
bers. The number of lucky twin pairs (differing by 2) is roughly that
lucky numbers • 147

of the twin primes. They also noticed that there are 715 numbers that
are both prime and lucky, up to 48,600 (though no one knows if
there is an infinity of prime lucky numbers). (Gardiner, Lazarus, Me-
tropolis, and Ulam 1956)
Walter Schneider in May 2002 calculated all lucky numbers up to
1010 and verified Goldbach’s conjecture to the same limit.

“random” primes
These parallels between the lucky numbers and the primes suggest
that many of the properties of the prime numbers depend only on
the fact that they can be created by a sieve. This conclusion is rein-
forced by other methods of creating “prime” numbers. For example,
Harald Cramér in 1936 imagined putting black and white balls into a
sequence of jars representing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . so that the
probability of drawing a white ball from the kth jar will be 1/log k.
Then he chose one ball from each jar in sequence and called these
“random primes.”
He then showed by probability theory that there is an infinity of
“twin random primes,” n and n + 1 (unlike ordinary primes, consec-
utive numbers can turn out to be random primes), and he drew other
conclusions that matched the actual or conjectured behavior of the
ordinary primes.
David Hawkins has studied another kind of random prime. Start with
the natural numbers,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, . . .
but instead of striking out every even number, strike out each num-
ber with probability one-half, for example, by tossing a coin when
you reach the number and throwing it out if you toss heads. This
148 • lucky numbers

will, on average, eliminate half the numbers. Suppose the numbers
remaining are
3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 23, . . .
The first remaining number, 3, counts as the first random prime.
Next, throw out every number with probability one-third. The re-
maining numbers could be
3, 5, 7, 10, 11, . . .
So 5 is the next “random” prime number. Now strike out each num-
ber greater than 5 with probability one-fifth, and so on. The result is
a sequence of “random” primes.
What can be said about these “random” primes? Well, with proba-
bility 1, the prime number theorem is true: the number of random
primes less than n tends to n/log n as n increases. There is also in
each sequence of random primes, with probability 1, an infinity of
“twin random primes,” n and n + 1, and their number tends to n/(log
n)2 as n tends to infinity. Heuristic arguments suggest the same for-
mula for the actual twin primes. (Hawkins 1958)

Matijasevic and Hilbert’s 10th problem
One of the most notorious of Hilbert’s 23 problems was the 10th:
does there exist a universal algorithm for solving Diophantine equa-
tions, that is, polynomial equations with integral coefficients and
integral solutions?
It was solved over many years by Martin Davis, H. Putnam, and
Julia Robinson, who took the first steps, and Yuri Matijasevic, who
took the final step in 1970, using the divisibility properties of the
Fibonacci numbers.
The solution was negative: no such algorithm exists, yet this nega-
tive conclusion had some very positive implications. Matijasevic’s
proof implies that there is a polynomial in twenty-three variables,
whose positive values, only, for integer values of the variables, are
the set of primes.
In 1976 J. P. Jones, D. Sato, H. Wada, and D. Wiens published their
version, a polynomial in twenty-six variables which, very conve-
niently, can be written down using the twenty-six letters of the
alphabet:
(k + 2){1 −[wz + h + j −q]2 −[(gk + 2g + k + 1)(h + j) + h −z]2 −[2n
+ p + q + z −e]2 −[16(k + 1)3(k + 2)(n + 1)2 + 1 −f 2]2 −[e3(e + 2)(a
+ 1)2 + 1 −o2] −[(a2 −1)y 2 + 1 −x 2]2 −[16r 2y 4(a2 −1) + 1 −u2]2 −
[((a + u2(u2 −a))2 −1)(n + 4dy 2) + 1 −(x + cu)2]2 −[n + l + v −y]2 −
[(a2 −1)l 2 + 1 −m2]2 −[ai + k + 1 −l −i]2 −[ p + l(a −n −1) +
b(2an + 2a −n2 −2n −2) −m]2 −[q + y(a −p −1) + s(2ap + 2a −
p2 −2p −2) −x]2 −[z + pl(a −p) + t(2ap −p2 −1) −pm]2}
At first sight this is very complicated. At second sight it looks at worst
like cheating, and at best like a trick, because it’s of the form (k +
2)(1 −A2 −B2 −C 2 . . .) where A, B, and C and so on are themselves
polynomials.
150 • Matijasevic and Hilbert’s 10th problem

In other words, it will only have positive values when A = B =
C . . . = 0, when the values will be k + 2 (which will be prime), and
we could just as well present it as this list of conditions:
0 = wz + h + j −q
0 = (gk + 2g + k + 1)(h + j) + h −z
0 = 2n + p + q + z −e
0 = (16k + 1)3(k + 2)(n + 1)2 + 1 −f 2
0 = e 3(e + 2)(a + 1)2 + 1 −o2
0 = (a2 −1)y 2 + 1 −x 2
0 = 16r 2y 4(a2 −1) + 1 −u2
0 = ((a + u2(u2 −a))2 −1)(n + 4dy)2 + 1 −(x + cu)2
0 = n + l + v −y
0 = (a2 −1)l 2 + 1 −m2
0 = ai + k + 1 −l −i
0 = p + l(a −n −1) + b(2an + 2a −n2 −2n −2) −m
0 = q + y(a −p −1) + s(2ap + 2p −p2 −2p −2) −x
0 = z + pl(a −p) + t(2ap −p2 −1) −pm
Matijasevic’s construction can be applied to other sets of numbers, in
fact to any set that is recursively enumerable, meaning roughly that it
is generated by addition, multiplication, decisions based on in-equal-
ities, and selecting an element from a list. For example, the set of
Mersenne primes is the set of positive values of this polynomial, in
thirteen variables, where the variables range over the non-negative
integers.
Mersenne numbers and Mersenne primes
The friar Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), a member of the order of
Minims, was a philosopher, mathematician, and scientist who wrote
on music, mechanics, and optics, suggested to Christian Huygens
that a pendulum might be used to measure time, and defended
Christianity against Skepticism. He also occupied a unique role as a
correspondent who linked together no fewer than seventy-eight
philosophers and mathematicians across Europe, including Des-
cartes, Fermat, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, Blaise Pas-
cal and his father, Etienne, who met as Mersenne’s guests, and others
who corresponded through him—he was a kind of international post
box—including Huygens, Torricelli, and Galileo.
Mersenne numbers and Mersenne primes • 151

Mersenne numbers
If 2n −1 is prime, then n is prime, because if n had a prime factor p
then 2p −1 would divide 2n −1. If n = pq, then
2n −1 = (2p −1)(2pq −p + . . . + 23p + 22p + 2p + 1)
The converse, however, is not always true. If n is prime, 2n −1 may
be either prime or composite.
Mersenne famously speculated in his book Cogitata Physico-
Mathematica (1644) that 2n −1 is prime when n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17,
19, 31, 67, 127, and 257 and no other n less than 257.
This is an extraordinary list, because numbers such as 267 −1 are
so large: how could Mersenne have possibly been confident that
they were prime? No one in his day had any satisfactory method of
deciding whether such large numbers were prime or composite.
Anyway, Mersenne’s list contains several mistakes. The numbers
M67 and M257 are composite, and the missing M61, M89, and M107 are
prime—but these errors were not finally demonstrated until three
hundred years later, by A. Ferrier in 1947.
hunting for Mersenne primes
• In 1536 Hudalricus Regius showed that 211 −1 = 2047 = 23  89
is not prime.
• In 1603 Pietro Cataldi correctly announced that M17 and M19
were prime, and falsely claimed for M23, M29, and M37. Fermat
corrected him on M23, and M37 in 1640.
• In 1750 Euler, who had already corrected Cataldi on M29,
showed that M31 is prime. This was the largest known prime
for over a hundred years, from 1772 to 1876.
• In 1876 Lucas concluded that
M127 = 170141183460469231731687303715884105727
is prime, though he never seemed entirely convinced by his
own calculations. This was the record large prime until 1951,
and the largest ever to be calculated by hand.
• In 1883 Pervouchine showed that M61 is prime, missing from
Mersenne’s list.
• Powers announced in 1911, in “The Tenth Perfect Number”
(American Mathematical Monthly 18), that M89 is prime, also
correcting Mersenne. He also showed that M107 is prime, in
1914.
152 • Mersenne numbers and Mersenne primes

• In 1903 F. N. Cole proved that M67, on Mersenne’s list, is com-
posite.
• Mersenne’s list was finally and completely checked only after
World War II: Mersenne numbers are prime for n = 2, 3, 5, 7,
13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, and 127, up to the limit 257.
the coming of electronic computers
In 1952 Robinson proved that M521, M607, M1279, M2203, and M2281 are
prime, the first successes using a modern computer. The advent of
electronic computers has made the hunt for Mersenne primes more,
not less, competitive. When Gillies of the University of Illinois found
the 23rd Mersenne prime, 211213 −1, the math department changed its
postage meter to print “211213 −1 is prime” on every envelope.
On November 14, 1978, a press release announced, “Two 18-year-
old youths, Laura Nickel and Curt Noll, have calculated the largest
known prime number, 2 to the 21,701st power minus one, using a
terminal at California State University, Hayward and hooking into the
CYBER 174 in the Los Angeles area. Totaling 6,533 digits, the num-
ber was proved to be prime last October 30 after three years of dili-
gent study and work interrupted at times by official and personal
problems.” The news made the front page of the New York Times.
Nickel and Noll got hooked on computer calculation in high
school, and wrote their program with information from the local Cal
State University math department. They ran their program for 440
hours when the CYBER 174 was not otherwise in use.
This was the 25th Mersenne prime. Noll went on to discover the
26th, M23209, which has 13,395 digits, and later worked for Silicon
Graphics, where most of the recent largest prime number records
have been set, by David Slowinski, Paul Gage, and others. Noll is
also a member of the EFF Cooperative Computing Awards Team, and
one of the Amdahl Six who discovered 235235  270000 −1, a number
of 21,078 digits and briefly the largest non-Mersenne prime known.
Silicon Graphics takes part in GIMPS, the Great Internet Mersenne
Prime Search.

composite.

The latest Mersenne primes may possibly not be the 39th, 40th, and
41st, because not all the smaller Mersenne numbers have yet been
checked.
Mersenne numbers and Mersenne primes • 155
This is how MathWorld Headline News, at http://mathworld.wolfram
.com/news, reported (June 1, 2004) the latest record: “Josh Findley, a
participant in the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), iden-
tified the 41st known Mersenne Prime on the morning of May 15. The
discovery was confirmed on May 29, making 224036583 −1 the largest
known Mersenne prime, as well as the largest prime number known.”
Mersenne prime conjectures
All known Mersenne primes are squarefree, and it seems likely that
they all are, because it is known that if the square of a prime, p 2,
divides a Mersenne prime, then p is a Wieferich prime, and these are
very rare. Just two Wieferich primes less than 4  1012 are known, and
neither of them divides a Mersenne prime.
It was a natural speculation that if Mp is prime then MMp is also
prime. For example, M2 = 3, and sure enough, M3 = 7 is prime: M5 =
31 and M31 is prime, as Euler proved in 1750. But the conjecture is
nevertheless wrong: M13 = 8191 is prime, but M8191 turns out to be
composite.
Catalan in 1876 made a more limited conjecture: the sequence of
Mersenne numbers
22 −1 = 3
23 −1 = 7
27 −1 = 127
and 2127 −1 is also prime. Unfortunately, the next term has more than
1038 digits and cannot be tested at present.

the New Mersenne conjecture
This is the New Mersenne conjecture, made by Paul Bateman, Paul
Selfridge, and Stan Wagstaff. Let p be an odd prime: then the follow-
ing two statements are equivalent:
1. Mp is prime.
2. These two statements are either both true or both false:
a. (2p + 1)/3 is prime.
b. p is of the form 2k  1 or 4k  3.
how many Mersenne primes?
It is not known whether there are infinity of Mersenne primes, or
indeed an infinity of Mersenne composites. In Unsolved Problems in
Number Theory, Richard K. Guy says of Mersenne primes, “their
number is undoubtedly infinite, but proof is hopelessly beyond
reach.” He then offers some suggestions for the size of M(x), the
number of primes p ≤x for which 2p −1 is prime.
Gillies suggested M(x) is approximately c log x. The constant c could
be eγ, where γ is Euler’s constant. Pomerance suggested M(x) is
approximately c (log log x)2.

(Baxa 1993)
If the Mersenne primes, 2p −1, are put on a graph by plotting log p
against n, then you do get a remarkably “straight” line. On the basis
of such data and an ingenious heuristic argument, Wagstaff conjec-
tured in 1983 that:

1. Mx is about (eγ/log 2)(log log x) or roughly 2.5695 . . . (log
log x).
2. The number of Mersenne primes Mq with x < q < 2x is about
eγ = 1.7806 . . .
3. The probability that Mq is prime is about (eγ log aq)/(q log
2) where a = 2 if q is of the form 4n + 3 and a = 6 if q is of the
form 4n + 1.
Eberhart’s conjecture
Eberhart conjectured that if qn is the nth prime such that Mqn is a
Mersenne prime, then qn is approximately (3/2)n, if n is large enough.
factors of Mersenne Numbers
Proving that a Mersenne number is composite tells you nothing
about its actual factors, and only some Mersenne composites have
been factored. (Incidentally, Mersenne numbers written in base 2
consist of all 1s, and so they are binary repunits and there is a con-
nection with the problem of factorizing the repunits in general.)
It helps to know some basic theorems about the factors of Mersenne
primes. For example, if p is an odd prime, then any divisor of Mp is
of the form 2kp + 1.
Euler proved in 1750 that if p is a prime of the form 4n + 3, then 
2p + 1 is a factor of Mp if and only if 2p + 1 is also prime (so p and
2p + 1 are a pair of Sophie Germain primes). In this case, Mp is com-
posite, with the exception of the case p = 3, when M3 = 7 and it is
true that 2  3 + 1 = 7 divides M3, but it is not composite.
For example, M11 = 2047, and 11 is prime and 11 = 4  2 + 3, and 2
 11 + 1 = 23 is also prime, so 23 | 2047, which is true.
Similarly, if n divides Mp, then n is of the form 8m  1. Using the
same example, M11 = 2047 = 23  89, and 89 = 8  11 + 1 and 23 
= 8  3 −1.
Here are just a handful of factorizations:
M11 = 2,047 = 23  89

Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne primes
The Lucas-Lehmer test definitely determines whether a Mersenne
number is prime or not. 
The test was invented by Lucas and refined by Lehmer in about
1930. This is how it works. Define the sequence,
S(1) = 4, S(2) = 14, S(3) = 194, S(4) = 37634, . . .
where S(n + 1) = S(n)2 −2. Then M2n + 1 is prime if and only if M2n + 1
divides S(2n).
The values of S(n) rapidly become very large indeed, but fortunately
they do not need to be calculated directly to run the test. For exam-
ple, M13 = 8191, so this will divide S(12) if and only if 8191 is prime.
Since we are only interested in divisibility, we can do the entire cal-
culation modulo 8191, like this, using a hand calculator:
S(4)
=
37634
 4870
(mod 8191)
S(5)

And so 8191 is prime. Of course, this is not a brilliant way of testing
a number the size of 8191 which we could also test by dividing by
all the primes less than 8191
 = 90.5 . . . ! But this method works
efficiently for much larger numbers.

Mertens constant
The sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, but very slowly. Let
P(p) = 1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄5 + 1⁄7 + . . . + 1⁄p
The sum from 1⁄2 to 1⁄p is approximately log log p, and we have the
beautiful result that P(p) −log log p tends to the Mertens constant,
M = 0.261497212847642 . . .
as p tends to infinity. (Sloane A077761)
See Brun’s constant
Mertens theorem
Approximately half of all numbers are divisible by 2, and so half are
not. We have to say “approximately” because, for example, between
1 and 11 inclusive, only five out of eleven are even! (The argument
only works perfectly for even numbers.)
Similarly, approximately one-half are not divisible by 3 and one-
half multiplied by one-third are divisible by neither 2 nor 3. (This
conclusion is also only exactly true for multiples of 2 and 3.) In gen-
eral, approximately,
(1 −1⁄2)(1 −1⁄3)(1 −1⁄5)(1 −1⁄7) . . . (1 −1⁄pn)
are divisible by none of the primes from 2 to pn. The table shows this
product, approximately, for primes up to 1,000,000:

So about 77% of numbers are divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, while roughly
94% are divisible by a prime under 10,000. (Young 1998)
According to the prime number theorem, the number of primes ≤n
is n/log n, and so the proportion of numbers ≤n that are prime is
1/log n. Does this mean that the product
(1 −1⁄2)(1 −1⁄3)(1 −1⁄5)(1 −1⁄7) . . . (1 −1⁄pn)
tends to 1/log n as n tends to infinity? No! The sources of error we
have noted are cumulative, and the value of product tends to e−γ/
log n, with an error factor roughly proportional to n. This is
Mertens theorem.
See heuristic reasoning
Mills’ theorem
W. H. Mills proved in 1947 a theorem that is as amazing as it is use-
less. He proved that there is a number, A, such that A3n is prime for
all integer values of n. Even more surprisingly, Mills did not give an
actual value for A—his proof was nonconstructive.
This is indeed a formula for prime numbers, but it is useless in
practice because you need to know A to a very large number of dec-
imal places to get even a few primes out, and you need to know the
primes generated before calculating A.
The smallest possible value of A, known as Mills’ number, has been
calculated as,
1.3063778838630806904686144926026057129167845851567 . . .
This leads to the sequence of primes starting, 2, 11, 1361,
2521008887, . . .
There is an infinity of other possible values of A.

Wright’s theorem
Inspired by Mills, E. M. Wright proved that there is a number a, such
that if G0 = a and gn + 1 = 2gn then [gn], the integral part of gn, n > 1,
is always a prime. He gave the example a = 1.9287800 . . . when
[g1] = 3, [g2] = 13, [g3] = 16381, and [g4] has about 5,000 digits. (Wright

There is such a cornucopia of results about primes that they could
not possibly fit into a much larger book than this, and nor can they
all be easily and neatly classified, so here is a small bundle of mis-
cellaneous results.

multiplication, fast
Not only is it incomparably easier to multiply two large numbers
together than it is to reverse the operation and factorize the product
into the original numbers, but it is possible to multiply very large
numbers almost as quickly as they can be added.
This seems counterintuitive. Any schoolchild will tell you that multi-
plication by hand is much more time-consuming than addition, and in
general, following the usual algorithm for long multiplication, it would
seem necessary to make about n2 small calculations to multiply two 
n-digit numbers together (plus a much smaller number of additions).
Not so! Suppose that we have two numbers A and B represented
in binary notation. If each has 2n digits, then we can split them into
halves by writing them as
162 • multiplication, fast

A = 2na + a′
B = 2nb + b′
Then,
AB = (22n + 2n)ab + 2n(a −a′)(b −b′) + (2n + 1)a′b′
This has reduced the original multiplication—which we assumed
would take (2n)2 = 4n2 multiplications plus a bit of addition—to
three multiplications of about n2 operations each.
This in itself is a saving of about 25%. However, when multiplying
very large numbers, this process can be repeated. It turns out that the
running time for large multiplications can be reduced from round
about n2 to n1.585, a great saving.
Is this the limit? No! By even more cunning methods, extremely
large numbers can be multiplied in a time that is nearly propor-
tional to the length of the numbers. Even better, if you have a
computer with an unlimited number of components all acting
simultaneously, then it is possible to design a device such that, “If
we wire together sufficiently many of these devices in a straight
line, with each module communicating only with its left and right
neighbours, the resulting circuitry will produce the 2n-bit product
of n-bit numbers in exactly 2n clock pulses.” (Knuth 1981, 297)
Now that is magic!
Niven numbers
Niven numbers are named after Ivan Niven, author of An Intro-
duction to the Theory of Numbers (1960). (They were also labeled
multidigital numbers, or Harshad numbers, by Kaprekar, Harshad
meaning “great joy” in Sanskrit.) They are integers divisible by the
sum of the digits. Their sequence in base 10 starts
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20, . . .
(Sloane A005349)
In 1994, Grundman proved that at most twenty consecutive Niven
numbers are possible and produced an infinite family of such
sequences, the smallest one of 44,363,342,786 digits.
There is an infinity of numbers that are both Niven and Smith. (Weis-
stein, MathWorld )
Niven numbers • 163

odd numbers as p + 2a2
The conjecture that every odd number can be written as p + 2a2,
where p is unity or a prime and a could be zero, is false. Only two
counterexamples, however, are known, 5777 and 5993. (Ashbacher:
Caldwell, Prime Pages)
Opperman’s conjecture
In 1882 Opperman claimed that if n > 1 then π(n2 + n) > π(n2) >
π(n2 −n). This has never been proved, though the evidence is com-

palindromic primes
There are fifteen palindromic primes consisting of three digits: 101,
131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, and
929. The only palindromic prime with an even number of digits is 11.
The current record for the largest known palindromic prime is held
by Harvey Dubner, who found on April 5, 2004, 10120016 + 1726271
 1060005 + 1, which has 120,017 digits. His previous record was
(1989191989)15601, containing 15,601 digits, announced in October
2001. The notation means that 1989191989 is repeated 1,560 times
and then a 1 is put on the right-hand end.

pandigital primes
The digits 1 to 9 cannot be arranged to make a prime number,
because their sum, 45, is divisible by 3, and so therefore is any
arrangement of them. However, you can add an extra unit to make 
a prime. The first few of these are 10123457689, 10123465789,
10123465897, 10123485679, 10123485769, . . . (Sloane A050288)
If you exclude zero, the smallest pandigital primes are 1123465789,

Dubner and Ondrejka discovered the smallest pandigital prime that
is also palindromic: 1023456987896543201 (Caldwell, Prime Pages)

Pascal’s triangle is formed by starting and ending every row with 1,
and using the rule that each entry is the sum of the two entries above
it in the previous row.
Pascal’s triangle and the binomial coefficients • 165

The entries are also the binomial coefficients that appear when cal-
culating algebraic expressions such as
(1 + n)8 = 1 + 8n + 28n2 + 56n3 + 70n4 + 56n5 + 28n6 + 8n7 + n8
Binomial coefficients can also be calculated directly. Counting the
unit at the top of the triangle as row zero, the 4th entry in the 8th row
is 56, and
= 56
Ignoring the end units, which entries are divisible by their row
number if we count the top unit as row zero? A quick check shows
that if p is prime, then all of row p (the units excluded) are divisi-
ble by p.
This is the pattern created. Zero (0) indicates an entry that is divisi-
ble by the row number without remainder:

It is less obvious, but true, that the entries in row n, excluding the
ends, are divisible by prime p if and only if n is a power of p.
The middle term in every other row is (2n
n ), which is always divisible
exactly by n + 1.
How many coefficients are not divisible by the row number? Surpris-
ingly, the number as a proportion of all the entries drops to zero as
the number of rows tends to infinity. Almost all entries are divisible
by their row number. (Harborth 1977)

 Pascal triangle curiosities
• How many times does a particular number occur in Pascal’s
triangle? David Singmaster pointed out that 120, 210, 1540,
7140, 11628, and 24310 each occur six times, among numbers
less than 248. He has also proved that an infinity of numbers
occur at least six times each.
The Fibonacci sequence also appears in Pascal’s triangle, along these
diagonals:

• Erdös conjectured in the 1930s that if n > 4, then (2n
n ) is never
squarefree, and Sarkösy proved it in 1985 for all sufficiently
large n. Goetgheluck has confirmed that it is true if n is not a
power of 2 and if n < 242205184.
• Erdös, Lacampagne, and Selfridge have conjectured that if p is
the smallest prime factor of the binomial coefficient (k
N), and k
is at least 2, then p is at most (k
N) or 29 whichever is the larger.
• The number of odd entries in the nth row is 2k, where k is the
number of 1s in the binary representation of n. For example,
11 = 10112, so there are eight odd entries in row 11. In partic-
ular, in rows 3, 7, 15, 31, . . . all the entries are odd.
• For positive integers n and k and n ≥2k, (k
n) has a prime fac-
tor greater than k.
• Erdös proved that at least one of the binomial coefficients (r
n)
is not square-free if n > 23. Moreover, for some Nr, depending
on r, if n > Nr then at least one of (r
n) is divisible by an rth
power of some prime. (Erdös and Eynden 1992)
patents on prime numbers
The best-known use of number theory in the real world is the use of
primes in public key encryption. This makes certain large primes and
algorithms commercially valuable. So Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman
filed patent number 4,405,829 on December 14, 1977, titled “Crypto-
graphic Communications System and Method,” on their RSA algo-
rithm. A company was formed, called RSA Data Security, and was
granted an exclusive license on the RSA patent. However, since it
was published before the patent application, it could not be patented
under European and Japanese law. American readers may be
encouraged to know that the RSA patent expired in 2000!
Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman were less fortunate. On August
19, 1980, they filed a patent, No. 4,218,582, for a “Public-Key Cryp-
tographic Apparatus and Method,” based on the knapsack problem,
which requires items of different size to be fitted into a knapsack of
given volume. Two years later Leonard Adleman solved the simplest
version of Merkle’s problem. Merkle promptly advertised in the
pages of Time magazine a reward of $1,000 for anyone who could
break a repeated iteration knapsack problem. Again he failed: Ernie
Brickell cracked an iteration problem with forty iterations in just one

hour on a Cray-1 supercomputer. That was the end of Merkle’s knap-
sack method for all practical purposes.
More recently, Roger Schlafly obtained U.S. Patent 5,373,560 in
1994 for two primes, of which this is the smaller, represented in
hexadecimal notation:
98A3DF52AEAE9799325CB258D767EBD1F4630E9B9E217

AF099660BDDC1577E54A9F402334433ACB14BCB
Since Schlafly is a member of the League for Programming Freedom,
which is opposed to patenting computer software, he presumably
had his tongue in his cheek.

Pépin’s test for Fermat numbers
Father Jean Pépin (1826–1904) was a Jesuit priest who published sev-
eral papers on methods of factorization. In 1877 he published his test
for the primality of Fermat numbers.
F(k) is prime if and only if k > 1 and 5(F (k) −1)/2 + 1 is divisible by F(k)
For example, F(2) = 17 and 5(17 −1)/2 + 1 = 58 + 1 = 390626 = 17  22978
The test is usually presented today with 3 in place of 5.
Ironically, however, because so few Fermat primes are known, Pépin’s
test has never been used successfully to show that a Fermat number is
prime!
In 1905 J. C. Moorhead and A. E. Western both used Pépin’s test to
show that F7 is composite without finding the factors, which were
calculated in 1970 by John Brillhart and M. Morrison:
F7 = (29  116,503,103,764,643 + 1)
 (29  11,141,971,095,088,142,685 + 1)
In 1909 Moorhead and Western collaborated to prove that F8 is com-
posite, using Pépin’s test. (Koshy 2002)
The largest Fermat number that has been tested using Pépin’s theo-
rem is F24 in 1999 by Mayer, Papadopoulus, and Crandall. (Rivera,
Conjecture 4)

perfect numbers
It is recorded that all God’s works were completed in six days,
because six is a perfect number. . . . For this is the first number
made of divisors, a sixth, a third, and a half, respectively, one,
two, and three, totaling six.
—St. Augustine of Hippo, The City of God
A perfect number is the sum of all its proper divisors (so it is neither
abundant nor deficient). The second perfect number is 28, which
Plutarch noted was the number of members in the Senate at Sparta.
On the other hand, Alcuin (735–804), who was Charlemagne’s
teacher, noted that since the human race was descended from eight
souls in Noah’s Ark, and 8 is deficient, therefore this second creation
was inferior to the first. (Ore 1948/1988, 94)
Euclid presented perfect numbers in his Elements. He defined them in
VII, Definition 22, and then in Book IX proposition 36, claimed that:
If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit be set out continu-
ously in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes prime, and if the
sum multiplied into the last make some number, the product will be perfect.
In other words, you add up the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . until you
get a prime and then multiply the sum by the last term. So the first
four perfect numbers are:
6
= (1 + 2)  2
28
= (1 + 2 + 4)  4
496
= (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)  16
8128 = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64)  64
and sure enough, each number is the sum of its proper factors:
6
= 1 + 2 + 3
28
= 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
496
= 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248
8128 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 
+ 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064
Euclid claimed that every number of this form is perfect, but not that
every (even) perfect number is of this form: that was proved by Euler
in 1747. It follows that finding perfect numbers amounts to finding
170 • perfect numbers

Mersenne primes and the largest known perfect number will be
derived directly from the record Mersenne prime.
The first four perfect numbers were known to Nicomachus of Gerasa
(c. AD 100), and to Iamblichus, who wrote a commentary on Nico-
machus’s Arithmetic, and suggested that there might be one perfect
number for each number of digits, suggesting that there is something
special about base 10. This is false.
It was also a natural assumption that since 2, 3, 5, and 7 produce
perfect numbers, the next would be for 11, which is also false: 211 −
1 = 2047 = 23  89.
The perfect numbers also seem to end in either 6 or 8, which is
true, and to do so alternately, which is again false. The final digits of
the known perfect numbers go, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8,
8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 6, . . . (Sloane
A094540)
The fifth perfect number was found in 1536 by Hudalricus Regius,
who showed that 213 −1 = 8191 is prime, so 33550336 = 212(213 −1)
is perfect. Then J. Schleybl in 1555 found the sixth: 8589869056 =
216(217 −1). Pietro Antonio Cataldi (1548–1626) rediscovered the fifth
and sixth and added the seventh: 137438691328 = 218(219 −1).
Cataldi, like Mersenne later, then made an error. He correctly claimed
that 2p −1 is prime for p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, and 19 and then added
23, 29, 31, and 37, of which only 31 is correct.
Peter Barlow was a very reliable calculator whose Tables (1814) of
factors, squares, cubes, square roots, reciprocals, and natural loga-
rithms up to 10,000 is still in print. He made a famous remark in his
book Elementary Investigation of the Theory of Numbers (1811) that
230(231 −1) = 2,147,483,647 “is the greatest [perfect number] that will
be discovered; for as they are merely curious, without being useful it
is not likely that any person will attempt to find one beyond it.”
How close can a non-perfect number be to perfection? Powers of 2
are only just deficient: so if n = 2k, then σ(n) = 2n −1. Such num-
bers are called almost perfect. It isn’t known if there are any others.
What about σ(n) = 2n + 1? These have been called quasi-perfect,
and they must be odd squares, but no one knows if any exist. (Guy)
Every multiple of a perfect number is abundant, and every factor is
deficient.

odd perfect numbers
Descartes, one of Mersenne’s many correspondents, wrote to him in
1638 that:
I think I am able to prove that there are no even numbers which are per-
fect apart from those of Euclid; and that there are no odd perfect numbers,
unless they are composed of a single prime number, multiplied by a square
whose root is composed of several other prime numbers. But I can see
nothing which would prevent one from finding numbers of this sort. For
example, if 22021 were prime, in multiplying it by 9018009 which is a
square whose root is composed of the prime numbers 3, 7, 11, 13, one
would have 198585576189, which would be a perfect number. But, what-
ever method one might use, it would require a great deal of time to look
for these numbers.
Descartes points out that if p = 22021 were prime and if s = 3  7 
11  13, then ps2 would be an odd perfect number—but 22021 = 61 
192. (Crubellier and Sip 1997, 389–410)
All even perfect numbers are of Euclid’s form, but could there be
an odd perfect number? No one knows, but it is a typical curiosity of
mathematics that you can say a great deal about an object that may
not exist at all! So mathematicians have proved that if an odd perfect
exists, it has at least eleven prime factors, must be greater than 10300,
the largest prime factor must be greater than 500,000, the second
largest must be greater than 1000, and its prime factorization must
consist of even powers of all its prime factors but one, which appears
as an odd power.
On the other hand, if it has k distinct prime factors, then it is less
than 44k. (Guy 1994)
The only even perfect number of the form an + bn with n > 1, and a
and b coprime, is 28.
See perfect, multiply; Sierpinski numbers; unitary perfect

A number is multiply perfect if σ(n) = kn, with k ≥2, so ordinary per-
fect numbers are doubly perfect. The first triply perfect number (P3 )
for which σ(n) = 3n is 120 = 233  5: σ(120) = 360.
Fermat found the second triply perfect number, 672 = 253  7 for
which σ(672) = 2016 = 3  672. The third P3, 523776 = 29  11  31,
was discovered by Father Jumeau in 1638.

Descartes announced this P3: 1476304896 = 2133  11  31
and these six P4s:

and also this P5:
14182439040
= 2734  5  7  112  17  19.
The common prime factors in these examples are due to Descartes’s
method for creating new multiply perfect numbers from old, which
included these rules:
1. If n is a P3 not divisible by 3, then 3n is a P4.
2. If a P3 is divisible by 3, but by neither 5 nor 9, then 4  5 P3
is a P4.
3. If a P3 is divisible by 3, but not by 7, 9, or 13, then 3  7  13
P3 is a P4.
(Dickson 1952, vol. 1, 33–35)
D. N. Lehmer proved that a P3 must have at least three distinct prime
factors, a P4 at least four, a P5 at least six, a P6 at least nine, and a P7
at least fourteen.
It is possible to create higher-order perfect numbers from lower-order,
based on this theorem: if p is prime, n is p-perfect and p |/ n, then pn
is ( p + 1)-perfect. For example, if n is 3-perfect and 3 |/ n, then 3n is
4-perfect, and if n is 5-perfect and 5 |/ n, then 5n is 6-perfect.

Pocklington’s theorem
Henry Cabourn Pocklington (1870–1952) was a physicist and a Fel-
low of the Royal Society. His contribution to mathematics was a sin-
gle paper written during the First World War. D. H. Lehmer in 1927
used this paper to produce Pocklington’s test for primality. Whereas
Pépin’s test for the primality of n depends on the complete factor-
ization of n −1, Pocklington’s needs only a partial factorization.
Suppose that we can factorize n −1 into two factors, n −1 = FR
where F and R are coprime and F > R. Then if for every prime factor
q of F there is an integer a > 1 such that,
an −1  1 (mod n),
and also the greatest common divisor of a(n −1)/q −1 and n is equal to
1, then n is prime. (There is no need to use the same value of a for
every factor q.)
Polignac’s conjectures
In 1849, Alphonse de Polignac (1817–1890) conjectured that for
every even number 2k there is an infinity of primes that differ by 2k.
If k = 1 this reduces to the twin primes conjecture. (Dickson 1952,
424) (Polignac 1849)
See Dickson’s conjecture
Polignac or obstinate numbers
Polignac also conjectured that every odd number is the sum of a prime
and power of 2. He claimed to have verified this up to 3,000,000, and
if he did indeed go to these lengths, it was a monumental waste of
effort, for Euler had already noted that 127 and 959 cannot be so. In
Polignac’s conjectures • 175

fact, Erdös proved that there is an infinite arithmetic progression of
odd integers that cannot be represented as sum of a prime and 2n.
The numbers that refute Polignac’s conjecture have been called Polig-
nac numbers or obstinate numbers, of which there are seventeen less
than 1000, only one of which is composite, 905. (Ajax: Caldwell, Prime
Pages) The sequence of failures starts: 127, 149, 251, 331, 337, . . .
Curiously, as Clifford Pickover has noted, there are many pairs of
obstinate numbers differing by 2, such as 905 and 907; 3341 and
3343; 3431 and 3433. Pickover has also calculated the smallest titanic
obstinate number, 10999 + 18919.
If you want to join Pickover in finding obstinate numbers, you can
sign up for the Grand Internet Obstinate Number Search, another
example of distributed computing.
Most Polignac numbers are themselves prime. Cohen and Selfridge
showed that the twenty-six-digit number,
47,867,742,232,066,880,047,611,079
is prime and neither the sum nor the difference of a power of 2 and
a prime.
powerful numbers
If when a positive integer is factorized, all its prime factors appear at
least squared, then it is powerful. The sequence of powerful num-
bers starts
4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100, . . .
Solomon Golomb showed how to find an infinite number of consec-
utive pairs of powerful numbers, such as 8 and 9, 288 and 289, and
proved that the number of powerful numbers ≤x is approximately
cx where c = 2.173 . . . He also conjectured that 6 is not the differ-
ence between two powerful numbers, but this is false:
6 = 5473 −4632
(Narkiewicz: Guy 1994)
It turns out that every integer is the difference between two power-
ful numbers.

yn + 1 = xn + yn.
As a more general rule, if A and B are consecutive powerful num-
bers, then so are 4AB and 4AB + 1. Also, if u and u + 4 are both pow-
erful, then so are u(u + 4) and u(u + 4) + 4 = (u + 2)2.
Almost all known pairs of consecutive powerful numbers have one
of them a perfect square. Golomb gives this exception: 233 = 12167
and 23  32  132 = 12168. (Golomb 1970)
Also, every sufficiently large number is the sum of three powerful
numbers. (Heath-Brown: Guy 1994)
It has been conjectured that there cannot be three consecutive pow-
erful numbers. (Golomb 1970)
The smaller number of each pair of consecutive powerful numbers is
8, 288, 675, 9800, 12167, 235224, . . . (Sloane A060355) 
Mollin and Walsh actually proved a much stronger result: for every
integer n, there is an infinite number of pairs of powerful numbers
whose difference is n. Also, every even integer is the difference in an
infinity of ways of two powerful numbers neither of which is a
square. (Mollin and Walsh 1986)

primality testing
The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite
numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is
primality testing • 177

known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic.
It has engaged the industry and wisdom of ancient and modern
geometers to such an extent that it would be superfluous to dis-
cuss the problem at length. . . . Further, the dignity of the science
itself seems to require that every possible means be explored for
the solution of a problem so elegant and so celebrated.
—Gauss, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801), #329
Gauss went on to claim that with his methods “numbers with seven,
eight, or even more digits have been handled with success and
speed beyond expectation,” though he admitted that “all methods
that have been proposed thus far are either restricted to very special
cases or are so laborious and prolix that . . . these methods do not
apply at all to larger numbers.”
The problems of primality testing and factorization are indeed extra-
ordinarily tricky and subtle. Fortunately, testing for primality is the
easier of the two.
Using powerful electronic computers, the sieve of Erastosthenes is
efficient for numbers up to about 1010, while trial division, dividing a
number n by the primes, starting with 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on up to the
limit of n, works for numbers with up to about twenty-five digits,
and both these methods will produce the factors, if there are any: pri-
mality simply means no proper factors.
To test for primality alone, however, there are more powerful meth-
ods. What is needed is a theorem about prime numbers that can be
turned around to become a test. One candidate is Wilson’s theorem
that if and only if p is prime,
p | ( p −1)! + 1
However, calculating ( p −1)! is extremely expensive even on large
modern computers, so this theorem is more or less useless. A more
promising candidate is Fermat’s Little Theorem, which says if p is
prime and a and p are coprime then,
a p −1  1 (mod p)
Unfortunately, there is a fly in the ointment!—the converse of Fermat’s
Little Theorem is not true. There are pseudoprimes, composite num-
bers, q, for which the theorem is true for certain values of a (and there
178 • primality testing

are even absolute pseudoprimes, or Carmichael numbers, for which it
is true for any value of a). These pseudoprimes are annoying,
although they are relatively rare. For example, there are more than 109
primes less than 25  109 but only 21,853 base 2 pseudoprimes.
So Fermat’s Little Theorem can be used as a test for primality, but
not as a proof. If a number fails Fermat’s Little Theorem, then it must
be composite. But if it passes the test, there remains a (small) prob-
ability that it is not a real prime but only a pseudoprime. Hence a
number that has passed the Fermat’s Little Theorem test, maybe for
several values of a, is called a probable prime, and the numbers a are
its witnesses.
Suppose that you choose an odd number, n, at random so that 1 <
n ≤ x, and a base a at random, 1 < a < n −1, and suppose that 
an −1  1 (mod n) so that n is a pseudoprime to base a. What is the
chance that n is actually composite, as a function of x?
Kim and Pomerance (1989) showed that if x has 60 digits, the
chance is less than 0.0716, small but significant. However, if x has
100 digits, it is less than 0.0000000277, and if x has 1,000 digits, it is
1.6  10−1331. Pseudoprimes are a nuisance, but as the range of x
increases they become less and less significant.
There are several ways to get around these difficulties, leading to
the Lucas-Lehmer test, the special Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne
numbers, Pépin’s test for Fermat numbers, Pocklington’s theorem,
Proth’s theorem, methods based on elliptic curves, not forgetting the
AKS algorithm, and newer and far more powerful algorithms, many
of them probabilistic.
probabilistic methods
Probabilistic primality tests are similar to Fermat’s Little Theorem, in
that they search for witnesses (corresponding to the base in Fermat’s

Titanic Primes
Samuel Yates defined a titanic prime as a prime with at least a thou-
sand digits in 1984 when only 110 such primes had been identified.
A titan, naturally, was anyone who had found a titanic prime. The
name has now been made absurd by advances in computer hard-
ware and programming methods!

theorem) to the compositeness of a number, N. If a witness is found,
the algorithm will stop, and the conclusion is certain that the number
is composite.
So the strategy is to choose some numbers, say, 200 of them, at
random between 1 and N −1 and test if they are witnesses. If they
all are, and the chance of the number not being composite is one-
half for each witness, then you can be confident that N is not prime,
apart from the miniscule probability of 1 in 2200 that you are wrong.
This is certainly close enough to certainty for so-called industrial
grade primes for use in RSA encryption, for example.
For an introduction to more detailed and advanced arguments, an
excellent source is Hugh Williams, Édouard Lucas and Primality
Testing (1998).

Carl Pomerance has proved that for every number n, there are n
points on the prime number graph that are collinear. The illustration
shows the first cases for n = 3, 4, and 5. (Pomerance 1979)
prime number theorem and 
the prime counting function
The questions, “How many primes are there?” and “How big is the
nth prime?” are closely related. If we could answer either of them
exactly with a simple formula, then we could also answer the
other—but we can’t. The best mathematicians have managed is to
get more or less close to the exact answers.
The number of primes less than or equal to n is denoted by π(n).
This shouldn’t be misleading—there is no connection between the π
in π(n) and the constant π that is related to the circle.
Since all primes except 2 and 3 are of the form 6n  1, we can say
that at most one-third of numbers are prime, but this is a gross over-
estimate. Noticing that they are also of the form 30n  1, 7, 11, or 13
means that at most eight out of thirty, or 26.66%, can be prime, but
this is also a feeble figure, not least because the number of primes
decreases the further we go but this proportion stays the same.
The prime number theorem asserts that as n increases, π(n) asymp-
totically approaches n/log n, meaning that π(n) / n/log n tends to 1
as n tends to infinity. In notation: π(n) ∼n/log n. This is a brilliantly
simple estimate, and a pretty good one, though not the best: it also
turned out to be very difficult to prove.
The approximation n/log n to π(n) also means that of the numbers
1 to n, roughly 1/log n are prime. We could also say that the proba-
bility of a random number between 1 and n being prime is approxi-
mately 1/log n.
It also means that the average gap between two consecutive
primes near the number x is close to log x. Thus, when x is round
about 100, log x is approximately 4.6, so roughly every fifth number
should be prime.
history
Legendre was the first to put a version of the prime number theorem
into print. In 1798 he claimed in his book Essai sur la Théorie des
prime number theorem and the prime counting function • 181

Nombres that π(x) is approximately x/(log x −1.08366). He must have
been tempted to conclude that the last figure should be 1 (the best
value), but he stuck with his data, which only went up to 400,000.
The youthful Gauss had also been studying prime numbers, and in
1792 at the age of fifteen he proposed the estimate,
π(x) is approximately Li(x) = 
x
2
dt
Gauss’s conjecture is equivalent to the prime number theorem.
There was then a long pause until Tchebycheff proved in 1851 that
if π(x) / x/log x does have a limit, then the limit must be 1, though
he was unable to take the final step and show that the limit existed.
A year later he proved that if n is large enough, then
< π(x) <
The final step was taken entirely independently by de la Vallée
Poussin (1866–1962) and Jacques Hadamard (1865–1963), coinciden-
tally two of the longest lived mathematicians ever. They proved that,
indeed,
π(x) ∼
The error in this approximation depends on the zero-free region of
the Riemann zeta function inside the critical strip within which the
real part of x is between 0 and 1. The more we know about this
region, the smaller we can make the error term. Koch showed in
1901 that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, then
π(x) = Li(x) + an error term of the order of x 1/2 logx
De la Vallée Poussin also showed that Gauss’s estimate Li(x) is a bet-
ter approximation to π(x) than x/(log x −a) no matter what value is
assigned to the constant a (and also that the best value for a is 1).

Erdös and Atle Selberg found a method of proof that did not use the
Riemann zeta function or the theory of complex numbers, and so is
described as “elementary,” though it is more complicated and harder
to understand than the analytic proofs. Donald Benson recalls that in
1950 he attended a course of thirty lectures devoted entirely to
explaining the new “elementary” proof! (Benson 1999, 231)
record calculations
The record value for π(x) is π(1021) = 21,127,269,486,018,731,928,
calculated by Xavier Gourdon on October 27, 2000. (Caldwell, Prime

by Marc Deleglise and Paul Zimmermann. (Deleglise and Zimmer-
mann 1996)
There are many estimates for the value of π(n). For example, if n >
16, then n/log n < π(n) < n/(log n −3/2) (Williams 1998, 18)
For x > 1,

In this table Gauss’s Li(x) is always larger than π(x). However, in
1914 Littlewood proved that π(x) −Li(x) assumes both positive and
negative values infinitely often. Skewes then proved in 1933, assum-
ing the truth of the Riemann hypothesis, that the first switch occurs
before x reaches 10101034

mathematics,” according to G. H. Hardy, who compared it to the
number of possible games of chess in which every particle in the
universe was a piece.
Today, Skewes’s number is negligible (!) compared to certain num-
bers appearing in conbinatorics, such as Graham’s number, which
can only be expressed using a special notation.
It is also a very poor estimate: in 1986 te Riele showed that be-
tween 6.62  10370 and 6.69  10370 there are more than 10180 consecu-
tive integers for which Li(x) is an underestimate.
A much better approximation than any of these is the Riemann func-
tion, R(x), which is defined using the Möbius function, µ(n), which
is 1 for n = 1, 0 if n is not squarefree, and (−1)k otherwise, where k
is the number of distinct prime factors in n. R(x) is the sum from 1 to
infinity of µ(n)/n Li(x1/n) =

In the 1870s Meissel developed a clever way to calculate π(x) far
beyond the known tables of primes and in 1885 (slightly mis-)cal-
culated π(109). Meissel’s methods were simplified by D. H. Lehmer
in 1959. Further improvements followed, and finally in October 2000
Xavier Gourdon and his distributed computing project calculated
π(1021).
estimating p(n)
The nth prime is denoted by p(n) and is roughly n log n. A recent
estimate is that 0.91n log n < p(n) < 1.7n log n. A better estimate for
p(n) is n(log n + log log n −1), and Pierre Dusart has proved that
this is always an underestimate. (Dusart 1999)

It is of course possible, with sufficient computing power, to calculate
p(n) exactly, though there is no very simple formula.

prime pretender
The title prime pretender to base b is given to any composite num-
ber, n, that satisfies the equation nb  n (mod b). This is a less
restrictive condition that Fermat’s Little Theorem, which says that if b
and n are coprime, then np −1  1 (mod p), and so there are more
exceptions than the pseudoprimes that misleadingly satisfy Fermat’s
Little Theorem.
The title primary pretender for base b is given to the smallest prime
pretender to base b. Since the smallest Carmichael number, 561, sat-
isfies n p −1  1 (mod b) for all bases, and therefore, nb  n (mod b),
every primary pretender is ≤561.

The residues repeat, in the sequence 3-4-2-1, which includes all the
integers less than 5. Therefore, 3 is a primitive root of 5.
In general a primitive root, g, of a prime p is such that the residues
of g, g2, g3, g4, . . . , g p −1 (mod p) are all distinct, which means that
they are a permutation of the numbers 1 to p −1.
It isn’t necessary to actually work out the powers of g: it is enough
to reduce each power (mod p) and then multiply by g. For example,
the first few powers of 5 (mod 13) are:
5 = 5
(mod 13)
52 = 25  12

53  5  12 = 60  8

Since 54  1 (mod 13), the sequence of residues now repeats, and 5
is not a primitive root of 13.
Any odd prime, p, has φ (φ ( p)) = φ ( p −1) primitive roots. So 13
has φ (12) = 4 primitive roots, which are 2, 6, 7, and 11.
Not only primes have primitive roots. A composite integer n has a
primitive root if (and only if) it is 1, 2, or 4 or is of one of the forms
p a or 2p a where p is an odd prime. In this case, it has φ (φ (n)) prim-
itive roots.
primitive roots • 187

We can express this another way: if g φ (m) is the smallest power of
g that is congruent to 1 (mod m), then g is a primitive root of m.
Johann H. Lambert (1728–1777) announced without proof that every
prime number has at least one primitive root.
There is no fast algorithm for finding primitive roots of a general inte-
ger, or even for testing whether a number is a primitive root.

Artin’s conjecture
Artin conjectured in 1927 that if n is neither −1, 0, or 1 nor a perfect
square, then the number of primes for which n is a primitive root is
infinite. This question has not been settled, but it is known that it is
true for n = 2, 3, and 5.
There is also a connection with recurring decimal periods. If p is a
prime greater than 5, then the decimal expansion of 1/p has the max-
imum possible period of p −1 if and only if 10 is a primitive root
modulo p. This was the subject of another famous conjecture by Artin.

Let Qn = ( p1p2 p3 . . . pn)1/pn. Then the limit of Qn as n tends to infin-
ity is e, the base of natural logarithms. (Ruiz 1997)
Proth’s theorem
François Proth (1852–1879) was a farmer and self-taught mathemati-
cian who died at the age of twenty-seven, having spent his entire life
in the village of Vaux-devant-Damloup near Verdun. (Williams 1998,
121) One of the many glories of mathematics is that progress can be
and has been made by the humble and the amateur. This is not to
say that the research “boundary” of mathematics is not usually far
distant from amateur studies—it is—but rather that mathematics is so
rich and so fertile, and there are so many ideas left to discover, that
the amateur on occasion can make a great contribution.
In 1878 he proved Proth’s theorem: if N = k  2n + 1 with 2n > k and
if there is an integer a such that N divides a(N −1)/2 + 1, then N is
prime. This test is extremely simple and covers Fermat numbers,
Cullen numbers, and others.
Proth’s theorem • 189

One of the most popular prime number programs on the Internet is
the Proth.exe program created by Yves Gallot in 1997, originally to
find larger factors of the Fermat numbers that are known to be of the
form k  2n + 1. It now also handles numbers of the form k  2n −1,
and Generalized Fermat numbers of the form b2n + 1. In 1997 Car-
los Rivera used it to find the largest known “non-Mersenne” prime,
9183  2262112 + 1. In 1998, Chip Kerchner found the then largest
known Sophie Germain prime, 92305  216998 + 1.
pseudoperfect numbers
Sierpinski called numbers that are the sum of some of their factors
only, pseudoperfect. For example, 12 = 2 + 4 + 6. If we divide by 12,
we get an example of Egyptian fractions, which sum to unity:
1 = 1⁄6 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄2
Similarly, 20 = 10 + 5 + 4 + 1 and 1 = 1⁄2 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄5 + 1⁄20.
Conversely, any expression of the form 1 = 1⁄a + 1⁄b + 1⁄c + . . . leads to
a pseudoperfect number. This is an example of a set of reciprocals of
odd integers that sum to 1:
1 = 1⁄3 + 1⁄5 + 1⁄7 + 1⁄9 + 1⁄15 + 1⁄21 + 1⁄27 + 1⁄35 + 1⁄63 + 1⁄105 + 1⁄135
(Guy 1981, D11: 89)
It is equivalent to:
945 = 315 + 189 + 135 + 105 + 63 + 45 + 35 + 27 + 15 + 9 + 7

pseudoprimes
The problem with the simple tests that a prime number must pass is
that some composite numbers satisfy them also. In other words, pass-
ing the test is necessary but not sufficient to prove that the number
is prime.
So, for every simple test there are some composite numbers that
pass it. These are called pseudoprimes. The simplest pseudoprimes
are the Fermat pseudoprimes, which satisfy Fermat’s Little Theorem,
190 • pseudoperfect numbers

although they are actually composite. (If the term pseudoprime is
used without qualification a Fermat pseudoprime is meant.)
According to Fermat’s Little Theorem, if p is prime and a and p are
coprime, then
a p −1  1 (mod p)
Unfortunately the converse is not true. Sometimes,
a n −1  1 (mod n)
although n is composite. For example,
2341 −1  1 (mod 341)
although 341 = 11  31.
This is the smallest exception with a = 2 and is therefore the small-
est Fermat pseudoprime to base 2, discovered by Sarus in 1819.
(Base 2 pseudoprimes are occasionally called Sarus numbers; also
Poulet numbers, after Paul Poulet, who published an early table of
pseudoprimes in 1938; and occasionally Fermatians.)
There are also pseudoprimes to other bases: the smallest to base 3
is 91 = 7  13, and to base 5, 217 = 7  31. (If you count even pseudo-
primes, then 124 = 22  31 is the smallest in base 5. Some authors sim-
ply don’t count even numbers as pseudoprimes, since it is so
obvious that they are composite anyway.)
We could have discovered that 341 is composite by checking it using
another base, for example, 3:
3341 −1  56 (mod 341)
So 341 is composite after all. It is a pseudoprime to base 2 but not to
base 3. By checking to see if a number is pseudoprime to various dif-
ferent bases, we can usually discover quite quickly if it is composite.
However, some rare numbers are pseudoprimes to every base. These
are the Carmichael numbers.
The sequence of pseudoprimes to base 2 starts: 341, 561, 645, 1105,
1387, 1729, 1905, 2047, . . . (Sloane A001567) These are all odd. D. H.
Lehmer found the smallest even pseudoprime to base 2 which is
161038 = 2  73  1103, since 2161038  2 (mod 161038).
pseudoprimes • 191

There is an infinity of pseudoprimes to any given base, and an infinity
of pseudoprimes with exactly k factors, provided k > 1. However,
pseudoprimes are much scarcer than genuine primes. There are 78,498
primes less than 1,000,000 but only 245 pseudoprimes to base 2.
bases and pseudoprimes
To which bases is 91 a pseudoprime? It is a pseudoprime to thirty-six
bases, starting with: 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 36,
38, 40, 43, 48, 51, . . . It is no coincidence that φ(91) = 72 = 2  36. The
ratio of φ (n) to the number of bases to which it is a pseudoprime is
1 for prime numbers and Carmichael numbers, and 2, 3, 4, or 5 for
these numbers:

pseudoprimes, strong
Starting with an odd number, n, and a base b, we know that if,
bn −1  1 (mod n)
then either n is prime or it is pseudoprime to base b. Now write n in
the form 2k  m + 1. Then,
b2km
 1 (mod n)
b2km −1  0 (mod n)
So, by factorizing b2km −1
(bm −1)(bm + 1)(b2m + 1)(b4m + 1) . . . (b2(k −1)m + 1)  0 (mod n)
Therefore, n divides one of these factors, if it is prime. If it is com-
posite but divides one of these factors anyway, then it is a strong pseu-
doprime to base b.
192 • pseudoprimes, strong

Testing whether n does indeed divide any of these expressions is a
stronger test than the usual pseudoprime test, because strong
pseudoprimes are extremely rare.
There are just three strong pseudoprimes less than 1,000, and only
forty-six below 1,000,000, compared to 245 ordinary pseudoprimes
to base 2. Moreover, there are no Carmichael numbers among the
strong pseudoprimes. If n is composite, then it will fail the strong
pseudoprime test for at least half the bases less than n.
public key encryption
Substitution ciphers have been found in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in
Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets. They were later used by Julius Cae-
sar, who gave his name to the Caesar Cipher. Leaping forward across
two thousand years, the Second World War was shortened by the suc-
cess of the mathematicians at Bletchley Park, including Alan Turing,
who cracked the codes produced by the German Enigma machine, and
where Colossus, the world’s first electronic computer, was used from
1944 onward. More recently, the British government has announced
the creation of a new institute devoted to “signals intelligence,” or the
study of communications “used by terrorists and criminals.”
Traditional methods of sending secret mesages, although inge-
nious, shared a problem, which was that the sender and the recipi-
ent needed the same key, and exchanging the key was a risky
business because it could too easily be intercepted.
Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 had a bright idea:
instead of having the same key for encryption and decryption, what
about having different keys? Then the encryption key could be
openly published, but anyone with the coded message in their hands
would be helpless to decrypt the message. There would, of course,
have to be some connection between the two keys, but this ought to
be as obscure as possible, except to the decoder. Alternatively, you
might publish the decryption key but hide the encryption method. (It
was later revealed that the British Secret Service had already thought
of the same idea but—force of habit?—kept it secret!)
The original idea that Diffie and Hellman published in the prophet-
ically titled “New Directions in Cryptography” went like this. First,
two numbers are made public, a prime p, and a generator g, which
public key encryption • 193

is chosen so that every number from 1 to p −1 is of the form gn for
some value of n.
Alan and Betty can then create shared secret keys as follows: Alan
chooses his own random number a and calculates ga (mod p), while
Betty chooses her number b and calculates gb (mod p). They then
exchange the results. Alan then calculates (gb)a (mod p) and Betty
calculates (ga)b (mod p). They now share the secret key gab (mod p),
and this will remain secret as long as it is impossible, or simply
impracticable, to calculate gab from ga and gb, should the latter
become public knowledge because they exchanged them over an
insecure channel. This is so provided the prime p is large enough.
The result was a range of public key encryption systems, most of
which turned out not to be as unbreakable as their inventors fondly
imagined: the clear winner in the Darwinian struggle was the RSA
algorithm.
These are not used in practice to encrypt entire messages, because
they are about a thousand times slower than conventional cryptog-
raphy, but they can be used to encrypt the conventional crypto-
graphic key.

Pythagorean triangles, prime
Pythagorean triangles are right-angled triangles with integral sides.
The lengths of the sides can always be represented in the form, 2mn,
m2 −n2, m2 + n2, for some values of m and n.
If hypothesis H of Sierpinski and Schinzel is true, then there is an
infinity of Pythagorean triangles with one leg and the hypotenuse
both prime. Harvey Dubner and Tony Forbes have searched for such
triangles. The largest they found had one leg of 5,357 digits and a
hypotenuse of 10,713 digits. (Dubner and Forbes 2001)
quadratic residues
If we take a prime, p, and square all the integers less than p, we get
a limited number of answers. For example, if p = 11, then

The pattern is (inevitably) symmetrical. The numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, and
9 are the quadratic residues of 11, or the quadratic residues modulo
11. The numbers 2, 6, 7, and 8 are non-residues.
If p is an odd prime, it has ( p −1)/2 quadratic residues and the same
number of non-residues.
The number −1 is a quadratic residue of primes of the form 4n + 1
and a non-residue of primes 4n + 3. It follows that if the prime p =
4n + 1, then there is a multiple of p that is of the form 1 + x2. Simi-
larly, 2 is a quadratic residue of primes of the form 8n  1 and a non-
residue of primes 8n  3.
quadratic residues • 195

Euler’s criterion says that a is a quadratic residue of p if a ( p −1)/2  1
(mod p) and a non-residue if a( p −1)/2  −1 mod p. Notice that it must
be one or the other! So the 5th powers of 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9  1 (mod
11), while 2, 6, 7, 8, and 10  −1 (mod 11).
The product of two residues or two non-residues is a residue, but the
product of a residue and a non-residue is a non-residue—they
behave like positive and negative numbers.
If a  b (mod p), then a and b are either both residues or both non-
residues.
residual curiosities
If N is the maximum number of consecutive non-residues of a prime
p, Hudson proved the conjecture that N < p, if p is large enough.
The only exception seems to be p = 13. (Hudson: Guy 1994)
Issia Schur has conjectured that 13 is the only prime, p, with more
than p consecutive non-residues. Hudson has proved this is so for
p > 2232. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
Quadratic residues often appear in applications of mathematics, for
example in the design of the best reception in concert halls, and in
noise abatement structures. Concert hall acoustics also create prob-
lems of normal modes of vibration in cubical or near-cubical res-
onators, whose solution depends on representing integers as the
sum of three squares. (Schroeder 1992)
polynomial congruences
What about more complicated polynomials than the simple x2?
Lagrange (1736–1813) proved that if p is a prime, then the polyno-
mial congruence,
anx n + an −1x n −1 + . . . + a1x + a0  0 (mod p)
has, at most, n solutions (mod p), provided an is not divisible by p.
For example, x 3 −5x + 3  0 (mod 7) has the single solution x  6
(mod 7), while x 3 −4x + 9 has three solutions (mod 3), which means
that all its values are divisible by 3.

quadratic reciprocity, law of
This law was discovered by Euler in 1772, partly proved by Legendre
in 1785, and rediscovered by Gauss, at the age of eighteen, who
proved it in total of eight different ways, the first in 1796, and called
it the aureum theorema, or golden theorem.
Frank Lemmermeyer published in 2000 a list of 196 different proofs,
but this is already out of date. At www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de there
is a list of 207 proofs, 8 of them in the new millennium, evidence of
the importance, depth, and fascination of this theorem.
It can be most briefly expressed using the Legendre symbol:
(a|q) equals: 
+1 if a is a quadratic residue of p
−1 if a is not a quadratic residue of p
and (n|p) equals:
0 if n  0 (mod p)
Legendre’s function might seem bizarre, but it is actually very useful,
not least because it has several simple properties. For example, if p
is an odd prime, then for any two integers a and a′,
(aa′|p) = (a|p)(a′|p)
(a2|p) = 1
and if a  b (mod p) then (a|p) = (b|p)
• The first property implies that (ar|p) = (a|p)r.
• The first two properties imply that (a2b|p) = (b|p).
The law of quadratic reciprocity states that if p and q are distinct odd
primes, then (q|p) = ( p|q) unless both p and q are of the form 
4n + 3, in which case (q|p) = −( p|q).
Notice that, once again, a subtle but striking difference appears
between numbers of the two forms 4n + 1 and 4n + 3!
The law can also be expressed as ( p|q) = (−1)( p −1)(q −1)/4)(q|p).
It can now be used to calculate values of (a|b). For example, is 152
a quadratic residue modulo 43? Let’s see:
(152|43) = (23|43) = −(43|23) = −(20|23) 
= −(22|23)(5|23) = −(1)(5|23) = −(23|5) = −(3|5) 
= −(5|3) = −(2|3) = −(−1) = 1

Or, alternatively:
(152|43) = (23|43)(19|43) = (2|43)3(19|43) 
= (−1)3(−1)(43|19) = (5|19) = (19|5) = (4|5) = (22|5) = 1
Euler’s criterion
If p is an odd prime, then for all n, (n|p) = n( p −1)/2 (mod p).
It follows that: (−1|p) =
1 if p  1 (mod 4)
(−1|p) = −1 if p  3 (mod 4)
Similarly,
(2|p)
=
1 if p  1 (mod 8)
(2|p)
= −1 if p  3 (mod 8)

Ramanujan, Srinivasa (1887–1920)
An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought
of God.
—Ramanujan (Hoffman 1998, 85)
Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan was born in Erode, a small town in
Tamil Nadu state, India. He was a self-taught mathematician with an
uncanny ability to manipulate formulae reminiscent of Euler. Suffer-
ing from poverty and moving from one petty job to another as 
he pursued his mathematical inspirations, he eventually wrote to 
one mathematician in England—no response—then another—no
response—and then finally to G. H. Hardy, who recognized his
genius, explaining that his theorems “must be true, because, if they
were not true, no one would have had the imagination to invent
them.” (Hardy 1940, 9) Hardy arranged for him to come to Cam-
bridge, persuading Madras University to grant him a research schol-
arship of £250 a year for five years plus £100 for his passage to
England in 1914.
Hardy had a very high opinion of Ramanujan, at least in terms of
pure “natural” talent, for which he rated him at 100, giving himself
25, his longtime collaborator Littlewood 30, and the great German,
David Hilbert, 80. (Hardy’s judgment of himself is suspect, not to say
bizarre: he had a pessimistic streak in his makeup, which came out
198 • Ramanujan, Srinivasa (1887–1920)

in his famous work, A Mathematician’s Apology, which was indeed
“apologetic,” as if his wonderful life’s work needed any excuse. On
one occasion he tried to kill himself, as did indeed Ramanujan. For-
tunately, they both failed.)
Ramanujan produced, with Hardy, some remarkable mathemat-
ics, and left behind him his extraordinary notebooks, which have
since been transcribed and published and continue to be studied,
but the English climate and food did not agree with him. He con-
tracted tuberculosis, and returned to India in 1918, to die two years
later.
Ramanujan had his own view of his talents: “Ramanujan and his
family were ardent devotees of God Narasimha (the lion-faced
incarnation of God), the sign of whose grace consisted in drops of
blood seen during dreams. Ramanujan stated that after seeing such
drops, scrolls containing the most complicated mathematics used to
unfold before him and that after waking, he could set down on
paper only a fraction of what was shown to him.” (Ranganathan
1967, 88)
Ramanujan had a truly wonderful gift for manipulating formulae of
all kinds. For example, from the fact that,
1/22 + 1/32 + 1/42 + 1/52 + . . . = π 2/6
he deduced that,
1/22 + 1/32 + 1/52 + 1/72 + 1/82 + 1/112 + 1/122 + . . . = π 2/20
where the denominators are the integers with an odd number of
prime divisors. Similarly,
1/22 + 1/32 + 1/52 + 1/72 + 1/112 + 1/132 + 1/172 + . . . = 9/2π 2
where the denominators are the integers containing an odd number
of dissimilar prime divisors. (Ramanujan 1913)
highly composite numbers
One of Ramanujan’s longest and best papers was on highly composite
numbers, which he defined as a number whose “number of divisors ex-
ceeds that of all its predecessors.” He proved that if 2a  3b  5c  7d  . . .
pz is highly composite, then a ≥b ≥c ≥d . . . ≥z and that z = 1, for all
highly composite numbers except 4 and 36. (Ramanujan 1915)
Ramanujan, Srinivasa (1887–1920) • 199

He also proved that the ratio of very large consecutive highly com-
posite numbers tends to 1 and gave a list of 103 highly composite
numbers, which starts:
2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, . . .
There are just six highly composite numbers, if 1 is included, that are
divisors of every larger highly composite number: (1), 2, 6, 12, 60,
and 2520. (Steven Ratering 1991)
It is possible to find a sequence of consecutive integers, as long as
we choose, whose members are all highly composite. (Subrakamian
and Becker 1966)
randomness, of primes
To put it poetically, primes play a game of chance.
—Mark Kac (1959)
It is evident that the primes are randomly distributed but, unfor-
tunately we don’t know what “random” means.
—R. C. Vaughan (Chance News 11.02)
The prime numbers are so irregular that is tempting to think of them
as some kind of random sequence, in which case it should be possi-
ble to use the theory of probability and statistics to study them. The
first and most famous application of probability to primes was the
Erdös-Kac theorem.
In 1917 Hardy and Ramanujan had proved that provided N is large,
the “typical” number of prime factors is log log N. (A very small pro-
portion of numbers has many small prime factors, but such numbers
are untypical.) The normal law states, very roughly, that many dis-
tributions in nature behave as if they were the result of tossing a coin
many times. Poincare claimed that there is something mysterious
about the normal law because mathematicians think it is a law of
nature but physicists believe it is a mathematical theorem. (Kac 1959)
Mark Kac, a pioneer in probability theory, fortunately collabo-
rated with Paul Erdös, who was an expert in analytic number the-
200 • randomness, of primes

ory, to prove that it makes sense to think of the number of distinct
prime factors of N, if N is large, as the sum of statistically indepen-
dent functions N( p), which are 1 if p | N and 0 if p |/ N. It follows
that the number of prime factors of N fits the normal law, with a
mean of log log N and a standard deviation of (log lo
g n)
. (Erdös
and Kac 1945)
More precisely, Kac and Erdös proved that the proportion of inte-
gers for which
log log n + a2 log l
og n
 < d(n) < log log n + b2 log l
og n

equals the area under the “normal” curve,
e−x2 between x = a and x = b.
So, for example, the average number of prime factors is five round
about 1070, and more precisely, about 60% of the integers round
about 1070 have between three and seven prime factors. Similar
results can be proved for other functions, such as Euler’s φ (n) or
totient function.
Three physicists at Boston University, Pradeep Kumar, Plamen
Ivanov, and Eugene Stanley, have been studying heartbeat rhythms.
Now they believe they may have found a curious kind of order in the
sequence of prime numbers. They studied the second differences in
the sequence of primes:

If the primes really jump around randomly, then these second differ-
ences should jump randomly also, but Kumar and his colleagues
concluded that they don’t. Positive values are usually followed by
(corresponding) negative values, for example, the first +2, −2 differ-
ences. They found an oscillation of period 3.
They also decided that second differences that are multiples of 6
are less frequent than other differences. This fits previous statistical
analyses that found oscillations with period 6 in the distances
between consecutive primes. (Kumar, Ivanov, and Stanley 2003)
Patrick Billingsley has explained how we can also think of a single
composite number as generating a random walk. You take the

primes, 2, 3, 5, . . . and move up one step if the prime is a factor of
the number and down one step if it is not. The result is rather like
repeated coin-tossing or Brownian motion—and by adjusting the
size of the steps taken can be made more so. It is then possible to
deduce theorems about prime numbers from well-known results in
probability theory. (Billingsley 1973)
Von Sternach and a prime random walk
The reciprocal of the Riemann zeta function, 1⁄ζ(s), can be written as
this series,
1/ζ(s) = 1 −1/2s −1/3s + 0/4s −1/5s + 1/6s −1/7s + 0/8s
+ 0/9s + 1/10s . . .
The numerators are the values of the Möbius function, µ(n), which is
zero if n is not squarefree, 1 if it has an even number of prime fac-
tors, and −1 if it has an odd number of prime factors.
Von Sternach in 1896 realized that the values of the Möbius func-
tion,
+1, −1, −1, 0, −1, +1, −1, 0, 0, +1, −1, 0, −1, +1, +1, 0, −1, 0, −1 . . .
could be thought of as a random walk in which a drunk either stands
where he is (0), or staggers forward one step (+1), or stumbles back

Kac and Erdös Collaborate
“Erdös, who was spending the year at the Institute of Advanced
Study, was in the audience but he half-dozed through most of my
lecture; the subject matter was too far removed from his interests.
Toward the end I described briefly my difficulties with the number of
prime divisors. At the mention of number theory Erdös perked up
and asked me to explain once again what the difficulty was. Within
the next few minutes, even before the lecture was over, he inter-
rupted to announce that he had the solution!
“The reader, I hope, will forgive my lack of modesty if I say that it
is a beautiful theorem. It marked the entry of the normal law, hith-
erto the property of gamblers, statisticians and observateurs, into
number theory and . . . it gave birth to a new branch of this ancient
discipline.” (Kac 1987, 90–91)

one step (−1). So he listed the first 150,000 values of µ(n) and cal-
culated that the probability that it was non-zero was, apparently,
6/π 2, or roughly 0.608 with +1 and −1 appearing as values more or
less equally often.
The Riemann hypothesis is now equivalent to saying (roughly and
crudely!) that our random walker does not stagger too far from the
origin. (Vaughan, Chance News 11.02)
record primes
A small community of mathematicians is devoted to finding larger,
higher, bigger prime number records. What’s the point? Well, com-
petition is one answer, competition that is fun, that tests even mod-
ern powerful computers to their limits, and that has even become a
sociable activity with the arrival of distributed computing in which
the participants in projects such as GIMPS, the Great Internet
Mersenne Prime Search, work in teams.
Finding the largest primes also depends not only on more power-
ful hardware but on more and more efficient algorithms that are
beautiful in themselves: what could be more astonishing than prov-
ing beyond doubt that a number so large that it could not be written
out by hand in less than millions of years is in fact prime?
some records
The largest known prime was found by GIMPS member Josh Findley,
who used a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 Windows XP PC running for four-
teen days to finally prove the number prime, on May 15, 2004. It is
224036583 −1 and has 7,235,733 decimal digits, nearly a million more
than the previous record. GIMPS project leaders now see the first
ten-million-digit prime within reach, for which the Electronic Fron-
tier Foundation is offering a $100,000 award.
The two previous records were:
• Michael Schafer, a chemical engineering student at Michigan
State University, and GIMPS: 220996011 −1 (6,320,430 digits),
November 17, 2003.
• Michael Cameron, 213466917 −1 (4,053,946 digits), November 14,
2001.

The non-Mersenne prime record is by Jeffrey Young: 3  2303093 + 1
(91,241 digits), found in 1998.
The record for a prime that is not of a special and easily tested
form is 109999 + 33603 (10,000 digits), found using ECPP on August
19, 2003, by Jens Franke, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Tobias Wirth with
a distributed version of their own ECPP program (www.ellipsa.

Chris Caldwell speculates, based on the dates of previous record-
breaking primes, that a 10,000,000-digit prime will be found by 2005,
a 100,000,000-digit prime by 2015, and a 1,000,000,000-digit prime by
early 2025. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)

repunits, prime
The repunits, in base 10, are the numbers whose digits are all 1s,
such as R5 = 11111. Since R5 = 99999/9 = (105 −1)/9, the primality of
Rn depends on the factorization of 10n −1.
A repunit Rn can only be a prime if n itself is a prime. It is believed
that there are infinitely many repunit primes, but only five are
known: R2, R19, R23, and R317, which was proved prime by J. Brillhart
and H. C. Williams in 1977, and R1031, proved prime by Williams and
Dubner in 1986.

A Point of Priority
“Hurwitz knew about M4423 seconds before M4253 (because of the way
the output was stacked). John Selfridge asked ‘Does a machine result
need to be observed by a human before it can be said to be “dis-
covered”?’ To which Hurwitz replied, ‘forgetting about whether the
computer knew, what if the computer operator who piled up the
output looked?’ I [have] decided that Hurwitz discovered the prime
when he read the output, so M4253 was never the largest known
prime.” (Caldwell, Prime Pages)

The two largest known candidate repunit primes are both proba-
ble primes: R49081 = (1049081 −1)/9 was found by Harvey Dubner on
September 9, 1999, and R86453 was discovered by Lew Baxter in Octo-
ber 2000.
In base a, the repunits are of the form (an −1)/(a −1). A repunit in
base 10 will therefore not be a repunit in another base unless we can
solve the equation,
111 . . . 110 = 1 + a + a2 + . . . + an
This has no known solution. However, the equation,
1 + 5 + 52 = 31 = 1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + 24
means that (53 −1)(5 −1) = (25 −1)(2 −1), the only known example
of equal repunits to different bases.
In base 3, the repunits for n ≤1000 are prime for n = 3, 7, 13, 71, 103,
and 541.
In base 5, the repunits for n ≤1000 are prime for n = 3, 7, 11, 13, 47,
127, 149, 181, 619, and 929. (Ribenboim 1988, 279)

Riemann hypothesis
His style was conceptual rather than algorithmic—and to a higher
degree than that if any mathematician before him. He never tried
to conceal his thoughts in a thicket of formulas. After more than
a century his papers are still so modern that any mathematician
can read them without historical comment, and with intense plea-
sure.
—Freudenthal (1975)
Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) was another prod-
igy. When still a youth, he was lent a copy of Legendre’s Treatise on
the Theory of Numbers and read the 900 pages in six days. He stud-
ied under Dirichlet, but presented to Gauss his thesis for a higher
degree, On the Hypotheses Which Lie at the Bases of Geometry. It was
read on June 10, 1854, less than a year before Gauss’s death.
In 1862 Riemann married Elise Koch, but in the same year he
caught a heavy cold and was then diagnosed with tuberculosis. His
health had never been robust, and despite traveling to Italy in search
of a cure, he died of the disease at the age of thirty-nine, leaving
behind a few papers of the very highest quality.
In 1859 Riemann presented to the Berlin Academy the only paper he
ever wrote on number theory, “On the Number of Prime Numbers
Less Than a Given Quantity.” This eight-page paper, obscure, con-
densed, and lacking in rigor by modern standards, contained a num-
206 • Rhonda numbers

ber of conjectures, none of which were proved in the next thirty
years, but which provided ideas and problems for many of the great-
est mathematicians who followed him.
In particular he discussed what is now called the Riemann zeta func-
tion:
ζ(s) = 1/1s + 1/2s + 1/3s + 1/4s + 1/5s + . . .
which is the same as the series that Euler considered (page 72),
except that for Riemann, s was a complex number, whereas for Euler
it was real.
The Riemann zeta function has what are called the trivial zeros at
−2, −4, −6, . . . The remaining zeros are all in the strip for which the
real part of s lies between 0 and 1 inclusive and they are symmetri-
cal about the line real s = 1⁄2.
Riemann conjectured that this function has an infinite number of
zeros with real part between 0 and 1, inclusive, and gave a formula,
also conjectural, for the number of zeros of the function, and then
remarked that all the non-trivial zeros have real part 1⁄2. This is the
famous Riemann hypothesis—Riemann thought it “very likely”—
which is universally regarded as the most important unsolved prob-
lem in mathematics.
The study of the distribution of the zeros of ζ(s) is important because
the size of the error term in the prime number theorem depends on
it. The more that is known about the zero-free region of ζ(s), the
smaller the error term. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to 
π(x) = Li(x) plus an error term that is bounded as x tends to infinity
by a function x1/2 + e.
J. P. Gram in 1903 published a list of the first ten roots plus five
larger roots. The first ten roots all have real part 1⁄2, and are approxi-
mately 1⁄2 + ia, where a has the values:
14.135
21.022
25.011
30.425
32.935
37.586
40.919
43.327
48.005
49.774
(Edwards 1974, 96)
G. H. Hardy proved in 1915 that there is an infinity of zeros on the
critical line, and Conrey in 1989 that more than 40% of the zeros are
on the line.
Riemann hypothesis • 207

Bohr and Landau (1914) proved that for any e > 0, all but an infin-
itesimal proportion of roots lies within e of the line real s = 1⁄2.
Rosser, Yohe, and Schoenfeld have calculated up to the 31⁄2 mil-
lionth zero—and they are all on real s = 1⁄2. The calculations, which
are assumed to be error-free, are on three reels of magnetic tape
stored at the Mathematics Research Center in Madison, Wisconsin.
More recently, A. M. Odlyzko and A. Schönhage used a faster
method of calculation to calculate 106 roots near root number 1020
and 10 billion roots near root number 1022. (Odlyzko and Schönhage
1988)
One way to follow the behavior of ζ(s) is to study a different func-
tion, Z(t) = e i θ (t)ζ(1⁄2 + it), which has real values but also has the same
zeros as ζ(s). (The meaning of e iθ (t) we shall not explain.)
The values of Z(t) can be calculated using the Riemann-Siegel for-
mula that was published by Siegel after he had made a careful study
of Riemann’s unpublished notes.
What does Z(t) look like? Since it is intimately connected to ζ(s),
which is intimately connected to the prime numbers, we might
expect it to be very irregular, and, sure enough, it is! In particular, it

ZetaGrid
“ZetaGrid is a platform independent grid system that uses idle CPU
cycles from participating computers. Grid computing can be used for
any CPU intensive application which can be split into many separate
steps and which would require very long computation times on a single
computer. ZetaGrid can be run as a low-priority background process on
various platforms like Windows, Linux, AIX, Solaris, and Mac OSX. On
Windows systems it may also be run in screen saver mode. . . .
“At the IBM Development Laboratory in Böblingen ZetaGrid solves
one problem in practice, running on six different platforms: The ver-
ification of Riemann’s Hypothesis is considered to be one of modern
mathematics’ most important problems.
“This implementation involves more than 11,000 workstations
and has a peak performance rate of about 7056 GFLOPS. More than
1 billion zeros for the zeta function are calculated every day.” (www
.zetagrid.net/zeta)

occasionally almost fails to cross the x-axis, which is extremely sig-
nificant because a maximum just below the axis or a minimum just
above would mean that Riemann’s hypothesis is false! These events
are referred to as Lehmer’s phenomenon and are illustrated in the
figure on this page. (Lehmer 1956)
How the gods are laughing at us! The point where the graph seems
to touch the axis is actually a pair of zeros that is extremely close
together: just as we have caught our breath, Z(t) executes an enor-
mous swing down and then up again! No wonder that Harold
Edwards remarked, “The degree of irregularity of Z shown by this
graph of Lehmer, and especially the low maximum value [illustrated]
must give pause to even the most convinced believer in the Riemann
hypothesis.” (Edwards 1974, 178) (If you want to observe the behav-
ior of Z(t) yourself, go to www.math.ubc.ca/~pugh/RiemannZeta/
RiemannZetaLong.html, where there is a Java applet that plots Z(t) in
real time.)
the Farey sequence and the Riemann hypothesis
John Farey (1766–1826) published about sixty scientific articles and
just one on mathematics, “On a curious property of vulgar fractions”
(Philosophical Magazine, 1816), in which he pointed out the “curi-

you arrange all the fractions with denominators (for example) at
most five, in order of size, like this,

then they have the neat property that if p⁄q and r⁄s are successive terms,
then qr −ps = 1.
Franel and Landau proved in 1924 that there is a connection with
the Riemann hypothesis. There are ten terms in this Farey sequence
that we can compare with the sequence of equally spaced fractions
from 1⁄10 to 10⁄10:

Calculate the absolute differences: |1⁄5 −1⁄10| = 1⁄10; |1⁄4 −2⁄10| = 1⁄20 . . .
|4⁄5 −9⁄10| = 1⁄10 and |1 −10⁄10| = 0.
Now add up these absolute differences and call the sum S. Then
the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that S/x (1/2 + e)
tends to zero as x tends to infinity whatever the value of e. (Edwards
1974, 264)
the Riemann hypothesis and s(n), 
the sum of divisors function
Let Hn = 1 + 1⁄2 + 1⁄3 + 1⁄4 + . . . + 1⁄n. Then the Riemann hypothesis is
equivalent to the claim that
σ(n) ≤Hn + eH(n) log(Hn)
for all n ≥1, which in turn is 
equivalent to the claim that:
σ(n) < eγn log log n
for all n ≥5041
(Lagarias 2002)
squarefree and blue and red numbers
The Riemann hypothesis can also be expressed in terms of the
squarefree numbers. Call a number red if it is the product of an even
number of distinct primes, and blue if it is the product of an odd
number.
Of the squarefree numbers up to 30, there are eight red numbers,
1, 6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 26, and eleven blue numbers. The Rie-
mann hypothesis says, very roughly, that the numbers of blue and
210 • Riemann hypothesis

red squarefree numbers are about the same. More precisely, the Rie-
mann hypothesis is equivalent to this theorem:
Choose a value of e > 0, which can be as small as you like. Then there is a
number N such that for all n > N, the number of blue numbers from 1 to n
inclusive does not differ from the number of red numbers in the same
range by more than n1/2 + e. (The smaller the value of e, the larger N will be.)
(Wilf 1987)
Denjoy pointed out that if a squarefree number can be regarded as
being equally likely to be blue or red, so that “choosing” its color is
like flipping a coin and getting heads or tails, then according to stan-
dard statistical theory, if you “toss the coin” n times then the differ-
ence between the number of heads and tails as n tends to infinity
will grow less rapidly than n1/2 + e, with probability 1. (Edwards 1974,
268)
Unfortunately, this is only a heuristic argument: we could turn it
around and say that—okay!—it follows that if the Riemann hypothe-
sis is true, then whether a squarefree number is blue or red is indeed
like flipping a coin! Nevertheless, since the latter seems intuitively
likely, we can say that our intuitive feeling that the Riemann hypoth-
esis is correct is strengthened. Mathematics is by no means only
about logic!
the Mertens conjecture
In 1897 Franz Mertens (1840–1927) conjectured that for every n ≥1,
the difference between the number of red and blue numbers (in the
same setup) in the range 1 to n never exceeds n.
In other words, he supposed that we could take e = 0 and N = 1.
This is a much stronger conjecture that was proved false by Odlyzko
and te Riele in 1985.
Riemann hypothesis curiosities
Nicolas proved a theorem in 1983 about the values of φ (n) by first
assuming that the Riemann hypothesis is true, and then assuming
that it is false—so whatever the final conclusion, his result will be
sound!
Although there is much that mathematicians don’t know about the
zeros of the zeta function, they do know enough to calculate the sum
of all their reciprocals, which is, 1⁄2γ + 1 −log 2 −

The RSA algorithm is the best known method of public key encryp-
tion, in which the encryption and decryption keys are different.
There has to be a connection between the two keys, of course, oth-
erwise they could not work together, but provided this connection
cannot be discovered by the fastest available computers in a “rea-
sonable” time, the system is effectively secure. “RSA” is an acronym
for Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who created
the algorithm in August 1977. More recently, documents released by
GCHQ, the British Government Communications Headquarters, in
Britain show that the method was first invented at GCHQ in 1973 by
Clifford Cocks, but they did nothing with it. Adleman, Rivest, and
212 • Riesel number

Shamir were less laid-back. They patented the method and formed
RSA Data Security Inc. to exploit it commercially.
The simplest “very difficult” problem in number theory is factoriz-
ing a large number, so it is no surprise that the RSA method depends
on having two large primes, p and q, whose product, n = pq, can

Adleman originated the term “computer virus” to describe a self-
replicating program that could infect a computer. His student Fred
Cohen released the first computer virus in 1983, within a small net-
work.
Also in 1983, Adleman created with Carl Pomerance and R. S.
Rumely the APR primality test.
More recently, at Christmas 1993, Adleman created the first DNA
computer. It consisted of twenty-one test tubes of DNA, and he used
it to solve a particular case of the Traveling Salesman problem, for
which there is no polynomial-time algorithm. (The Traveling Sales-
man problem asks for the shortest route to visit N towns.)
This is part of Thomas Bass’s account of those days:
Rivest and Shamir kept popping off ideas for how to implement a public-
key crypto system, and Adleman found the holes. Over the next few
months, he cracked 42 potential systems. . . . One night, Adleman was
awakened by a phone call. It was Rivest with public-key crypto system
Number 43. . . . “I knew he’d come up with an unbeatable system,” says
Adleman. “You get a feel for these things if you think about them long
enough; my aesthetic judgment told me he’d finally done it.”
Rivest stayed up all night drafting a research paper, which he presented
to his colleagues the following morning. Published in the February 1978
Communications of the ACM under the joint authorship of Rivest, Shamir,
and Adleman, the paper was officially titled “A Method for Obtaining 
Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems.” . . . Then, the National
Security Agency got in touch. The spies were calling to say that the 
US government classifies cryptography as a munition, and that if they
mailed their article overseas, they would be prosecuted for illegal arms
dealing. . . .
Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman later decided to go into the crypto busi-
ness. . . . So, how did Adleman shape up as a businessman? He throws back
his head and laughs. “In my hands the business went into the toilet,” he
says. “I was terrible. Just awful. We eventually reorganized the company
and hired a real president.” (Bass 1995)

safely be made public because n is impossible to factorize with cur-
rent methods. In 1977 a prime of 100 digits would do. As of today, p
and q can safely be of about 200 digits each.
It also depends on Fermat’s Little Theorem, as improved by Euler.
This says that if a and n are coprime, then,
aw(n)  1 (mod n)
where φ (n) is Euler’s totient function, which in this case, because p
and q are distinct primes, equals ( p −1)(q −1). Having chosen p and
q, we next calculate, using standard techniques, two integers, d and
e, such that 1 < d, e < φ(n) and
de  1 (mod φ (n))
The message we wish to send is then enciphered as a number, M,
which must be less than n: in practice, the asymmetric RSA system is
very slow at encrypting long messages, so they are encrypted by a
standard symmetric method and only the symmetric key is encrypted
by using the RSA algorithm. The message sent is now, M e (mod n),
using the number e that is made public. The numbers n and e are the
public key.
The receiver, who has the private value d, deciphers it by calculat-
ing (M e) d (mod n), since M ed  M (mod n), by Euler’s version of Fer-
mat’s Little Theorem, and M is less than n.
A cryptanalyst in order to crack the cipher must be able to find M e
given only the values of n and e. This is known as the RSA problem.
Although no one has ever proved it, it is widely believed to be equiv-
alent to the factoring problem. If the cryptanalyst can factor n, the
cipher can be cracked, otherwise not, and this cannot currently be
done in polynomial time.
Martin Gardner’s challenge
The RSA system received a burst of publicity in 1977 when the
authors published a public key message and offered a modest $100
reward (plus vast kudos) for any crypto-nut who could crack it and
Martin Gardner advertised the offer in his Scientific American “Math-
ematical Games” column (Gardner 1977) under the provocative title,
“A New Kind of Cipher That Would Take Millions of Years to Break.”
It didn’t, of course, but the 129-digit number known as RSA-129, with
the public encryption key = 9007, was not solved until April 26, 1994,
by a team led by Arjen Lenstra, who used the Internet, 1,600 assorted
computers, and a novel factorization algorithm called the quadratic

sieve, for eight months. The message read, “The magic words are
squeamish ossifrage.”

lenge to “encourage research into large-number factorization and
computational number theory.”
Eight challenge numbers are posted on the Internet. Each number
is a semiprime, as used in RSA encryption.
There are prizes for successful factorization, from $10,000 for the
smallest 576-bit number to $200,000 for 2048 bits. (If you think you
can meet the challenge, you can submit your factorization to RSA
Laboratories online for confirmation.)
These are the first two and the last of the current eight challenges.
The numbers are designated “RSA-XXXX,” where XXXX is the num-
ber’s length, in bits. The first has already been factored:

These data mean that a 512-bit key with 155 decimal digits (which is
still used commercially) can be factored in a few hours. Needless to
say, improvements in factoring algorithms or in machine hardware
could possibly bring larger keys within feasible reach, such as the lat-
est American plans for a superfast computer performing 250 trillion
calculations per second.
RSA Laboratories also publishes a Secret-Key Challenge aimed at
the U.S. government’s data encryption standard (DES), which uses
only 56-bit keys. The idea is to use brute force to check all possible
keys, from the simplest challenge, a 40-bit key, to the hardest, of 128
bits.
In January 1999, Distributed.net won an RSA Labs contest to 
crack a message coded using the DES. They took just twenty-four
hours using the free time of 100,000 computers worldwide, which
tested over 250 billion keys every second. (RSA Laboratories, www.

Ruth-Aaron numbers
Hank Aaron hit his 715th Major League home run on April 8, 1974,
beating the record of 714 held by Babe Ruth. Carl Pomerance, inven-
tor of the quadratic sieve factorization method, and two colleagues
noticed that the pair 714 and 715 have some curious and interesting
properties.
The number 714 = 2 × 3 × 7 × 17, and 715 = 5 × 11 × 13; so 714 ×
715 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17, the product of the first seven
primes, or 7 primorial.
They then discovered on a computer that only primorials 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 7 can be represented as the product of consecutive numbers, up
to primorial 3049.
216 • Ruth-Aaron numbers

They also noticed that σ(714) = 1728 = 123, while the ratio
σ(714)/φ (714) = 1728/192 = 9, a perfect square.
We will add these additional properties:
• 2 + 3 + 7 + 17 = 5 + 11 + 13 = 29, and this is the only way to
split the first seven primes into two sets of equal total.
• φ (φ (715) = φ (480) = 128, which is double φ (φ (714) = φ (192)
= 64.
(Nelson, Penney, and Pomerance 1974)
Scherk’s conjecture
H. F. Scherk conjectured on the basis of empirical evidence that the
nth prime, if n is even, can be represented by the addition and sub-
traction of all the smaller primes, each taken once. For example, 13
is the 6th prime, and
13 = 1 + 2 −3 −5 + 7 + 11
Similarly, the nth prime, when n is odd, can be represented under
the same conditions, except that the immediately smaller prime is
doubled:
17 = 1 + 2 −3 −5 + 7 −11 + 2  13
The conjecture was proved in 1967 by J. L. Brown.
Chris Nash has proved that every integer N (greater than 17) is an
algebraic sum of all the primes less than N, or all the primes less than
N except for the last. (Nash 2000)
Both Brown and Nash used Bertrand’s postulate.
semiprimes
A semiprime (or semi-prime) or 2-almost-prime has just two prime
factors. The sequence starts, 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25 26 33 34 35
38 39 46 49 51 55, . . . (Sloane A001358)
• There are 299 semiprimes less than 1000.
• All semiprimes are deficient, except for 6, which is perfect.
semiprimes • 217

Note that all the semiprimes from 9 to 39 form pairs or triplets of con-
secutive semiprimes. The next such pairs are 57-58, 85-86-87, 93-94-
95, 118-119, 122-123, 133-134, 141-142-143, 145-146.
If the prime factors are required to be distinct, then the first consec-
utive pair is 14 and 15; the first consecutive pair with three distinct
prime factors each is 230 = 2  5  23 and 231 = 3  7  11.
Four consecutive semiprimes cannot exist, because one of them
would be divisible by 4 and have at least three factors.
J. R. Chen proved that every even number is the difference between
a prime and a semiprime.
sexy primes
Sexy primes are such that n and n + 6 are both prime. (“Sexy” comes
from the Latin for “six,” which as all schoolboys know, is sex.) The sexy
pairs under 200 are: 5-11, 11-17, 13-19, 17-23, 23-29, 31-37, 37-43, 47-
53, 53-59, 61-67, 67-73, 73-79, 83-89, 97-103, 103-109, 107-113, 131-137,
151-157, 157-163, 167-173, 173-179, and 191-197. (Sloane A023201)
There are ten of the form 6n + 1 and twelve of the form 6n −1.
The sequence of sexy triplets starts: 7-13-19, 17-23-29, 31-37-43, 47-
53-59, . . . (Sloane A046118)
The sexy quadruplets are: (5-11-17-23), 11-17-23-29, 41-47-53-59, 61-
67-73-79, . . . (Sloane A023271) The first quadruplet is in parentheses
because it is the only one that does not start with a unit digit 1.
The sexy quintuplet, 5-11-17-23-29, is unique since one of the num-
bers must be divisible by 5. There is, ironically, no sexy sextuplet.

Shank’s conjecture
The gap between succesive primes pn and pn + 1 is taken to be pn + 1 −
pn −1, so that the gap between 7 and 11 is 3, corresponding to the
218 • sexy primes

composites 8, 9, and 10. Shank’s conjecture is that if p(g) is the first
prime that follows a gap of size g, then log p(g) is roughly g.
Siamese primes
Named by Beauregard and Suryanarayan, they are prime pairs of the
form n2 −2 and n2 + 2. The sequence of pairs starts, 7-11, 79-83, 223-
227, 439-443, 1087-1091, 13687-13691, . . . (Beauregard and Surya-
narayan 2001)
Sierpinski numbers
Named after Waclav Sierpinski (1882–1969), a Sierpinski number is
an integer k such that k  2n + 1 is composite for any integer value of
n. Sierpinski proved in 1960 that they exist. In 1962, John Selfridge
discovered the smallest known Sierpinski number, 78557. Whatever
the value of n, 78557  2n + 1 is divisible by one of the primes 3, 5,
7, 13, 19, 37, or 73.
The next largest is 271129. However, there are several “probable
Sierpinski numbers,” including 4847, which produces composite
numbers up to n = 279700. (Rivera, Problem 30)
Sierpinski strings
Sierpinski proved that if you take any string of decimal digits, such
1449487, then there are infinitely many prime numbers starting with
this string. There is also an infinity of prime numbers ending with
any given string, provided the last digit is 1, 3, 7, or 9.
This is also true of any arithmetic progress, an + b, provided a and
b are coprime.
Sierpinski’s quadratic
Sierpinski proved in 1964 that for every positive integer k, there is an
integer b such that n2 + b is prime for at least k values of n.
Sierpinski’s f (n) conjecture
Sierpinski conjectured that for every integer k ≥2, there is a number
m for which φ (n) = m has exactly k solutions. This was proved by
Kevin Ford in 1999. (Ford 1999)

Sloane’s On-Line Encyclopedia 
of Integer Sequences
There have been tables of assorted numbers, including the primes,
for centuries, but, as Neil Sloane points out, until the publication of
his book A Handbook of Integer Sequences in 1973, there was no way
to find out whether a particular sequence of integers was well
known and, if so, what it represented.
That book was so popular that a second, enlarged edition, The
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, appeared in 1995, in which
Sloane and Simon Plouffe described nearly 6,000 examples. Now the
On-Line Encyclopedia (www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences) has
more than 93,000 sequences, many contributed by Sloane’s several
hundred correspondents. Each entry contains the leading terms of
the sequence, keywords, mathematical motivations, literature links,
and more.
The great feature of the books and the On-Line Encyclopedia is
that they are arranged in “numerical” order. Online you can simply
enter the first few terms of a sequence to locate it—if it is recognized!
(You can also check by keyword, which is also invaluable.)
Readers will recognize sequence A000040, which is the prime num-
bers. This entry gives a definition and then lists twenty-two refer-
ences to papers and books and nearly fifty links to other sites, as well
as eighteen other related Sloane encyclopedia sequences.
However, if you type in the sequence of integers, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,
17, 19, 23, and expect to get only the answer “The prime numbers,”
you will be greatly mistaken. Several other sequences start the same
way, only to diverge sooner or later—sometimes much later. Some
examples:
• A005180 starts the same, but is “The order of the simple
groups.”
• A008578 includes an initial 1, and is “The prime numbers at
the beginning of the 20th century (today 1 is no longer
regarded as a prime).”
• A030059 is the “Product of an odd number of distinct primes.”
• A015919 is “Numbers n such that n | 2n −2,” so it includes all
the primes plus the pseudoprimes to base 2, starting with the
smallest, 341.
220 • Sloane’s On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

• A038179 is more mysterious. It starts 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,
23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 55, 59, 61, . . . and is
the “Result of second stage of sieve of Eratosthenes.” This
entry is followed by the results of the third and fourth stages.
• The next, A049551, is “Primes p such that x19 = 2 has a solu-
tion mod p.”
Higgs primes, “prime-like” sieves using Fibonacci numbers, primes
with digits in ascending order . . . the list is not endless but it does go
on and on, and you can examine it at your leisure, thanks to Neil
Sloane!
Smith numbers
Albert Wilansky named Smith numbers after his brother-in-law,
whose telephone number, 4937775 = 3  5  5  65837, has the prop-
erty that its digits’ sum is the same as that of its prime factors, 42.
Another example is: 666 = 2  3  3  37.
This is an excellent example of a property, spotted by chance, that
is plausibly a bit of trivia: so much so that at least one article has
been published by an indignant author arguing that Smith numbers
are indeed a waste of time and don’t deserve the effort devoted to
them.
In particular, since they depend entirely on the base being used,
aren’t they surely superficial? “Those who investigate Smith num-
bers are not trying to penetrate deep into the secrets of integers.
They are instead observing mere accidents of their representation
in an arbitrary system,” according to Underwood Dudley. (Ivars
Peterson’s MathTrek, October 27 1997: www.maa.org/mathland)
(Underwood 1994)
Maybe—but could they not be studying deep properties of certain
bases that allow Smith numbers to exist at all? This disagreement
illustrates how mathematicians, amateur and professional, differ in
their judgments of what is worthwhile—and sure enough, Smith
numbers turn out to be not totally devoid of interest.
All primes are Smith numbers, uninterestingly, and so are, 4, 22, 27,
58, 85, 94, 121, . . . and the number of the beast, 666. Much larger
isolated examples are known. Samuel Yates found a giant of
13,614,513 digits.
Smith numbers • 221

There is also an ingenious method of creating Smith numbers,
which links them to the prime repunits. Sham Oltikar and Keith Way-
land found in 1983 that if Rn is prime then 3304  Rn is a Smith num-
ber. Moreover, factor 3304 can be replaced by any of these numbers:
1540, 1720, 2170, 2440, 5590, 6040, 7930, 8344, 8470, 8920, . . .
There are 376 Smith numbers less than 10,000 and 29,928 Smiths
less than 106. It is conjectured that about 3% of any million consecu-
tive integers are Smith numbers. (Wikipedia online encyclopedia,
Smith number)
If there is an infinity of prime repunits, as conjectured, then there
will be an infinity of non-trivial Smith numbers. Wayne McDaniel has
since proved (1987) that there is indeed an infinity of Smith numbers,
without resolving that conjecture.
Another method is to start with any prime whose digits are all
zeros and 1s and multiply it by a suitable factor. Here are some of
Hoffman’s examples:
101  2 = 202
10111  140 = 1415540 = 10111  2  2  5  7
101111  21 = 2123331 = 101111  3  7
(Hoffman 1998)
Pat Costello in 1984 published seventy-five Smith numbers of the
form p  q  10k where p is a small prime and q is a Mersenne prime.
His largest example was 191  (2216091 −1)  10266, with 65,319 digits.
Kathy Lewis in 1994 found an infinite sequence of Smith numbers
of the form 11a  9Rn  10b, where Rn is the nth repunit. (Walter
Schneider, www.wschnei.de: “Smith Numbers”)

smooth numbers
Smooth numbers are very composite numbers, having many small
prime factors. They are a kind of dual to the prime numbers—a
222 • smooth numbers

prime has one big prime factor, itself, and smooth numbers have
none.
A number is k-smooth if it has no prime factor greater than k. So
the powers of 2 are the only 2-smooth numbers, and the 3-smooth
numbers are of the form 2n3m, and the 5-smooth numbers are of the
form 2n3m5q, and so on.
There are forty-six 10-smooth numbers less than 100, 140 less than
1000, 332 less than 10,000, and 587 less than 100,000.
Carl Pomerance used smooth numbers to prove that there are an infi-
nite number of Carmichael numbers, and they are also used in pri-
mality testing and factorization algorithms that often depend on
finding smooth numbers within a given range.

Sophie Germain primes
Sophie Germain (1776–1831) was one of the very earliest female
mathematicians. She educated herself at home in the library of her
father, who became a director of the Bank of France, and as a 
thirteen-year-old she read of the death of Archimedes, killed by a
Roman soldier as he examined a figure traced in the sand, and
decided to become a mathematician. At the age of eighteen, she
obtained the notes for Lagrange’s lectures on analysis, posed as a stu-
dent using the name Le Blanc, and sent a paper to Lagrange.
Extremely impressed, he decided to meet the young author, and so
discovered that “he” was a woman. They corresponded, and he
included some of her results in his Theory of Numbers, giving her
credit in a footnote.
A little later, she also wrote to Gauss under the same pseudonym,
having studied his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, and he was also
astonished when he discovered the sex of his correspondent,
remarking that “Sophie Germain proved to the world that even a
woman can accomplish something in the most rigorous and abstract
of sciences.”
Her greatest achievement during her lifetime was to win the prize of
the Académie des Sciences in response to a challenge to explain the
Sophie Germain primes • 223

creation of Chladni figures (seen when sand is scattered on a vibrat-
ing plate), but she is best remembered today for the Sophie Ger-
main primes. These are the odd primes q for which 2q + 1 is prime,
too. She proved in 1823 if p is a Sophie Germain prime, then there
are no integers, x, y, and z, none zero, and not multiples of p, such
that x p + y p = z p. This is an example of the “first case” of Fermat’s
Last Theorem.
The sequence of primes, p, such that 2p + 1 is also prime, starts,
2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, 113, 131, 173, 179, 191,
233, 239, 251, 281, 293, 359, . . . (Sloane A005384)
These are also the primes for which φ (n) is double a prime. Triplets
such that p, 2p + 1, and 4p + 3 are all prime start with these values
of p:
2, 5, 11, 41, 89, 179, 359, 509, 719, 1019, 1031, 1229,
1409, . . . (Sloane A007700)

safe primes
Sophie Germain primes are related to cryptography. If p and 2p + 1
are prime, then q = 2p + 1 is said to be a safe prime, because q −1
does not have many small factors and therefore cannot easily be fac-
tored, making the encryption more secure.
squarefree numbers
Many integers can be written as the product of a perfect square and
a number with no squared factor. For example,
12 = 22  3
50 = 52  2
288 = 122  2
35 = 5  7
224 • squarefree numbers

Other integers are squarefree. So 35 is squarefree, as are these num-
bers that are each the product of distinct prime factors, apart from 1:
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 
17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, . . .
The proportion of squarefree numbers less than N is roughly con-
stant, and tends to cN, where c = 6/π 2. Another way of putting this
is: what is the probability that a number is squarefree, having no
repeated prime factor?
The number of squarefree numbers less than n is equal to 6n/π 2
plus a factor that is roughly proportional to n as n tends to infin-
ity. On the other hand, the average number of square divisors of a
number N is roughly π 2/6. (Greger 1978)
The probability that two integers are coprime, that is, prime to each
other, is also 6/π 2. Both probabilities turn out to be equal to 1/ζ(2),
where ζ(n) is the zeta function introduced by Euler.
Stern prime
A Stern prime is a prime not of the form p + 2a2 where p is a prime
and a > 0. The largest known Stern prime is 1493. (Russo: Caldwell,
Prime Pages)
strong law of small numbers
Many mathematical sequences start by showing what seems to be a
strong pattern—but then the pattern disappears! The Fermat num-
bers are a perfect example. The first five are prime, but then the pat-
tern collapses.
The prime race between 4n + 1 and 4n + 3, analyzed by Little-
wood, is a more subtle example—it is a long time before the lead
changes at all, though eventually it changes infinitely often.
If we calculate powers of 3⁄2 and then take the integral part, we get
this sequence, which is also suggestive:

strong law of small numbers • 225

Well, well! Can this be the sequence of primes? No, of course not,
because (apart from the 1 at the start) the next number will be much
greater than 11. In fact it is 17, which is prime, but then the sequence
continues, 25, 38, 57, 86, . . .
That example comes from Professor Richard Guy, who for many
years edited the “Problems” section of the American Mathematical
Monthly and is also the author of Unsolved Problems in Number Theory
(1994). He has discussed this tricky phenomenon under the title “The
Strong Law of Small Numbers.” (Guy 1988; and 1990) As he puts it,
“There aren’t enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of
them.”
or
“Capricious coincidences cause careless conjectures.”
and
“Early exceptions eclipse eventual essentials.”
Here are some of his amusing examples involving prime numbers:
The numbers 31, 331, 3331, 33331, 333331, and 3333331 are all
prime, and so is the next number in the sequence, but 333333331 =
17  19607843. Early numbers in the sequence are likely to be prime
because no number in the sequence is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,
or 37.
The alternating sums of the factorials seem to be always prime:
3! −2! + 1! = 5
4! −3! + 2! −1! = 19
5! −4! + 3! −2! + 1! = 101
6! −5! + 4! −3! + 2! −1! = 619
7! −6! + 5! −4! + 3! −2! + 1! = 4421
The next in the sequence is also prime, but 9! −8! + 7! −6! + 5! −
4! + 3! −2! + 1! = 79  4139.
Can we always be certain, however, that a phenomenon is an exam-
ple of the strong law of small numbers? No, the mathematician can
only make a judgment.
If you divide 2n by n (from n = 1 onwards), this is how the
sequence of remainders starts:

The remainders appear to always be powers of 2. Are they? The
remainder sequence continues, 2, 4, 2, 4, 8, 0, 2, but then we come
to 218 = 262144 and 262144  10 (mod 18).
The sequence then continues, however, 2, 16, 8, 4, 2, 16, but then
breaks down again: 225 = 33554432  7 (mod 25).
Unlike the previous examples, we can’t say that the pattern has bro-
ken down completely. Rather, we might look for patterns among the
exceptions. For example, how many odd remainders are there? Are all
odd numbers a remainder eventually? When does the first remainder
3 occur, if ever? As it happens, D. H. and Emma Lehmer discovered
that 2n  3 (mod n) for the first time when n = 4700063497.
By sheer chance, it is not just likely but certain that there will be coin-
cidental patterns among the vast numbers of functions that a modern
computer can calculate. So we should be suspicious when it turns out
that 21  2n −1 and 7  4n + 1 are both prime when n = 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and
13, and composite for other values up to 17. The match then collapses.
The first function is prime for n = 18 while the second is composite, and
we can be pretty confident that the “pattern” was a statistical hoax.
Here is one more example, not taken from Richard Guy’s articles:
add an even number of consecutive primes, from 2, and then add 2:
2 + 3 + 2
= 7
2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2
= 19
2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 2
= 43
2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 2 = 79
2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + . . . + p2n + 2
=
The results seem always to be prime, but does this pattern continue?
No—the sequence breaks down when p2n = p22 and,
2 + 3 + . . . + 79 + 2 = 793 = 13  61
On the other hand, the sums taking an odd number of primes as far
as p2n + 1 are not only composite, being even, but tend to have several
factors. The first few are 4, 12, 30, 60, 102, 162, and 240.
Mathematics, and especially number theory, and not least the prime
numbers, are indeed exceptionally full of patterns, but our very
human capacity to spot patterns is even more exceptional!

trivia
G. H. Hardy in his book A Mathematician’s Apology gave several
examples of “trivial” properties of numbers, including the fact that
153 is the sum of the cubes of its digits,
153 = 13 + 53 + 33
and remarked, “These are odd facts, very suitable for puzzle columns
and likely to amuse amateurs, but there is nothing in them which
appeals to the mathematician.”
As if to endorse Hardy’s view, I notice that the current edition of A
Mathematician’s Apology has exactly 153 pages. So what? There are
indeed many recorded properties of numbers that seem little, if at all,
more significant than traditional number mysticism. An iccanobiF
prime is a Fibonacci number reversed, for example, 31 or 773. Is that
trivial or what? We can sink even lower. A James Bond prime has
been defined as any prime ending in—you guessed it!—007! The first
three are 4007, 6007, and 9007, but Sloane’s On-Line Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences declines to include it, naturally.
228 • trivia

The five-digit prime 12421 has a different property: can you spot it?
Yes, the digits rise and then fall, making it a Mountain prime, as well
as palindromic. I’m surprised it isn’t called a Peaky prime. It could
then be referred to euphoniously as a Perfectly Palindromic Peaky
Prime. But so what?
The largest known Holey prime is 4 followed by 16,131 9s. It’s
Holey because the digits 4 and 9 (and 0, 6, and 8, which do not fea-
ture) have holes inside, as written in our current Arabic numerals.
Actually, the devotees of Holey-ness have competition, because a
Pime has been defined as a prime that uses only digits with closed
loops, which means 0, 6, 8, and 9 but not 4. The smallest Pime is
89—now you know—but the second Holey prime, 409, is not a Pime
though the second Pime is of course Holey, because all Pimes are
Holey.
A Yarborough prime is defined rather differently but with similar
effect: its only digits are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, so an anti–Yarborough
prime is—yes!—a prime made up of zeros and 1s (and not just in
binary). I can’t help feeling that “Holey Yarborough Pimes!” sounds
like an obscure swear word.
I do apologize. I am being carried away by the Spirit of Triviality.
To be solemn for a moment, it is indeed a delicate issue to decide
when trivialness turns into seriosity. For example, Smith numbers
have often been dismissed as trivial because their definition depends
on their digits—but there is a well-known connection between Smith
numbers and repunits, and no one thinks that repunits are trivial,
because they are closely related to decimals and their periods (there
go the digits again!) and there are some deep unsolved problems and
conjectures about decimal periods, including Artin’s conjecture,
named after one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth cen-
tury. QED! Smith numbers are non-trivial.
Now, what about 153 = 13 + 53 + 33? Any offers?

twin primes
The primes include many pairs differing by 2: 3-5, 5-7, 11-13, and 17-
19, and so on. These are the twin primes. The only number that
appears in two twin pairs is 5, and 3 is the only number in the
sequence not of the form 6n  1.
twin primes • 229

The number of twin primes less than N naturally declines as N
increases. The numbers of pairs less than 10n are,
2, 8, 35, 205, 1224, 8169, 58980, 440312, 3424506, 27412679,
224376048, . . . (Sloane A007508)
The twin primes conjecture is that there is an infinity of them. Hardy
and Littlewood went further and conjectured that the number of 
twin primes less than n is approximately 2Cn/(log n)2, where C =
0.6601618158 . . . is the twin prime constant.
Provided x is greater than a certain integer, x′ (which can in theory
be calculated) then
π2(x) <
where π2(x) is the number of pairs of twin primes less than x. (Brun
1920) It was Brun who proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the
twin primes converges.
Jing-Run Chen proved in 1966 that there is an infinity of primes p
such that p + 2 is either prime or the product of two primes. If p is
prime and p + 2 is either a prime or a semiprime, then the number
of such pairs less than n is at least 1.05 × 2Cn/(log n)2 where C is the
same as before.
The current record twin primes are 33218925  2169690  1, with

He noticed at once that the primes seemed to settle onto certain
diagonal lines, and realized that this was because squares lying on
straight lines have differences that are increasing linearly—so they
represent quadratics. Hence, “It is a property of the visual brain
which allows one to discover such lines at once and also notice
many other peculiarities of distribution of points in two dimensions,”
as Ulam and his coworkers remarked in a 1964 paper published in
the American Mathematical Monthly. (Stein, Ulam, and Wells 1964)
In this figure the main diagonal is the function n2 + n + 1. The next
figure starts with 41 and the values of Euler’s quadratic formula
appear along the marked diagonal.
The deeper problem is why some quadratic expressions produce
such a high proportion of primes. Among the values of Euler’s prime
quadratic x2 + x + 41, of the first 2,398 numbers generated by the for-

mula, exactly half are primes. Checking all such numbers less than
10,000,000, Ulam and his coworkers found the proportion of primes
to be 0.475.
For the quadratic 4x2 + 170x + 1847, the proportion of primes is
0.466; for 4x2 + 4x + 59, it is 0.437. Other quadratics go to the other
extreme: only 5% of the products of the formula 2x2 + 4x + 117 are
prime.

unitary divisors
If N = st and if s and t have no common factor, then s and t are uni-
tary divisors of N. By convention, 1 and N are included. So the uni-
tary divisors of 24 = 3  23 are 1, 3, 8, and 24 only.
All the divisors of a number are unitary, if and only if it is a prime
or the product of distinct primes.
Euler’s generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem says that if p |/ a,
then aφ ( p)  1 (mod p). It is also true that if a is a unitary divisor of
n, then there is a number, k, greater than 1, such that ak  a (mod
n). For example, 8 is a unitary divisor of 24, although 8 and 24 are
not coprime, and 83  8 (mod 24).

New “World Record” Unitary Aliquot Sequence Completed
by Jack Brennen
On 11 July 2001, the longest known terminating unitary aliquot
sequence was computed to its termination.
A unitary aliquot sequence is constructed similarly to a “standard”
aliquot sequence, except that instead of adding divisors, one adds up
unitary divisors. A unitary divisor D of a number N satisfies two
requirements: D divides evenly into N, and D and N have no com-
mon divisor other than 1.
It is conjectured that all unitary aliquot sequences eventually either
enter a closed cycle, or terminate by reaching the number 1. Cer-
tainly no counterexample is known, and the author has now verified
the conjecture for all starting numbers up to 400000000.
This new “world record” unitary aliquot sequence begins with the
number 151244562, and terminates 16657 steps later by reaching the
number 1.
The largest member of the sequence occurs at step 4641, and is a
90-digit number: . . .
C90 = 2  3  3  3  3  503  9682217399  P76

6627017667109514519500763883
In all, there were 40488 distinct prime factors needed to complete
this sequence, and thus 40488 numbers were proven prime. . . .
The computation of the sequence occurred over a period of about
29 weeks, using one 450 MHz Pentium-II on a full-time basis, and
three other similar machines on a part-time basis. . . .

untouchable numbers
An untouchable number is any number that cannot be the sum of
aliquot parts (proper divisors) of n. In other words, it is never a value
of σ(n) −n. The sequence starts, 2, 5, 52, 88, 96, 120, 124, 146, 162,
178, . . . (Sloane A005114)
The only known odd untouchable is 5, and it is conjectured to be
unique.
There is an unfinity of untouchable numbers. (Erdös 1973)
The numbers of untouchables less than 10n for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . start,
2, 5, 89, 1212, . . . (Sloane A057978)
weird numbers
A number is weird if it is abundant but not pseudoperfect. The small-
est weird number is 70, because its factors sum to 74:
1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74
but no subset of these factors sums to 70.
There is an infinite number of weird numbers, including twenty-four
under 106. The sequence starts,
70, 836, 4030, 5830, 7192, 7912, 9272, 10430, 10570, 
10792, 10990, 11410, 11690, . . . (Sloane A006037)
Wieferich primes
These are named after Arthur Joseph Alwin Wieferich (1884–1954),
who in 1909 published a surprising criterion for the first case of Fer-
mat’s Last Theorem: if there exist integers x, y, z such that x p + y p +
z p = 0 where p is an odd prime and p does not divide xyz, then
p2 | 2p −1 −1. Such primes are called Wieferich primes. (Fermat’s Lit-
tle Theorem says that if p is prime, then it divides 2p −1 −1.)
Wieferich primes • 235

The only known Wieferich primes are 1093, discovered by W. Meiss-
ner in 1913, and 3511, discovered by N. G. W. H. Beeger in 1922.
(Sloane A001220)
Richard McIntosh completed a Wieferich prime search, on March 9,
2004, up to 1.25  1015, without finding any new primes.
The two known Wieferich primes lead to these curious digit patterns
in binary: 10922 = 10001000100; 35102 = 110110110110.
In 1910, Mirimanoff added that if the first case of Fermat’s Last The-
orem is false for exponent p, then 3p −1 −1 is divisible by p2.
The abc conjecture implies that there exists an infinity of Wieferich
primes. The number less than x is at least C log x for some constant
C. However, Silverman also proved, in 1988, that if the abc conjec-
ture is true, then for any a greater than 1 there is an infinity of primes
p, for which p2 |/ a p −1 −1.
The two values of p between 3 and 232 for which p2 | 3 p −1 −1 are 11
and 1006003.
Curiously, when a = 99, there are five small values of p for which
p 2 | a p −1 −1: p = 5, 7, 13, 19, and 83. (Montgomery 1993)
It has been conjectured that the probability that a prime p is a
Wieferich prime is 1/p. It has also been conjectured that Mersenne
numbers with prime exponents are squarefree. This is made highly
probable by the theorem that if p 2 | Mq, then p is a Wieferich prime.
The condition p 2 divides a p −1 −1 for a = 5, has solution p =
188748146801, and the “reverse” is true also: p a −1 −1 is divisible by
a2 = 25. (Keller and Richstein 2004)
Wilson’s theorem
John Wilson (1741–1793) is only remembered for Wilson’s theorem,
which states that if p is prime, then ( p −1)! + 1 is divisible by p, as
illustrated by the first few primes:

Ironically, Wilson was not only not the first to discover this theo-
rem—it appears in Leibniz’s papers—but he didn’t prove it. Lagrange
did that in 1773, and also showed the converse, that if the equation
is true, then p is prime.
Wilson’s theorem can be expressed in different forms. For example:
( p −2)! −1  0 (mod p)
2( p −3)! + 1  0 (mod p)
6( p −4)! −1  0 (mod p)
and in general: (q −1)!( p −q)! −(−1)q  0 (mod p)
It follows from Wilson’s theorem that if p is an odd prime, then

and

ber is prime: the largest ever proved by its use is probably
1099511628401. (Rupinski: Caldwell, Prime Pages)

Wilson’s theorem implies that n and n + 2 are a pair of twin primes
if and only if,
4((n −1)! + 1) + n  0 mod n(n + 2)
For example, if n = 5, 4((n −1)! + 1) + n = 105 = 3  5  7.
Wilson primes
A Wilson prime is a prime number such that ( p −1)!  −1 (mod p2).
The only known Wilson primes are 5, 13, and 563, found by Gold-
berg in 1953, using an early electronic computer. There are no oth-
ers less than 500,000,000.
By a heuristic argument, the 4th Wilson prime might be expected
round about 5  1023.
It has been conjectured that the probability that a prime p is a Wil-
son prime is 1/p.

Wolstenholme’s numbers, and theorems
Joseph Wolstenholme (1829–1891) was professor of mathematics at
the Royal Indian Engineering College. He was a friend of Leslie
Stephen, whose daughter, Virginia Woolf, was a young girl when
Wolstenholme shared their family holidays. She later incorporated
Wolstenholme into one of her most famous books, To the Lighthouse,
as the model for Mr. Augustus Carmichael.
In 1862 Wolstenholme proved that if p is a prime, not 2 or 3, then the
numerator of the harmonic number,
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + . . . + 1/( p −1)
is divisible by p2. The numerators of these sums are called the Wol-
stenholme numbers, and their sequence starts,
1, 3, 11, 25, 137, 49, 363, 761, 7129, 7381, 83711, 86021, 1145993,
1171733, 1195757, 2436559, 42142223, . . . (Sloane A001008)
Similarly, the numerator of
1 + 1/22 + 1/32 + . . . + 1/( p −1)2
is divisible by p if and only if p is prime. (Alkan 1994) The sequence
of these numerators starts,
1, 5, 49, 205, 5269, 5369, 266681, 1077749, 9778141, 1968329,
239437889, . . . (Sloane A007406)
The numerator of 1 + 1/23 + 1/33 + . . . + 1/( p −1)3 is divisible by 
p2 if and only if p is prime and p > 5, and the numerator of 1 +
1/24 + 1/34 + . . . + 1/( p −1)4 is divisible by p if and only if p is prime
and p > 7.

The Wolstenholme converse—that if n satisfies the congruence then
it is prime—has not been proved, but it is known to be true for even
n and when n is a power of 3. (V. T. K. Weber, www.mat.unb.br)

Woodall primes
The Woodall numbers, named after H. J. Woodall, who published an
account of them in 1917 written with Cunningham, are of the form,
n  2n −1. Prime Woodall numbers are sometimes called Cullen
primes of the second kind. The sequence of Woodall numbers starts,
1, 7, 23, 63, 159, 383, 895, . . .
A Woodall number is prime only when n = 2, 3, 6, 30, 75, 81, 115,
123, 249, 362, 384, . . .
It has been conjectured that almost all Woodall numbers are com-
posite.
The largest known Woodall prime is 667071  2667071 −1 (200,815 dig-
its). It was discovered by Manfred Toplic and Yves Gallot in April
2002. (Caldwell, Prime Pages)
The prime 2521 −1 can also be written as 512  2512 −1, making it both
a Woodall prime and a Mersenne prime. (Dobb: Caldwell, Prime
Pages)

zeta mysteries: the quantum connection
Although the Riemann zeta-function is an analytic function with
[a] deceptively simple definition, it keeps bouncing around
almost randomly without settling down to some regular asymp-
totic pattern. The Riemann zeta-function displays the essence of
chaos in quantum mechanics . . . smooth, and yet seemingly
unpredictable.
—M. C. Gutzwiller (1990, 377)
The primes in general and the Riemann hypothesis in particular
might seem to represent the purest mathematics possible, so why
might there be any connection at all with physics? Yet that is just
what David Hilbert and George Pólya conjectured. As Pólya
explained to Andrew Odlyzko:
I spent two years in Göttingen ending around the beginning of 1914. I tried
to learn analytic number theory from Landau. He asked me one day: “You
know some physics. Do you know a physical reason that the Riemann
hypothesis should be true.” This would be the case, I answered, if the non-
trivial zeros of the zeta-function were so connected with the physical prob-
lem that the Riemann hypothesis would be equivalent to the fact that all the
eigenvalues of the physical problem are real.
I never published this remark, but somehow it became known and it is
still remembered. (Pólya 1982)
Pólya is referring to the fact that the eigenvalues of a symmetrical
matrix are real. If the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function are 1⁄2 + ibn,
then the bn would be the eigenvalues. Neither he nor Hilbert, who
made the same suggestion, had the slightest idea what the matrix
might be.
A connection appeared as the result of a chance meeting in 1973,
when Hugh Montgomery was reluctantly introduced to the great
Freeman Dyson, the English-born mathematician and physicist who is
famous for having reconciled the theories of Julian Schwinger and
Richard Feynman in quantum theory. Montgomery remarked that he
had been studying the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and he
mentioned a formula for their distribution, 1 −(sin (πr)/(πr))2. Dyson
replied at once, to his surprise and Montgomery’s, that this was the
density of the pair correlation of eigenvalues of a certain set of ran-
dom matrices. (Sabbagh 2002, 134–36) As it happens, physicists have
zeta mysteries: the quantum connection • 241

a well-developed theory of the distribution of the eigenvalues of ran-
dom matrices, which are used to model the energy levels of nuclei
and other systems of particles.
Montgomery and Dyson never met again, never spoke again, yet
this one chance encounter pointed to a potentially profound con-
nection between quantum mechanics and number theory, which
mathematicians and physicists have been exploring ever since. In
particular, Andrew Odlyzko found through massive calculation that
the zeros of the zeta function have the same pair correlation function
as the eigenvalues of what are called GUE (Gaussian unitary ensem-
ble) matrices. This result, inspired by Montgomery, is now known as
the Montgomery-Odlyzko law.
It is entirely appropriate that George Pólya, who wrote several
popular books on the role of analogy in mathematics, should have
been the original inspiration for such a wonderful sequence of “con-
nections”! This analogy has already benefited both physicists and
number theorists. Physicists benefit because energy levels are usually
hard to compute, whereas mathematicians have very efficient meth-
ods for calculating zeros of the zeta function.
There is another, related, connection. Quantum chaos studies the
transitions from quantum mechanical systems, which are not chaotic,
and classical Newtonian systems, which can be. It has led physicists
to make predictions about the relationships between energy levels
that can then be applied, by analogy, to the Riemann zeta function.
Surprise! The predictions are confirmed!
And that’s not all! In her paper “Quantum-like Chaos in Prime
Number Distribution and in Turbulent Fluid Flows,” A. M. Selvam
claims, “Number theoretical concepts are intrinsically related to the
quantitative description of dynamical systems of all scales ranging
from the microscopic subatomic dynamics to macroscale turbulent
fluid flows such as the atmospheric flows,” and in particular that the
prime numbers are analogous to eddies in turbulent fluid flows and
that the frequencies of prime numbers follow quantum-like mechan-
ical laws. She adds another analogy: “Roger Penrose discovered in
1974 the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern. . . . The fundamental
investigation of tilings which fill space completely is analogous to
investigating the manner in which matter splits up into atoms and
natural numbers split up into product of primes.” (Selvam 2001)
In addition, the Riemann zeta function also shows up in the theory
of Brownian motion and in the study of diffusion and percolation
242 • zeta mysteries: the quantum connection

processes. Even this, as you might have guessed, isn’t all. Xiao-Song
Lin of the University of California has noticed an analogy between
the Jones polynomial in knot theory and the Ihara-Hashimoto-Bass
zeta function in graph theory. Inspired by the Montgomery-Odlyzko
law, Xiao-Song Lin has “carried out some computer experiments on
the Jones polynomial. Our data indicate that, quite likely, zeros of
the Jones polynomial of alternating knots may obey certain statistical
laws as well.”
Little could an ancient Greek have realized as he read Euclid’s pre-
sentation of the prime numbers in his Elements, in a painfully con-
voluted manner because the Greeks lacked a really efficient
language and notation for the subject, that there might just possibly
be a connection with the knots he used to tie his shoes and the
prime numbers.
Of course, none of this current speculation actually proves how the
zeros of the Riemann zeta function behave. It could be that we have
just what physicists are accustomed to and just what mathematicians
do not find ultimately satisfactory—a useful but imperfect model of
reality.
And yet—Pythagoras claimed that the universe was made of num-
bers and Leopold Kronecker (1823–1891) claimed that “God made
the integers and all the rest is the work of man.” Who knows? Per-
haps the world is even more cunningly constructed out of the prime
numbers!

Glossary
These explanations are in addition to those made at the end of the
introduction. Many terms are explained simply by going to their
entry; for example, abundant number, perfect numbers, or quadratic
residues. Others will be found by going to the index, where the page
number of an entry that explains the term is in bold. A few, such as
the first three examples of notation in this glossary, are explained in
the text, but it will not be obvious where.
Notation
φ(n) [some authors write phi(n)] is Euler’s totient function, equal to
the number of integers less than the integer n that are also prime to
n, that is, have no common factor with n.
So φ(10) = 4 because there are four numbers less than 10 and
prime to it: 1, 3, 7, 9.
d(n) means the number of divisors of the integer n. The unit, 1, is
included and so is the number n, so d(12) = 6 because 12 has the
divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 itself.
σ(n) is the sum of the divisors of the integer n, so σ(12) = 1 + 2 +
3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28.
Terms
aliquot parts
The expression is rather old-fashioned. The aliquot
parts of a number are its proper divisors, meaning its divisors apart
from the number itself. The number 1 is always included. So the
aliquot parts of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 15.

binomial coefficients
These appear in algebra when a power
such as (1 + x)5 is expanded:
(1 + x)5 = 1 + 5x + 10x2 + 10x 3 + 5x 4 + x5
The binomial coefficients in this case are 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1. They also
appear in Pascal’s triangle.
common factor
Two integers have a common factor if a number,
other than 1, divides both of them exactly.
composite number
A number that can be written as the product
of two or more prime numbers. The number 1 is neither a prime
number nor a composite number.
coprime
Two integers are coprime if they have no common fac-
tor.
letters
Letters stand for integers unless otherwise indicated. The
letter c often stands for a constant that may not be an integer.
logarithm
The natural logarithm of n, the log to base e, is written
as log n. This does not mean the usual logarithm to base 10, which
would be written log10n.
number
Throughout this book, “number” refers to a positive inte-
ger or whole number, unless stated otherwise.
primitive prime factor
Given a sequence of integers, a primi-
tive prime factor is a prime factor of a number in the sequence that
is not a factor of any previous number in the sequence. In other
words, that particular prime factor is appearing for the first time.
squarefree
If any prime factor of an integer divides it more than
once, then it is not squarefree. Otherwise it is squarefree. For exam-
ple, 12 = 22  3, so 12 is not squarefree, and neither is 90 = 2  32  5.
However, 15 = 3  5 and 105 = 3  5  7 are both squarefree.

Some Prime Web Sites
There are thousands of sites featuring prime numbers. Two enthusiasts vie,
in my judgment, for the top Prize for Primes: Chris Caldwell and Neil
Sloane.
Chris Caldwell is Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics
at the University of Tennessee at Martin. He got his PhD in algebraic num-
ber theory in 1984 and now specializes in number theory and using com-
puters to teach mathematics—especially on the World Wide Web via his
massive Prime Pages site, which has received more than a dozen awards for
excellence.
The Prime Pages is at www.utm.edu/research/primes, where you will also
find his personal Web site. A prominent icon of the Statue of Liberty at the
262 • Bibliography

top of his own site is labeled “America, a Beacon, not a Policeman,” and
there are links to www.againstbombing.org/index.htm, which is in turn
titled, “Americans Against Bombing: Americans Against World Empire.” I
mention this both to show my approval and because, I am happy to note,
mathematicians tend to be pacific and internationalist—perhaps for the
obvious reason that mathematics itself crosses every kind of boundary,
internally and externally.
The Prime Pages is an incredibly varied cornucopia of facts, figures, and
references, proofs, puzzles, and conjectures, definitions and theorems, lists
and tables—if you want it, there’s a good chance Chris Caldwell has it.
But even he cannot have everything: the prime numbers are far too large
a subject. So another dazzling site that is a pleasure to visit is Neil Sloane’s
On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, at www.research.att.com/
~njas/sequences.
“Integer Sequences” in the title might seem a bit limiting, but it’s amazing
how much mathematics is—or can be—linked to sequences of whole num-
bers. For example, Wolstenholme’s theorems are about the sums of the har-
monic series, that is, fractions, not integers, but of course fractions have
numerators and denominators, and these form integer sequences! So type in
“Wolstenholme,” choose the option “word,” and you get four references to
the index,
Wolstenholme numbers: A001008, A007406, A007408, A007410
and twenty-one references to the database, starting with this lengthy entry:
A093689 Wolstenholme’s theorem states that prime p > 3 divides A007406(p
−1). It is not difficult to show that this implies p also divides A007406((p −
1)/2). In most instances, a(n) = (prime(n) −1)/2. Exceptions occur for primes
in A093690, which have a smaller a(n). Note that if p divides A007406(k)
for k < (p −1)/2, then p divides A007406(p −k −1). Another interesting
observation: it appears that p = 7 is the only prime that divides A007406(k)
for some k > p −1; 7 divides A007406(26) = 23507608254234781649. Also
note that when p > 3 and 2p −1 are both prime, they divide A007406
(p −1).
You can enter the consecutive terms of a sequence (you don’t have to start
at the beginning, which indeed is sometimes ambiguous) or a search term,
such as “Wolstenholme,” as we have seen, or a Sloane sequence number:
the current catalog numbers all start with an A. (They used to start with M
or N. The prime number sequence is now A00040; it used to be M0652 or
N0241.)
MathWorld, at http://mathworld.wolfram.com, describes itself as “the web’s
most extensive mathematics resource.” It is “Created and maintained by Eric
Weisstein with contributions from the world mathematics community,” and
is supported by Wolfram Research and the National Science Foundation.
Bibliography • 263

When I last checked, there were 11,838 entries, of which more than 260 are
listed under “Prime Numbers.”
An especially attractive feature is the MathWorld Headline News, which is
currently reporting (July 15, 2004) that R. F. Arenstorf seems close to settling
the twin primes conjecture and that Josh Findley has discovered the 41st
Mersenne prime.
Walter Schneider at Kreuzmattenstrasse 8, 79276 Reute, Germany, runs
Mathews: The Archive of Recreational Mathematics Web site, at www.
wschnei.de/index.html.
Carlos Rivera is the author of The Prime Puzzles & Problems Connection, at
www.primepuzzles.net. Readers will note several references in my bibliog-
raphy. A nice feature is that it contains extensive responses from solvers.
The Wikipedia online encyclopedia also has interesting information about
prime numbers, at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number.
Hidden among Chris Caldwell’s Prime Pages is a page by Andrew Booker,
The Nth Prime Page, which allows you to find the Nth prime, up to N = 1012,
or the value of π(N), for N up to 3  1013.
Hisanori Mishima runs the WIFC (World Integer Factorization Center) at
www.asahi-net.or.jp/~KC2H-MSM/mathland/matha1, which includes list-
ings of factors of many types of numbers from Cunningham to Fermat to
Riesel to Woodall and many in between.
Yves Gallot, who is a prolific finder of assorted primes, factorizations etc.,
has his own Chronology of Prime Number Records at http://perso.wanadoo.
fr/yves.gallot/primes/chrrcds.html.
Dario Alpern has a useful site at www.alpertron.com.ar that has one good
feature and three brilliant features. You can solve any quadratic equation in
two variables; you can use the “Factorization using the Elliptic Curve
Method” facility, which gives not just the factors of the number you type in
but also d(n), the number of divisors, σ(n), their sum, and φ(n), Euler’s
totient function; you can use his “Discrete logarithm calculator,” which
allows you to solve ax  b (mod N) for x; and you can play with his Ulam
spiral applet, which gives the equation of the diagonal line through your
mouse-selected point, its coordinates, and the first few values of the func-
tion. Excellent!
