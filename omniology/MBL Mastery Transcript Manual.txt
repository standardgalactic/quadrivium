DVD 1 – MBL & The Agreement Reversal 
 
 
MBL Crash Course Introduction 
 
Igor: 
Welcome everyone. How are you doing? Who’s excited to be here? That’s 
what I like to see. Today is believe or not, not the main seminar day. This is 
our bonus day.  
 
 
To kind of set expectations a little bit, the purpose of today is to essentially 
give you a crash course in the Advanced Covert Hypnosis method, the Mind 
Bending Language and so on because that’s going to be the foundation on 
which the actual work that we’ll be doing in the main part of the training is 
going to be about. 
 
 
This is a crash course. How many of you have the Advanced Covert Hypnosis 
DVD’s? Excellent. How many of you have got the Mind Bending Language 
Cards? You should have one or the other. Otherwise you’ve snuck in and if 
you were here for Graham Thornton, you’re in a different room. 
 
 
How many of you had a chance to actually watch or listen to those things? 
How many have not done so yet? This is the main reason we’re doing this. 
Out of those of you who have watched it, how many of you have had a chance 
to actually practice some of the Mind Bending Language? The numbers are 
diminishing as I ask these questions. 
 
 
Not a surprise there, which is again why we have this bonus day. Really what 
today is about is to give you experiential knowledge of what you’ve already 
got on your videotapes, your audiotapes, the cards and so on. 
 
 
For those of you who have been through the actual live Advanced Covert 
Hypnosis course, who watched the DVD’s or got the CD’s and the card decks 
and have started actually playing with them and got kind of fluent with them, 
today is going to be more of a quick recap.

It’s a chance to really explore that language again. Hopefully there will be 
some nuances in here that will be new for you as well, but don’t worry too 
much if it isn’t the case.  
 
 
The main thing is to just dive in and have fun with this. I need you to be fluent 
with this language because then we can focus on the really advanced 
concepts with it when the actual main program begins. Is that okay with you? 
 
 
So as to not overtax you too much, we’re just going to keep today relatively 
short. It’s only going to be three sessions. We’ll be breaking around 3:30 or so. 
It’s really literally just to drill you into getting these maneuvers into you.  
 
 
Then tomorrow we’ll actually start the main seminar and that’s when you’ll 
have to hold onto your hats. If you don’t have a hat, please bring one 
tomorrow because you’ll have to have something to hold onto.  
 
 
In terms of what we’ll be doing here today – this is something I’ll remind you 
about again tomorrow when we get into the main program, but please bear in 
mind this is adult learning, which means you get to learn in any way that 
pleases you. I really don’t care what you do. 
 
 
If you need to do handstands to learn something, by all means do a 
handstand. I just hope that you won’t break anything on you or on someone 
else doing so. The main thing when you’re doing whatever process you need 
to do to learn something properly is just make sure you take other people into 
account and that you respect their space.  
 
 
If you have to get up and get a drink of water or go to the bathroom or 
anything like that, just do it quietly so that people don’t get too disturbed or 
disrupted by that. Other than that, really whatever you need to do to learn, 
please go ahead and do that. 
 
 
Take notes if you want to or don’t take notes. There will be portions of today 
in particular where it will be difficult to take notes just because there will be a 
lot of activity, and there will be other times when you can kind of recapture 
with that. 
 
 
Rest assured that any notes that you’ll see me putting on the screen for you 
will be sent to you, so you’ll have a copy of everything that you see here. If 
you still want to take notes a bit just to have that extra, by all means do so.

It’s not necessary but you’re welcome to do so. You’ll be sent those things 
anyway. 
 
 
It’s adult learning. As I remind most people at every course, it means you are 
responsible for yourself as a human being. From time to time – maybe today 
or maybe over the next few days – you may come across some challenge or 
something that you can’t quite wrap your head around and that’s fine. It’s 
expected. 
 
 
Those of you who have trained with me before know that there comes a point 
in most training’s where you have no idea what’s going on but are really 
happy about it.  
 
 
That being happy about it bit is actually important. If there’s anything that’s 
interfering with you – in other words you get into more negative states and 
you’re not in the ideal state to be learning stuff, it’s your responsibility to get 
yourself out of that again. 
 
 
You’ve had a lifetime of experiences to keep yourself emotionally stable, and I 
expect you to continue with those lifetime experiences in here. The reason 
I’m saying this really is because it’s my experience that when it comes to the 
learning process, Western education has done a wonderful job of destroying 
our faith in our abilities to do that. 
 
 
You are all incredibly capable learners. The things that you are capable of 
without even realizing it are just incredible. There are only two reasons that 
you may come across a bump in the road to your learning process – or maybe 
three or four. Who knows? 
 
 
But the main reasons for a block in that process to occur are: 
 
1. You’re expecting something of yourself in terms of your learning 
process and what you’re trying to achieve that is different from what I 
need you to be doing. 
 
 
 
Rest assured this is not my first dog and pony show. The materials that you’ll 
be coming across are going to be paced in a way that is actually going to be 
very easy, and if you just let go of it and just have fun with it, it will be a lot of 
fun to do and very easy to remember.

If it’s not, if you’re doing something that is difficult, then chances are you’re 
doing something other than what I’ve asked you to do. If that’s the case, you 
have two choices – you can either stop it, or you can suffer and enjoy the fact 
that you’ve made yourself suffer. It’s your choice. 
 
2. The only other reason why something may not be entirely clear to you 
is not because an emotion is arising or some kind of learning block is 
arising. It’s just because you haven’t put all the pieces together yet.  
 
Over the course of today especially, but also when we get into the main 
seminar – and I’ll remind you of this tomorrow, so don’t worry about that part 
– I have to expose you to a lot of different ideas, experiences and so on before 
you can put the jigsaw puzzle together. 
 
It’s kind of like you buy a jigsaw puzzle and you kind of throw it out on the 
floor. You’ve got to organize it a little bit first to make sure all the pieces are 
there. Has anyone tried to put together a jigsaw puzzle where there are 
pieces missing, or worse where you have other pieces from a different puzzle 
mixed in? Doesn’t that kind of mess you up a little bit? 
 
We’re trying to avoid that here, and to do that I need to give you a whole 
bunch of different experiences and exercises and so on. Don’t concern 
yourself about putting it all together yet, today especially. Today the only 
thing I care about is how natural, how easily can you toss out Mind Bending 
Language without rhyme or reason.  
 
There’s no strategy expected of you. There’s no skill expected of you. There’s 
no result expected of you. There’s nothing expected of you other than can 
you speak in a way that might get you arrested by a police officer because he 
thought you might have taken a little something or other. 
 
If you can do that, then we’re good to go through the actual main program. If 
you’re not quite there yet, it’s probably because you’re thinking too much 
about stuff. Just let stuff come out. Does that make sense to you? Is that an 
agreement we can make? 
 
So, just enjoy the process. I see a lot of familiar faces here – a lot of them, 
which is excellent for me because that means I can probably shut-up soon and 
get on with the training. There are a few new faces as well, and you will come 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
9 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
to quickly learn that whatever you expected of this may well be different. 
Other than that, just really dive in and have fun with this. 
 
Mind Bending Language 
 
Igor: 
Mind Bending Language has come a long, long way since I first came across it. 
As you are probably familiar, I didn’t invent the concept of Mind Bending 
Language. That was created by my mentor, John Overdurf, someone we have 
to all give credit to for this.  
 
I may be taking it in different directions than him, especially the influencing 
session that we’ll be coming onto in the main seminar, but we still have to 
give him credit for the core idea of this. It’s been a very long history now in 
terms of how this has evolved.  
 
The first stage of that history of course was him just figuring things out for 
himself, putting together things from Ericksonian hypnosis, NLP, Zen sayings, 
you know the koans, Sufi stories and basically things that work with language 
to change people very quickly.  
 
He became very good at it. Then people like me came along and tried to learn 
it from him and watched him and said this is great, what the hell is he doing? 
It took a long time to figure out how to do that. He has innovated a huge 
amount of stuff along the way. If you ever get a chance to see him, you will 
not regret doing so. 
 
What we’ve done here, especially what we’ll be doing here today, I have 
attempted to organize the linguistic aspects of that, the language parts of 
that, so that it becomes very easy to at least mechanically emulate it.  
 
It may not necessarily have the same artistry yet. That’s what the next four 
days will be about, but I want you to get mechanically competent with it. This 
hopefully will make life very easy for you because all you have to think about 
is the fact that you’ve been speaking the English language for at least one 
year.  
 
If you haven’t been speaking the English language for more than a year, 
chances are you have no idea what I’m talking about anyway right now, so it 
doesn’t matter, but if you have that as your basic reference experience, if you 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
10 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
have the ability to converse with other people, if you have the ability to make 
meaning out of things and communicate meaning, then you have all the base 
materials you need to become great with Mind Bending Language. 
 
The Mind Bending Language is designed to alter someone’s state of mind, 
someone’s state of thinking, someone’s way of feeling and doing things. It’s 
designed to alter your minds and the minds of the people that you get to 
meet, and it’s supposed to do that in a fast, eloquent fun sort of way, which 
means I wouldn’t be too surprised if you found yourselves going in and out of 
different mental experiences whenever you’re here over the next few days. 
 
It means you get to surprise yourself with how much easier speaking in mind 
bending ways really is than you had imagined. Our imaginations are powerful 
things. They can create things that never existed. Sometimes it creates ideas 
that don’t fit the real world because they’re not based on an experience yet. 
 
To the extent you have imaginings that motivate you in terms of learning 
Mind Bending Language, enjoy those. Those ideas that you might have but 
you haven’t tested yet, you can put on a shelf and wait to reevaluate them 
until the whole process of this learning experience has been passed, because 
how could you possibly evaluate an idea, a dream or a goal until you have an 
experience of it? 
 
A great pianist can sit right there and just think about a piano and remember 
the feeling of the keys on his fingers and the sound that it makes when he 
presses just so, and you have all heard the sound a piano makes, and some of 
you even know what it feels like to touch the key and make it ring in a certain 
way and some of you do not, and everything you learn is based on an 
experience like that. 
 
You have imaginings, which get adapted to actual experiences, and some of 
those experiences make no sense until you look back on them and realize 
they’re a foundation on which everything else is built.  
 
I’d like for you to develop a really solid foundation in language, understanding 
it, feeling it, knowing it so that the way you speak to people at the end of our 
experiences here may sound the same to them but there will be a little catch 
in there, a little something that makes you seem just somehow more 
understandable, somehow more correct, somehow easier to follow your 
thoughts.

When you do that, does it really matter whether you call it Mind Bending 
Language or hypnotic language? If they’re cycling through mental states and 
changing as a result, does it really matter what you call that? Not really. So, 
one of the things I’m going to ask you to do is to put on pause or on hold what 
you believe hypnosis is all about.  
 
Just pause that idea and come back to it after having some experiences, 
especially today. We’re not necessarily going to talk so much about hypnosis 
and the conditions that created the ABS Formula that some of you will be 
familiar with, because I’m more interested in the language that will create 
those things by default, and that’s what we’ll be focusing on mostly today. Is 
that something we can do? 
 
Hypnotic Context 
 
Igor: 
The first thing we want to do is realize that any form of hypnosis, whether it’s 
Mind Bending Language or anything else, only ever exists inside of a context, 
a social context. Without that context, it becomes meaningless to say what 
should I do to persuade someone about this, that or the other? It becomes 
meaningless because you have no idea who you’re dealing with. At what point 
in their life, where are you? What are the agreed rules of social engagement? 
 
Right now the agreed rules are very different from the ones you have at a 
cocktail party, which are different from the ones you have in a business 
meeting, which are different from the ones you have with strangers or clients 
and so on. 
 
But there is one relatively universal experience – at least in our society – that 
happens at pretty much any social engagement, which is that people get to 
know each other. If they already know each other, what do they usually say? 
If you have a friend and you meet them again, what’s the classic thing you do? 
You shake hands and say, how are you? Isn’t that kind of what you do? 
 
I know a lot of you in this room have met each other before at different 
seminars, so that would be an appropriate question to ask. Others of course 
are people you meet for the first time, so asking them how are you is a good 
question to ask, although usually there are more typical questions, aren’t 
there? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
12 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Questions like who are you? Do I know you? Don’t we usually ask things like 
where are you from? What do you do? Those questions – who, where, what, 
how – are pretty much a fundamental ritual, at least in our society, on how 
people first make that contact and how they indirectly unconsciously 
designate what the social contract is going to be for the next interaction. Isn’t 
that the case? 
 
I’d like you to have an experience of that right now. The first way of 
experiencing that would be to just stand up. Then if you have a look around 
the room, you’ll notice there is fair number of people in here, and all you 
need to do is walk around and shake their hand. You have the ideas pretty 
much set for you already. The nice part of tradition is you know what’s going 
to come next. 
 
So, just have a chat with them – how are you, who are you, where are you 
from, what do you do? Seeing as we’re here to do hypnosis or hypnotic 
language or Mind Bending Language, and seeing as those are very routine 
questions, what I’m going to encourage you to do is simply pay attention to 
the quality of the response that you get.  
 
I don’t really care what they say. I’m sure it would be very interesting and 
they’ll create a nice rapport with you and that will be great. What I’m more 
interested in is how are they responding to your questions? Can you notice a 
difference between different people? 
 
With that idea in mind, I’d like for you to get a chance to meet all 200 people 
in this room right now. This is true. I know you can get carried away with it 
and talk a while because some people are very interesting, so to make sure 
you’re not stressed or under any kind of time pressure, I think seven minutes 
is enough to meet everyone. Off you go. 
 
Welcome back. How was that? Was it fun? Now I’m hoping that you all 
noticed there’s a certain quality, a certain level of responses you’re getting, 
one which is hopefully once again not particularly surprising in a social 
gathering where people have something in common. You have a group 
identity because you’re here to learn the same things and so on. 
 
So, you’re friendly, a little chatty, you hear their names, you hear the towns, 
you hear the name of a profession and that sort of stuff. What I’d like you to 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
13 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
do now is really ask the same kind of questions again. We’ll just change the 
order slightly, which will make more sense as we go along.  
 
Of course those of you who have already watched the DVD’s know about that 
already. We’re going to change the order slightly. These are more or less the 
same questions that you asked. One of them is a little bit twisted, unless of 
course someone’s fallen over and banged their head. 
 
There’s no magic in the question, is there? These are questions that you 
pretty much pretty already asked: 
 
Who are you? 
Where are you? 
What are you? 
When are you? 
How are you? 
 
Some sound a little bit more weird like what are you – what does that mean? 
When are you is not the most usual question you ask, unless someone’s had a 
blow to the head or something like that. However, the magic is not so much in 
the question. The magic has to be in how the question is perceived, does it 
not? 
 
So, you could ask someone who are you, and they’ll answer it in one 
particular way. You could ask someone who are you really, and they’ll answer 
in a different way. Someone might decide for example to answer the question 
who are you in the socially appropriate way, which is to give their name. I’m 
Jack or Jill.  
 
Your job is to be creative in finding ways around that so that they reevaluate 
that question in a different light. To give you a little hint in terms of the 
pattern, it’s very simple.  
 
Who are you? My name is Jack. That’s very nice. It’s nice to meet you, Jack. 
So, Jack is your name but who are you really, or are you just a name? Of 
course I’m not just a name. Well then who are you? As soon as that has 
happened, once they’ve gone past that socially appropriate response, you will 
see a change in their reaction, in the way that they answer you.

I would like for you to take note of that change so that we can discuss that 
afterwards. Does the exercise make sense to you? Once again, I’d like for you 
to do it with at least three or four people, but if you get to do it with the 
whole room in the next five minutes, you are superheroes.  
 
Remember, the magic is not in the question. The magic is in how they 
perceive the question to be other than how they would normally perceive it 
to be.  
 
Find out how you can do that, find out the responses you get and experiment 
a little bit in terms of your approach so that we can discuss all these things 
afterwards, and that’s going to be the backbone to the rest of the day. Spend 
seven minutes doing that. Off you go. 
 
Welcome back. How was that? Was that interesting? Did you notice a 
distinctive difference between asking essentially the same sort of questions 
the first time in a social context and then doing something to somehow break 
that social expectation and you’re getting a different quality of response? 
Would that be fair to say? 
 
Now I’d like to have a chat with you to see what kinds of distinctions you 
noticed so we can talk about those because they will be really important in 
terms of the work we do going forward. If we miss this point, then all we’re 
doing is using clever language that makes you sound like you’re an idiot, and 
I’m not too sure that’s what you came for. 
 
What kinds of things did you notice? What kinds of things did you do 
differently or what kind of response did you notice? Just stand up so we can 
get a mic over to you.  
 
Student: Hi. It was like sort of breaking through a shell. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: Like you get the social stuff and you’re at this level, but there’s still kind of a 
barrier between you and you’re just exchanging pleasantries. I felt this for 
both of us, while I was asking the question as he responds. The shell was gone 
and we were into a much deeper level of interaction.

Igor: 
Thank you. Did anyone else notice that sort of thing? This is important. This is 
technically known as breaking the ice in some ways, but what you’ve just 
discovered – and you can see the differences even though you may or may 
not know how to describe that yet. That’s less important to be able to 
describe it. Noticing it is the important part. 
 
 
You can see the difference between what we will call for the moment a 
conscious response and an unconscious response. When you get a purely 
conscious response, that’s a social ritual. You know what it is. It’s like yes this 
is safe, this is a good answer.  
 
 
As soon as that shell gets popped, you have some genuine unconscious 
content coming in with that. Just to follow on the same point, how many of 
you noticed that the quality of information you got from that point forward 
was significantly better than the first time around? Put your hands up. That’s 
excellent. 
 
 
This is why we do Mind Bending Language. It is not to confuse people. It’s not 
to mess with people. It’s not like oh look, I’m a funky hypnotist and I can do all 
this stuff. It may be how you start but really the reason we’re doing this is 
because really a simple definition of hypnosis – taking all the technical aspects 
out – is a simple direct communication with someone else’s unconscious 
mind. 
 
 
As soon as you’ve accessed the unconscious material, you’re a hypnotist 
because you tell the unconscious mind wouldn’t it be fun if that hand stuck to 
the wall and you couldn’t move it? As long as you’re talking directly to the 
unconscious mind and the conscious mind has no interference with it, it will 
be stuck. 
 
 
Does it matter if you did an instant crazy induction or you did some Street 
Hypnosis or you told a story or you did something else? No. What matters is 
that the unconscious mind can do all these things, and that’s what we’re 
trying to get to. 
 
 
Thank you. That was a wonderful realization. That’s a great way to start the 
whole thing off. Again, stand up and put your hand up. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I was just going to say it’s kind of awkward to segue into something like that.

Igor: 
Absolutely. 
 
Student: When it works, it works but sometimes it’s hard to segue into it. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Let me just take that point a little step further. Did anyone else 
notice that as well? It’s kind of like shyness or it was embarrassing, like oh I’m 
about to do something. Alright, I’ll just do it then. What do you think is going 
on there? What is that?  
 
Student: What the first gentleman said about getting into the shell, it was the coming 
up against the shell.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you. That’s exactly it. What is the purpose of that shell? It’s an 
emotional protection mechanism, isn’t it? I don’t know you. I don’t know how 
much I can trust you. I don’t know what to do or say. I don’t know if I’ll be 
embarrassed in front of you. I don’t know if I’ll do the wrong thing and you’ll 
judge me harshly because of it.  
 
 
These are all the things that are going on in the back of our minds. It’s a nice 
evolution from where it used to be, which is I don’t know you, I don’t know if 
you’re going to kill me and take my stuff away from me. I mean that’s kind of 
where this whole thing started from. It’s a defense mechanism, which had a 
valuable place. 
 
 
Even in modern societies, it still has a valuable place because they may not 
stab you and take your wallet – or maybe they will, I don’t know – but you 
may say something that will get you judged harshly and have social 
consequences, and those are the things that are in the back of our minds. 
 
 
Yet we must penetrate through that barrier to do what we want to be doing 
as hypnotists. There are two things going on. One is that as the hypnotist you 
have a little bit of performance anxiety – I’m about to step outside of the 
normal social role, what do I do with that? 
 
 
On the other side we have the receiving end of it, which is something is being 
expected of me that I’m not sure if I’m ready to do yet. It’s okay by the way. 
People will withdraw from that. We will in time look at how to deal with that 
eloquently.

Right now and really for the rest of the day we’re going to be doing this 
clumsily, clunkily and mechanically purely to get the big pieces that we need 
to work with into the right place.  
 
 
Once we have those in place, then we can talk about subtlety. We can talk 
about pre-framing, opening the frame and moving into it smoothly and 
smoothing out that rough gap, but there’s no point in trying to smooth that 
rough gap if the place you’re smoothing things out to doesn’t exist. 
 
 
It’s like building a bridge into nothing. Right now we’re finding out what does 
the territory look like and what places do we need bridges on? Thank you. 
That’s a great observation and something we’ll be dealing with more.  
 
 
Is it okay with you to just carry on with this particular process knowing that 
that shell will pop out every now and again, and you’ll just simply bulldoze 
through it a little bit knowing that this is a relatively safe environment? It will 
help you out a lot, especially when we get into the more advanced stuff that 
we’re talking about. 
 
 
The final point I want to make on this particular subject is it very quickly 
demonstrates to you – and you should all recognize this when I say it – that 
hypnosis is anything but a casual relationship.  
 
 
As soon as you do something even vaguely hypnotic – in other words asking 
for a deeper response, a more unconscious response – we feel that sense of 
intimacy beginning to develop, and that’s another reason for that shell. So, 
that’s part of what you’re experiencing there as well. 
 
 
This is also important to realize because Mind Bending Language in particular 
is something you use to solve problems with. If there’s no problem, then you 
don’t use it.  
 
 
Otherwise you’re like the carpenter who just discovered how to use a 
hammer and starts using it everywhere, including on people’s fingers and 
heads just because hey, I have this crazy hammer. Look, it hurts, doesn’t it?  
 
 
That’s what happens when you get over enthusiastic with things like Mind 
Bending Language and you do it all the time. You hand the bus driver your 
money. He says that’s twenty cents. So, what’s more than twenty cents that 
it’s not? He says okay will you please step off the bus?

It is a temptation. I know everyone kind of falls into it every now and again 
because it’s fun. I just want to warn you about this because there are the 
learning aspects where anything goes pretty much, and there’s the actual 
utility aspects of it where it’s supposed to be totally seamless, invisible and 
fluid and no one knows it’s going on.  
 
 
It just means like gosh darn it they like you, and they want to feel like they’re 
opening up to you and they can trust you and all these other things are 
happening. You need to understand that there are times to do it and there are 
times when doing it would actually be counterproductive because you’re 
asking for too much too soon. 
 
 
Is that something that you can kind of track back in terms of the experiences 
you’ve had? So, just keep that in the back of your mind just so you can use 
this stuff eloquently when we get through the whole paradigm, if you like. 
 
 
That’s enough of me talking. There are a whole bunch of other hands up. Do 
you want to stand up and put your hands up?  
 
Student: A couple of observations that I made while I was doing it, and I think you just 
hit on a lot of those points. First I had to interrupt my own standard pattern of 
questions in order to be comfortable in asking those, and then I tried it two 
different ways.  
 
 
One was just very mechanical, just asking the question as I was reading it off 
the list. Then I tried it by changing my state first and then asking the question 
the same way but with a different internal state. 
 
Igor: 
Can you demonstrate it to us so that people can actually see what you mean? 
 
Student: So, you walk up to someone and just say when are you? What are you? How 
are you? 
 
Igor: 
Which version is that – conscious, mechanical, clumsy? That’s just thinking the 
language is like something out of Harry Potter. It’s a magic spell and just 
saying the words will do the work, which is not the case, right? Then how 
might you shift it around? 
 
Student: Then you might shift your internal state and say, so when are you?

Igor: 
Did you notice a difference there? It’s socially much more appropriate. It’s like 
oh he really wants an answer to this. It demands a different level of response 
from you, which is why it comes out. Thank you for that. I really appreciate 
that. 
 
Student: I think that in my own experience if you are humorous and you don’t take 
yourself seriously, you are immediately intimate with the other person. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. 
 
Student: But if you take yourself very seriously, then you naturally sound very stupid. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, it goes back to the masks that we wear. I’m asking you to do something 
that chances are most of you don’t do on a daily basis, so it doesn’t fit the 
mask you currently use, which means the only way you can do this is by 
involving enough of your own unconscious mind to make it work because it’s 
novel, it’s fresh, it’s different and that’s why it works. 
 
 
I’ll give you another prediction, if I may. Once you get very good with Mind 
Bending Language where this stuff is just so natural that it’s second nature to 
you, there may come a point at which you’re just throwing it out there again 
and you’ll catch yourself saying hang on a second, I put nothing into that. 
 
 
It will work decently because you’ve got a lot of other things in the right place 
but if you’re not there, why should they be? I’m not talking about your 
conscious mind, by the way. Thank you. That’s a great realization.  
 
Student: I noticed that the quality of listening to the answer was very different. 
 
Igor: 
So, when you were asking the question, you actually listened differently as 
well because you got a more, shall we say, genuine response perhaps? Would 
that be fair? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. This is also very important. We’re not feigning a relationship here, 
folks. We’re creating one. This is something that I think Milton Erickson put in 
the most charming way, as he does often. Ernest Rossi was interviewing him 
and was asking him why he asked those questions, because he asked some 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
20 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
interesting psychotherapeutic questions of a lady, and he said, because I was 
interested.  
 
 
He said, oh you mean you were interested in creating a rapport and showing 
that you value her relationship and that the symbolic meaning of her 
communication would be respected and so on, and Erickson said no, I was 
interested in her. 
 
 
I think the fundamental currency of interaction is that level of interest, that 
emotional energy that you invest in it. If you put no emotional energy into 
that, why on Earth should they? Where do emotions come from? Are they a 
consciously chosen thing, or do they arise from an unconscious set of 
processes? Unconscious, right? 
 
 
Another way of saying this is if you’re not willing to be unconscious enough to 
communicate with them, why should they bother to be unconscious in their 
communications back to you? Do you see where we’re going with this? Thank 
you for that. That was excellent. Are there any other things you noticed? 
 
Student: I noticed – and I’m not sure if maybe because the crowd has already been 
primed to expect the same responses we are – but when you break through 
that shell and ask a question that gets to a much deeper level of expected 
response, because of the social contract you mentioned earlier, it seems like 
immediately that is turned around and expected from you in your further 
questions and/or your answer, which almost seems counterproductive if 
you’re trying to influence someone else and then all of a sudden they’re 
wanting the same information that you’re asking from them. 
 
Igor: 
I agree with everything you said up until that last point. If you’re a human 
being and you’re alive, you’re influencing someone else and being influenced 
by them. That is our nature. Just because you’re trying to influence someone 
else, why on Earth wouldn’t you want them to influence you back?  
 
 
Who’s to say that you don’t come up with something better as a result? This 
has more to do with what we’ll come onto over the next four days when we 
talk about Mind Bending Language for influence.  
 
 
If you want to create a win-win scenario, how on Earth do you know it’s going 
to be a win-win if you don’t know what’s inside their mind? How are they 
going to know what’s going to go back to you unless they know what’s in your 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
21 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
mind? How can they evaluate you as an entity unless they know what’s going 
on inside of you? 
 
 
It’s only respectful as far as I’m concerned to allow them in enough to 
influence you also. The key difference here is going to be - by influence I do 
not mean domination. I don’t mean to be forcing something onto someone. 
They do not have to change your mind, your opinion, ideas or even behavior.  
 
 
However, they do need to have an opportunity to have their point of view 
respected and to have you acknowledge it, to be influenced by it even if the 
influence is simply that it’s an acceptable point of view, or I can see how that 
works for you. This will make more sense as we go along, especially 
tomorrow. Today it’s less important. 
 
 
The only thing I would say is I would encourage you to explore what happens 
when you do let that interaction continue and open up to them as you go 
back. There is of course – and this is going beyond the consciousness of here – 
something that will be important, is you have to bear in mind who you’re 
talking to and in what context and so on. 
 
 
If you walk up to a police officer who’s asking you questions and you suddenly 
just bare your soul – oh I’ve had a terrible week – he’ll say sir I was just asking 
you to move along please.  
 
 
So, there are times and places and levels of influence within the exchange. 
There are layers, it’s not just an open and closed book. There are layers within 
which those openings happen, and you need to be aware of that too. Does 
that help? Does that make sense? Are there any other comments or questions 
on that? 
 
 
So, we have some pretty simple questions, which we made interesting by the 
way that we communicated them because the impact ends up being different. 
Would that be fair to say?  
 
Adding “Not” 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like to do now is exactly the same process again, only I want you to 
go a little bit further. You can ask the same kind of questions in any order – I 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
22 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
really don’t mind. You’re welcome to ask them clumsily and mechanically as 
you did before, more consciously and contrast it to the unconscious version. 
 
 
There’s only one thing I want you to add to this, which is again going to go to 
the heart of Mind Bending Language and it’s not in the way that you might 
think at first.  
 
 
It’s not for the reasons you may think at first, although it’s okay for you to 
misunderstand it at the beginning. You get to decide for yourself whether or 
not you’ve got the misunderstanding now, not knowing what I’m talking 
about yet. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do is add to those questions the simple word ‘not.’ Who 
are you not? Where are you not? You can even compare that to where aren’t 
you, and see if there’s a difference in their responses. 
 
 
Who are you not? 
Where are you not? 
When are you not? 
How are you not? 
 
 
So, you have different ways you can ask it. You have different places you can 
put the ‘not’ in. I don’t care what happens too much. All I care about at this 
level is that you observe something else going on when you add just one word 
in the same meaningful way that you’ve been doing the other things. 
 
 
We’ll talk about that a little bit more and that will be the foundation for some 
interesting Mind Bending Language spins. Are there any questions on that? Is 
that pretty easy? Take five minutes to talk to about a dozen people or so. Off 
you go. 
 
 
What did you notice when you just added that one little word with all the 
stuff you’ve been doing so far already? We’ve not really done very much yet, 
have we? In terms of actual learning crazy language or anything like that, it’s 
nothing particularly elaborate.  
 
 
Yet already things are beginning to shift, aren’t they? At least stuff is 
happening. What is that? What are you noticing? Hands up.

Student: I found that going back to the beginning and to now, that this one word made 
it more awkward.  
 
Igor: 
It made it more awkward for you to deliver, yes? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent, and how was it in the receiving end? 
 
Student: I think I can only explain by how I answered the question when it was given to 
me. I had to refer to what am I not? What is my nationality not? 
 
Igor: 
It sent your mind spinning on a search for something, yes? 
 
Student: Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Now let’s talk about this a little bit before we carry on because this 
is an important stage. Right now I have done you a slight disservice in the 
interest of building something else, which means I have made you socially 
inept.  
 
 
Seriously, who goes up to someone at a party and says hey who aren’t you? 
Ha-ha, gotcha. That is really the domain of the socially inept in many ways, so 
please don’t take anything we’re doing this morning in particular as an 
encouragement for you to do this out in the real world with real people who 
may just think you’re very, very strange. 
 
 
This is purely and simply a set of exercises to start building up in a gross way 
some experiences, which we’ll later refine and use as an actual hypnotic 
influencing sort of communication, but I can’t get to the subtlety until you 
have the rough and ready version there to polish up. 
 
 
I can’t remember who it was – Michelangelo or someone like that. You know 
the old story when they asked him how did you carve the statue of David, and 
he said oh, it’s simple. I get a block of stone and I see the statue of David 
inside it, and I just chip away all the excess. 
 
 
So, we need to actually start quarrying for a big block of stone at first and 
then we’ll chip away the excess. That’s kind of where we are right now. Yes,

I’m not surprised if your social radar kicks in and says this is really clumsy 
because you’re right. It is really clumsy, until it’s not. 
 
 
This is related to this. Who here noticed that even just adding that little word 
‘not’ made it very difficult to actually give a verbal response, an actual 
answer? Did anyone notice that? You try and it’s like what the heck do they 
mean? This is meaningless.  
 
 
Did anyone think about that, like it was meaningless and your mind was ready 
to switch off and go this doesn’t make sense, and you kind of switched off? 
Did anyone do that?  
 
 
Then someone said this doesn’t make sense, and then they asked it again and 
it’s like yes I guess they’re serious about this, so I better think about this a 
little bit. I don’t know what sense it’s supposed to make, but it’s not really 
making any sense. 
 
 
Would that be kind of your thought process? That’s perfect because you’re 
just discovering the distinction between someone who is about to ignore your 
Mind Bending Language – the maneuver – the effect you were supposed to 
have is just about to be sidelined, and you can notice it happening.  
 
 
Can you see it when people are about to say yes but no, that doesn’t make 
sense? Can you see their response when that happens? Can you see that it’s a 
different response when you insist? Now I realize you don’t quite know how 
to answer this yet, but when are you not? What the heck does he mean? It 
doesn’t make any sense. 
 
 
Am I not in a different place now? And you can see the physical expression of 
the most important part of any influence process occurring, which is now 
they’ve started to think. Now I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself. We’ll 
cover this again more tomorrow and going forwards, but don’t confuse two 
different things. 
 
 
Just because you happen to have a thought, do not for a second believe that 
you’re actually thinking. This distinction is key and we will elaborate on that in 
the actual proper portion of the training, but right now you’re beginning to 
get a sense of this, aren’t you?

There are times when you’re not thinking this doesn’t make sense. There’s a 
time when you’re trying to think, which is actually thinking even though 
nothing’s coming out, and there’s a time you think you thought because 
you’ve given an answer, but it’s not the right one.  
 
 
That’s because you were having a thought and you’re sharing it rather than 
actually thinking it through, and you’re beginning to develop a relatively 
rough, but a sense of how to distinguish what’s going on in someone’s mind 
because if you don’t know what’s going on inside their mind, how on Earth 
are you going to influence them? Seriously. 
 
Student: Well, I was actually going to say something really similar because I noticed 
that each time it caught both of us off guard, and although sometimes it is 
really awkward, sometimes it was actually really captivating because you 
could almost see the pop on the person’s face, like you completely cracked 
through their shell. 
 
Igor: 
Did anyone notice this? The amount of awkwardness we’ve introduced was 
balanced by an equal amount of shall we say depth, going through their shell 
when it did. We don’t quite know what we did yet to break through that shell. 
That’s not the purpose of today. That is irrelevant. 
 
 
It is enough that you just by sheer dumb luck stumble into it from time to 
time and are smart enough to notice because if you don’t notice, they sure as 
heck won’t. So, you have to be able to notice these things and that is exactly 
the point. 
 
 
Did anyone else notice this by the way? Although it got awkward at some 
points, the actual quality of the result was that much better when it did work, 
although it wasn’t always. Would that be fair to say? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I think one of the most important things I discovered is that it’s actually 
making people conscious and in the present moment, which means they’re 
going to be alert to what their mind is thinking, whether they’re 
uncomfortable or not, but now they have power being in the present. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly, and actually I’ll take that a step further. This is great because you’re 
already into my day two or three material in some ways here. It’s interesting. 
As a hypnotist, there’s a prejudice in our profession that we want people to 
not be conscious. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
26 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
That’s only because we want a non-conscious response, but who’s to say that 
you can’t have a non-conscious response while they’re consciously active 
enough to realize it’s happening?  
 
 
What we care about is that non-conscious response, and what we want to 
bypass are those things that prevent that non-conscious response from 
arising, and it’s not consciousness. It’s a particular way of using consciousness 
that blocks that process. 
 
 
Honestly, when we come onto tomorrow’s material and the day after that, 
you’ll really enjoy this because Mind Bending Language for influence looks 
very different to any other kind of hypnosis. It has to.  
 
 
Let’s take a sales situation. If you have a new client come in and they’re sitting 
there in the chair like this, and at the end of the day they buy the car or 
whatever it is you have to sell to them, they’ll go home and go what 
happened? I have no clue. I just signed the contract, I have the car and I don’t 
even know what it is. 
 
 
Is that a useful sales situation to have? No. When potential clients are afraid 
to come and even shake your hand, you create anti-influence at that point. In 
order for this stuff to become useful, it has to become so smooth, so 
seamless, so invisible that nobody who doesn’t know what they’re looking for 
will ever recognize it, and that’s one of the reasons why I’m asking you to 
pause any preconceptions you have about what hypnosis is because whatever 
you think it is, it can’t be that for this.  
 
 
Otherwise it will not fit anywhere and in any useful context. Thank you for 
that. That’s going to be a key piece as we go forward.  
 
Student: I noticed that if you look at their eyes when you’re saying who are you, it’s 
like talking to a robot, but as soon as you add the ‘not’ it’s as if you tasered 
them. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s go taser some people. What do you think is going on there? What do you 
think is happening? You all recognized the symptom, yes? So, what do you 
think is going on? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
27 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: I think we have so many automatic responses that are built in and we just fire 
them off without even thinking, so now we have to stop these automatic 
responses and actually come up with something new. 
 
Igor: 
Are you beginning to appreciate the difference between having a thought and 
actually thinking?  
 
Student: It’s kind of the same thing. For me there was a gap between that automatic 
thinking and just being aware of that gap. I don’t know of that’s utilization of 
that gap but there was definitely a gap there. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. It’s something that happens, and there’s a way that you can predictably 
get to that point, only the question now is what is it that happened? Why 
does that ‘not’ sometimes do it just like that, and why does it sometimes not? 
 
 
What’s going on there? That’s the question that you really should have in the 
back of your mind because that’s the one we’ll be primarily answering 
partially today, but really when we get into the main content starting 
tomorrow. We’ll take one last comment over here and then we’ll move on. 
 
Student: My impression is that there is almost a moment of disorientation. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: A disorientation and that person suddenly goes internal big time on an 
internal search of some sort, and when you add the ‘not,’ suddenly you’ve 
ratcheted up that level of the internal search and disorientation and 
everything. 
 
Igor: 
You know what? Do you want me to jump the gun a little bit and give you a 
little more in terms of what’s going on there because you guys are noticing 
stuff that I was hoping to come to by the end of the day, so we may as well 
start with this seeing as you’re there now? Is that okay with you to jump the 
gun a bit? 
 
 
I guess it means you’re just an advanced class, which is useful given that this is 
Advanced Mind Bending Language, right?

The Agreement Reversal 
 
Igor: 
The effect that you’re noticing here is what I call the agreement reversal.  
 
 
If you recall from those of you who watched the Advanced Covert Hypnosis 
DVD’s, at the heart of the method is a little part of your brain called the 
amygdala, which sits in the limbic system and really talks between your 
reptilian brain – the base – and your prefrontal cortex, your neo-cortex, which 
is the thing that makes us be able to plan, think ahead and really have all the 
wonderful traits that we have as human beings. 
 
 
It’s a switching mechanism, and one of the things it does is it amps up 
emotions, but one of the things that it can do is it can shut off automatic 
thought loops. It actually shuts down the whole neo-cortex, if necessary.  
 
 
What we’re trying to do is to stimulate that part of the brain in a way that will 
allow us to burst through routines, habitual patterns of thinking or, more 
appropriately given the context that we’ve been using the word here, habitual 
patterns of thought so they can be freed up to start thinking again. 
 
 
Right there you have the key to all influence. Every single time you need to 
influence someone, it’s because you need to transform a thought into 
thinking and that’s what we’re doing here.  
 
 
How does the agreement reversal work? Well, in this case we set an 
expectation. Hey, who are you… not? It catches us by surprise and that’s one 
of the greatest ways to trigger the amygdala. We don’t understand how to 
make sense out of that question. 
 
 
As you were doing the exercise, one of you came up to me and said what the 
heck does ‘when are you’ mean? It doesn’t mean anything. It’s true. It is not a 
socially understood question.  
 
 
The question does mean something. It orients you in time, does it not? But it 
doesn’t mean anything to you because it doesn’t fit into the regular 
categories that you understand. It’s not a question that you’re asked on a 
daily basis. 
 
 
Now there will be some languages where asking ‘when are you’ may well be 
very appropriate because it’s socially a custom. It’s a tradition. There are 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
29 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
some language where asking how are you is a bizarre thing. Why the heck 
would you ask how are you? What do you mean how am I? I am. It’s just me. 
 
 
We’re bursting through cultural expectations, so by asking how are you… not, 
all you’re doing is you’re piggybacking on an expectation. Oh yeah, I know 
where this is going. How are you? I’m about to give you the answer and then 
the ‘not’ comes in and you go oh, did I misunderstand him? I’ve got to do 
some thinking now. 
 
 
That’s where you open the window of opportunity for influence. Now we 
don’t need to exploit it right now. We’re not going to do very much with it. 
We’ll do a little bit with it, but we’re not going to look at how to do it 
eloquently and invisibly and smoothly and all that sort of stuff because that’s 
not why we’re here today. 
 
 
We’re going to do it clumsily, clunkily and with as much social ineptness as 
you wish to. Glorify in that because all we’re interested in is catching those 
moments and you are, which is why we can talk about this stuff now. Does 
this all make sense? 
 
 
One last comment here and then we’ll move along to the final exercise before 
the break. 
 
Student: Most instant inductions involve some sort of a tug or a sudden sharp 
movement. 
 
Igor: 
It’s the same principle. 
 
Student: That’s what I was asking. This sounds like exactly the same thing, a PGA spike. 
 
Igor: 
This is one of the breakthroughs I had with Mind Bending Language in my own 
personal experience of it. I always wanted to have a method. This is why Mind 
Bending Language works so quickly by the way. I always wanted a method 
that would allow you to induce trances as quickly as an instant induction, but 
ones that are socially acceptable in any setting. 
 
 
That’s what Mind Bending Language does. It allows you to do the equivalent 
of an instant induction but in such a socially acceptable way that no one 
knows that it’s happening. That’s going to be the key.

If you want to be using this for influence, you’ve got to be covert about this 
because even if you’re semi-covert – in other words they kind of know 
something’s going on – then you’re dealing with defense mechanisms. We’ll 
get into that sort of stuff later, and that’s something you don’t want to be 
dealing with. 
 
 
The point at which it’s a pure joy is when you’re influencing people in a 
positive way. The ethics of it is going to be very important. We’ll talk about 
that when we actually get to the influencing part. Right now we’re just having 
fun. 
 
 
The ethics is crucial because without it you are really creating a big mess for 
yourself, but the ethics is something you have to carry with yourself. In other 
words, you have to do this covertly and still maintain your ethics so that the 
unconscious mind responds to you appropriately.  
 
 
It’s an interesting grey area in terms of ethics and morality. Each one of you 
will find yourself at a slightly different point. What I will do as time goes by is 
I’ll elucidate the points at which you have to do some thinking, and I will warn 
you of the consequences of coming down on the wrong side of the ethical 
debate. 
 
 
Let’s put it this way. People may not know what’s going on when something 
happens covertly, but they will always know the consequences of what 
happened, and you’ll be dealing with the consequences too.  
 
 
That’s part of where the ethics comes in apart from the fact it’s the right thing 
to do. So, there are two reasons. There’s the selfish reason and the altruistic 
reason.  
 
 
On that happy note, let’s do something with this now. You’ve already asked 
some simple basic questions. We really don’t have to change much on the 
board. We’ve thrown one word in, which has already just amped everything 
up. The awkwardness amps up as does the breakthrough moment, whichever 
you happen to get.  
 
 
You have a clue as to how to get that breakthrough moment with this idea of 
agreement reversal, although you’re not entirely sure yet how to apply that 
consistently and so on. And how could you? We haven’t really done anything 
with it yet. You’ve just discovered it.

You can recognize it when it happens, but you don’t necessarily know how to 
make it happen on purpose yet and that’s okay. That’s just where we are right 
now. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do now is to have an experience of bridging that gap 
between thought and thinking where influence kicks in, and it’s going to be 
very simple. You’re going to do exactly the same exercise again, the same five 
questions – any of them in any order, as many or as few as you wish.  
 
 
To make matters easier, I’d like all of you to know that you do not need a 
verbal response for this to work. It’s unnecessary. I am now actually more 
interested in the nonverbal responses.  
 
 
The verbal responses might be interesting as well. We’ll deal with those things 
in due course, but I’m more interested in the nonverbal responses, which 
you’re already catching nicely. If the person is genuinely trying to answer the 
question, you’re in a good place.  
 
 
If they thought about it briefly and dismissed it, then you need to poke them – 
get your taser out if you like – and do it again until you get the right quality of 
response, and that’s the only thing I care about right now.  
 
 
Can you distinguish when someone’s not quite there yet and they need a little 
extra shove, or when they’re totally down the rabbit hole and going I have no 
idea what you’re doing to my brain? It kind of hurts but it kind of feels good 
too. So, you’re going to do the same questions. You can put the ‘not’ in or not. 
Now it’s going to be more of a surprise because you don’t know if it’s going to 
come or not. 
 
 
The only thing I want you to add now to this whole thing is I’d like you to put 
in a simple suggestion, just a simple idea. The one we used in the Advanced 
Covert Hypnosis DVD’s was the idea of being happy. Who are you… not… 
that’s happy? 
 
 
You can understand that that sounds different to who are you not that’s 
happy? There’s a difference, isn’t there? It’s in the punctuation, which comes 
out in the pauses. I’d like you to experiment with that without me saying too 
much about that.

If you wish to default to the idea of happiness, that’s a wonderful thing to do 
anyway, but if you wish to use something else as a trance theme, by all means 
do so. Useful things will be things like being happy, being relaxed, at ease, 
learning naturally, being masterful, feeling empowered.  
 
 
I really don’t care what it is. Choose something that is generally speaking 
positive and if you choose something other than happy, just bear in mind that 
your partners will give you feedback at the end of it whether or not what you 
chose was appropriate for them, so that might be a useful thing too. 
 
 
Does everyone have a vague enough sense of what the exercise is? To recap, 
you’re going to ask the same questions – who are you. You may or may not 
add the ‘not,’ and at the end of it all you’re going to do is present a very 
simple suggestion, preferably in the form of a simple one-word statement like 
who are you… not… that’s happy? Who are you… that’s learning easily? Who 
are you… not… that’s masterful now? And whatever else tickles your fancy at 
this point. 
 
 
Do you all have an idea of this? Spend five minutes apiece, just nice and quick. 
We’ll come back, we’ll debrief and then we’ll have a break. Off you go. 
 
 
How was that? Was that interesting? Let me ask you this. Are you beginning 
to notice a more extreme range of responses? In other words, with some 
things, it’s like this is silly and I really don’t know what to do with this, this is 
crazy and just leave me alone; and other ones are like yeah man that’s really 
deep man. 
 
 
Are you beginning to find yourselves being pushed to those edges more and 
more? Would that be fair to say? What do you think is going on here? What 
are we doing?  
 
Mind Bending Moments 
 
Igor: 
Let me put the question this way. How many of you think that what we’re 
suggesting that you should do here is say these questions to random 
passersby on the streets, to your staff and your clients? 
 
 
One of the students did a wonderful thing, a great experiment and learned a 
lot from this, where he runs a business and has staff and he goes up to his 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
33 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
staff and says Mary, who are you not that’s happy at work now? She goes 
what the heck are you going on about and walks off and carries on doing her 
work, because what’s missing? Any ideas? A context, right? 
 
 
You need to let them know how to process this information. Mind Bending 
Language is actually a misnomer. It has nothing to do with the language. The 
language is a vehicle. It’s a tool for achieving something. Would you like to 
know what the correct term really should be? It’s mind bending moments.  
TM, thank you very much. We have bought the website already, so don’t even 
try it.  
 
 
At our last Ericksonian hypnosis training, one of the exercises we played is 
called the Dr. Unconscious. So, he comes up to me the next day and says I just 
bought Dr. Unconscious, Dr. hyphen Unconscious and every other possible 
permutation. If you want it, I’ll sell it to you for $10,000.  
 
 
These are training wheels designed to get you to just notice different qualities 
of responses that you’re getting. There should be three main types of 
responses that you can get in a broad brushstroke notice: 
 
1. The glib response. 
 
 
They actually answer. They have an answer ready for you. Who are you that’s 
happy? Oh yeah, I’m always happy. Was there even a modicum of thought 
involved in that? Was there any kind of brain power necessary for that? No, 
that’s a stock answer and that is essentially useless to you.  
 
 
That was a failed attempt. It’s not a big deal because you can still utilize that – 
and we’ll come to that in due course – but you know that you’ve basically had 
a dud response.  
 
2. Another kind of response is people saying it just doesn’t make sense. 
Say that again. 
 
 
Do you kind of notice that kind of question? Doesn’t it feel like the wheels are 
spinning inside your mind? They’re not quite connecting. The gears aren’t 
actually grabbing on. You’re desperately trying to make it attach to something 
but it’s not there yet. Would that be fair to say is kind of a description of 
what’s going on? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
34 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
3. There’s a third kind of response, which is yeah I know this doesn’t 
make sense. You’re an idiot. 
 
 
Do you ever get that kind of response? They’re trying to make sense and they 
say I don’t know what you mean by that. What do you mean? They’re seeking 
clarification.  
 
 
That third kind of response is particularly interesting. The first and the last 
response – the yeah, I’ve got an answer for you – that’s just a routine answer. 
It’s already been prefabricated for them in some way or another. It’s 
essentially useless for the influence process. I’ll show you how to break 
through that in due course. 
 
 
That last kind of answer, because we’re doing this in a clumsy way and you’re 
trying to make sense of it in a normal social context, it doesn’t fit. So, your 
mind goes to the default pattern with things that don’t fit, which is to dismiss 
it. Oh, I can’t think of this. Forget it. It’s not important. If I can’t make sense of 
it in two seconds or less, it can’t be important.  
 
 
What I invite you to do just for the purposes of the exercises here is to 
understand that no actual verbal response is required of you, and as a 
corollary of that no internal verbal response is required either. You need to 
have no moment of insight, like oh wow this is so amazing, I know what he 
means now. 
 
 
Some of you will get that. You’ll say oh that’s genius, how did you know to ask 
that? But that will be random at this stage. All I care about is can you notice 
those spinning wheels inside your mind and still remain there long enough, 
engage with the question attempting to answer it for that process to continue 
without dismissing it? 
 
 
That’s the point at which you actually get to grow your own mind. You get to 
move it into places which you’ve never even been able to think about before, 
never even been able to conceive of before. You’re in a whole new world at 
that point.  
 
 
When the mind spins like that, that’s when you know you’re on the cusp of it. 
In terms of doing this in a clumsy sort of way or in a clunky sort of way, it’s 
easy to dismiss it because let’s face it it’s not something that fits the social 
context.

However, once you can get someone to that place and recognize it, and once 
you can allow yourself to be there as well in terms of what we’re doing here, 
then everything we do to build off of this – starting tomorrow with the actual 
influential elements – will make sense and will make bypassing that problem 
very easy. 
 
 
We’re going to use the very mechanism that wants them to dismiss the idea 
as a way of actually deepening the trance that they’re getting into, but we 
can’t get there until you can recognize where they’re at because you’ll have to 
do different things based on what kind of responses you’re getting. 
 
 
If you can’t recognize the response between I’m right there, my mind is 
spinning but I’m about to dismiss it; if you can’t spot that moment when 
they’re about to do it – that dismissing I mean – then you don’t know when to 
time the response that will break through. Do you see where we’re going with 
this? 
 
 
Let me ask you this. Can you all recognize the glib answer that is essentially 
useless? Did you all have at least one or two examples of that? Can you all 
recognize the bit where they’re in that – for want of a better word – that 
moment of wonder where they’re just really wondering about what does this 
mean, and they’re openly wondering about it?  
 
 
Can you all recognize that state of mind? I’ve modeled it for you a few times 
already. Can you all recognize the state of mind that could lead to that 
wondering sort of state but is being blocked by essentially a mental judgment 
saying I don’t know how to relate to this idea, I don’t know how to relate to 
the information, I don’t know what to make of the communications you’ve 
given me; therefore I will dismiss it because I don’t know how to deal with 
that at this point?  
 
 
Can you all recognize that kind of mindset too more or less? That’s going to be 
a crucial element in the influence game. If I ask you for directions to 
somewhere, I won’t know which way you’re going until you tell me.  
 
 
If I tell you to turn down one road and you say no that can’t be the right road 
and you keep walking, I know you’re walking the wrong way but unless I know 
that you just ignored my suggestion about which path to take, then I have no 
way of telling that you’re already on the wrong track and that I have to do 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
36 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
some backtracking before carrying on with my influence process because 
you’re not there. 
 
 
Hopefully, that all makes sense. Are there any comments or questions before 
we have a break? 
 
Student: I think it’s kind of a stun-gun effect. It’s like somebody has slapped you in the 
face. 
 
Igor: 
Hopefully that’s physically unappealing.  
 
Student: Yes, there’s a sort of choking feeling with it. I don’t know if it’s the loss of 
words or anything else. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. May I address that point actually because I guess this could be 
important, especially for those of you who are less experienced with this? This 
is actually an important point.  
 
 
Who here felt – and please be honest – deeply uncomfortable with that mind 
spinning, grasping for an answer and couldn’t quite get it? Who felt 
uncomfortable about that? Please be honest about it. That’s okay. 
 
 
Would you like to know where I believe that discomfort comes from? If you 
do that to a child, they don’t care. They’re having fun with it, until something 
happens. They go to school. What is school predicated upon?  
 
 
What is the fundamental principle of our current educational system – which 
actually is a misnomer because education has nothing to do with it? I’ll 
explain why if you want. I will happily wax lyrical about this point for a long 
time. 
 
 
What is the premise for school? There is one answer and if you don’t have it, 
you’re stupid. I have it. I’m the teacher. I know it all. If you mess about and if 
you come up with a different answer than the one I have in my mind, you’re 
wrong because I’m the teacher and I know. It’s not on the test and if it’s not 
on the test, then you must be wrong. 
 
 
So, the discomfort you’re feeling is your mind trying to find an answer 
because I’ve asked you a question, and if you cannot give me an answer to 
that question, you have years of programming inside your mind that you’re 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
37 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
about to be embarrassed, ridiculed, made to feel stupid or diminished either 
by your teacher or later on your peers in your classroom saying ha-ha you 
couldn’t get the answer and I knew the answer all along. 
 
 
That fear is what drives a deep discomfort, but the problem is this. How can 
you ever discover anything new if you’re not going through a place that you 
don’t know? By definition going through a place that you don’t know has to 
be the place to something new because if you already know it, then it can’t be 
new. It’s useless to you. It’s already there. 
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? So, initially it will be uncomfortable 
to some of you who have been – for want of a better word – more damaged 
by the educational system than others because you took it very seriously. You 
believed the lie they told you that it actually matters what you write down on 
the test. 
 
 
All the fear and panic you had when you were 12 years old taking your biology 
test, and the nights of disturbance you had before that, and all the beating up 
you gave yourself afterwards – does that have even an iota of value to you 
right now in your current life? Does that test mean anything? No, it has 
nothing to do with it.  
 
 
I could even go into standardized testing on a different rant if you want, but 
that’s not for right now. What is important right now is that in order to 
influence people, you need to understand that some people will be deeply 
troubled by the idea of going somewhere new because if they don’t have the 
answer ahead of time, they’re challenged.  
 
 
They’ve been damaged by the educational system to want to have the answer 
before they can feel safe and they need to go the other way, and you have to 
approach that process in a much more delicate way. Your influence process 
will slow down so that they have enough of the unknown that new things can 
occur, but they’re close enough to what is known that they’re not frightened 
by it. 
 
 
As you have more interactions over time, they learn to trust the unknown 
with you, so they’re willing to dive into it. How many of you have been on a 
live seminar with me before? Notice the hands around the room. How many 
of you in this last exercise felt pretty comfortable not having any clue what’s 
going on except that your mind’s spinning around? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
38 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
It’s mostly the same hands going up. Why is that? It’s because you have been 
learning something in terms of the live experiences with me to be able to do 
that.  
 
 
How many of you when you had your very first live experience with me were 
totally freaked out, like what the heck is going on here? Am I wrong? Is 
something wrong with me? I don’t understand anything that’s going on. Oh, 
panic. 
 
 
So, you’ve already gone through that process. I’ve already educated you with 
that. The rest of you may have seen it and said ha-ha that’s very funny, he’s a 
funny guy, he makes funny jokes. Now you get to experience what it’s like for 
yourself. It’s a little different, isn’t it? That’s why it works. 
 
 
There are a lot of variables that we have to deal with when it comes to the 
influence game, and we’re just exposing ourselves to these right now so that 
we can get used to them.  
 
 
We’ll carry on with this clunky questioning process for the rest of the day. I 
make no bones about this. There will be nothing smooth, eloquent or even 
practical about today. I promise. However, it will be the foundation to allow 
all that stuff you want to do with it to occur. 
 
 
If you want to have a pleasant learning experience, when you get that 
confusion part of your mind, that spinning around like you can’t make sense 
of it all, then realize that’s it. You’re there. Then you’ll go great, I’m here, and 
then carry on doing whatever you’re doing. Don’t stop. Don’t let that energy 
die down. 
 
 
If you want to go the other way with it and suffer, then beat yourself up all 
you want and remind yourself of your fifth grade teacher saying you can’t do 
this, you’ve got to give me an answer or else I’ll make fun of you, in which 
case that’s all on you. 
 
 
Really one way or the other, you will get the hang of this. It’s just a question 
of how pleasant you want to make it for yourself. Is that an agreement we can 
make going forward? We’ll have a break in a minute but when you get back 
into these things that don’t make sense at all, it is the attempt at making 
sense of it that is all that’s required of you. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

There is no conclusion required. There is no answer required. There is no 
response required. You do not even have to have an internal sense or 
certainty of knowing what’s going on.  
 
 
All that is required is a genuine effort to make sense of that question. If that 
happens, there is enough of your brain lit up in the right way for all this to 
work and that’s it.  
 
 
There is one last thing before we have a break. In hypnosis circles there’s the 
old adage that when someone says oh I’ll try this, and you say oh no don’t try. 
Do or do not. There is no try.  
 
 
Has anyone come across that before? Yoda was a wise man. However, he’s 
not quite right. The reason that in hypnosis circles or any influence circles 
when someone says try and why you should be on notice that something 
funky is going on is that usually when someone says I’ll try this, it becomes an 
emotional distancing when they think they will fail.  
 
 
They have an expectation of failure and to comfort themselves ahead of time, 
they’ll say oh I’ll just try it. Really they’re going in with the attitude of failure, 
and that’s the bit that we need to counteract.  
 
 
However, the actual attempt at doing something, just the act of trying 
something with frustrated failure at the end of it still changes your brain, and 
that’s what we’re interested in.  
 
 
There’s a great bit of research done by a neuroscientist who’s also a clinical 
psychiatrist or psychologist. He works with OCD – Obsessive Compulsive 
Disorder. You know where people have to lick a postage stamp five times 
before they can glue them on or they have to flick the light switch 10 times 
and all that sort of stuff, right? 
 
 
This is a real problem. There’s actually a neurological problem, it changes 
pathways in their brains. What he does is an ingenious bit of therapy. There’s 
a longer version of it but he does brain scans.  
 
 
He says to them over the next week or so I want you to just try to not flick 
that light switch, to not turn the oven on, to not check if you’ve locked the 
doors, to not lick your postage stamps too much. Just try. Even if you

ultimately fail, it’s irrelevant. Just the fact that you’ve tried is going to do 
something for you. 
 
 
Then week after week he shows them their brain scans when they come back, 
and do you know what happens? You can physically trace a change inside the 
brain. Their neurology starts changing just on the attempt, even though it 
always ended up in failure.  
 
 
Of course they get motivated by that and eventually they build enough 
pathways in their brain – new pathways in the architecture – that they can 
have an actual genuine response and ultimately overcome the obsessiveness. 
 
 
That’s all you need to do in here – a genuine attempt to make sense of the 
questions presented to you, including all the nuances in terms of how and 
when they pause and why they pause. A genuine attempt to make sense of 
that is all that is required of you.  
 
 
Even if the wheels are spinning, connections in your brain are being made, 
which will be the foundation for later sense to come. That’s when you’ve truly 
grown as a person. That’s what I hope for you.  
 
 
With that happy thought, let’s take a 15-minute break.

DVD 2 – Pacing People’s Reality & Unconscious 
Responses 
 
 
 
Igor: 
How are you doing? Is everyone good? Who’s having fun? Fun really is the 
biggest antidote to being too serious, and  not being too serious is the 
antidote to all those messed up things your teachers made you do at school, 
so good for you. A number of you have come up to me, seeing as we had that 
little segment where we talked about the educational system and so on. They 
were very interested in that and asked if I want to talk a little bit more about 
that.  
 
 
If you want me to talk more about that, please let me know because if enough 
of you do, I’ll make time for it. It’s not specifically part of what we’re doing 
here but it does feed into this whole idea of how to use Mind Bending 
Language and what to expect, so that can be a use of it. It’s just that we’ll 
elaborate in a different direction.  
 
 
Out of curiosity, is anyone interested in that as a rule? Okay, that’s probably 
enough that we can take some time later on. I’ll find a place to put that in that 
will be useful.  
 
 
For the moment, let’s go back to the core ideas. We had three core responses: 
 
1. The glib response. 
 
2. It’s happening but I don’t know what’s happening and I’m going to be 
afraid of it now because I don’t know how to respond. 
 
3. Oh my God it’s happening, this is so cool, I don’t know what it is but it 
feels good response. 
 
Those are really the three things you can get, and we need to know how to 
deal with those first two but it won’t be today. I’ll just make that very clear. If 
you see the first response, what do you think would be a simple answer to 
that? Any ideas? 
 
Student: Lead them to one you want. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
42 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Very close, lead them to the one you want. Actually it’s correct. 
 
Student: Just repeat the question. 
 
Igor: 
Just repeat the question. Oh, you misunderstand, I’m asking you who you are, 
I’m not asking for your name. Basically what I’m doing is I’m out-framing their 
response.  
 
 
Where are you? I’m in this room. Oh, you misunderstand. I wasn’t asking 
about your physical location right now. What I want to know is where are 
you? That doesn’t make sense. Now you’re getting there. What?  
 
 
Just really think about it. Where are you… not… that’s happy? What? Now 
you’ve moved them from one to the other. It is a genuine attempt at making 
sense of your question that is engaging those processes in the mind that we 
want. Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
 
If you’re making a genuine attempt to understand or process the question, 
you’re there. You’ve got it as an individual, or as a hypnotist seeing that, 
you’ve got it. Easy?  
 
sySTEM Questions 
 
Igor: 
Again, those of you who have listened to the DVD’s, you already have this as a 
background but there’s a pattern to these questions, isn’t there? There’s a 
very simple way for remembering them and this is just a mnemonic. I call 
them the sySTEMs questions just because the last few letters of it describe 
the four different ways that we kind of build our reality above. 
 
 
 
sySTEM 
 
 
S – Space 
 
 
T – Time  
 
 
E – Energy 
 
 
M – Matter  
 
 
The S stands for Space. Whenever we talk about something that we consider 
to be real it’s usually located in space somewhere, isn’t it?  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
43 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The T stands for Time. There’s usually a time at which it’s located in that 
space. It’s not always there necessarily. Even the pyramids at some point 
weren’t there, and I suspect at some point won’t be there again. 
 
The E stands for Energy, which is the quality of whatever you’re talking about. 
The quality could be things like large or small, fast or slow, happy or sad. 
There are qualities. There’s a kind of energy that describes things to us.  
 
Finally the M stands for Matter. How do we delineate that? What is this thing 
here? Does anyone know what this thing is? It’s a chair. Do we have a general 
consensus? It’s not a trick question. We would call this a chair. Would that be 
fair to say? 
 
How do you know this is a chair? It has to be because you’re distinguishing 
this from the floor and from me and from the walls. In nature there are no 
distinctions. There just is.  
 
In order for us to conceptualize and understand things, we have to break 
them up and decide that this is a chair and that this is the floor, and there’s 
only a floor for as long as it’s not a stage because when it’s a stage, it’s no 
longer a floor. It’s a stage now and that’s the floor. 
 
So, it can be a floor or a stage depending on what we need it to be. Do you 
see how many things can fall into different categories? It’s just our minds 
trying to slice up the pie of reality to be able to make sense of it.  
 
Let’s face it, when it comes to reality, there’s a lot of it, and there’s a lot more 
of it than you can handle at any level of your mind – consciously or 
unconsciously. Luckily, your five senses are incapable of perceiving most of 
reality.  
 
That makes life a little easier for you, but even those elements you can 
physically perceive with your senses are too much, so we’ve got to parcel 
them up into understandable things, and that’s when both great things and 
terrible things happen, and terrible things is what we’re trying to bypass with 
what we’re doing here. 
 
By the way, which one of those is who are you? What kind of question is that? 
We’re asking about their identity, right? How does it fit into those space, 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
44 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
time, energy and matter questions? Where would it fit in that? Matter, 
because who is just a socially acceptable way of asking what are you, isn’t it? 
 
Which individual of all of humanity – that’s the what – which one of those 
things we call a person are you? Really it’s just because people are so 
important to our lives that we actually create a whole question just for 
people, which is nice. 
 
Now we’re going to take this idea and see if we can just elaborate on it a little 
bit more. If we’re going to ask a question that encompasses everything – have 
you already noticed that the word ‘everything’ is interesting? What is 
everything in terms of the sySTEMs thinking? 
 
 
Space – Anywhere 
 
Time – Anytime 
 
Energy – Anyhow 
 
Matter – Anything  
 
I’m asking about matter, something physical. So, we have something like 
everything, which is about matter but we haven’t dealt with space. What’s 
the spatial equivalent of everything? Anywhere, right?  
 
It could be everywhere. I’m just going to go with anywhere for now, not 
because there’s any particular magic in that. Everywhere will work just as 
well. We’re just going to use a little stylized approach to make it easy for 
everyone. 
 
What about time? What’s the anywhere equivalent of time? There’s always 
but there’s anytime. I’m just going to stick to a linguistic similarity just 
because again it makes your life easier. Just realize that you can substitute 
any kind of phrases with that. I’m just making some inroads here. 
 
What’s the energy equivalent of this? Now this is going to get a little 
interesting because we’re not really used to consciously thinking about the 
energy of something. Anyhow, right? Because it gives you the quality of 
something, right? 
 
If we want to translate everything into something that fits the pattern we’ve 
set, what would it be? Anything. It’s not any better than everything. What’s 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
45 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
the difference between anything and everything? Anything is everything only 
it’s just one of those. Think about it. Isn’t that the case? 
 
It’s basically saying think of everything there is and choose one. That’s 
anything. Do you see how just a simple word has a lot of information built into 
it, but we toss them out like candy to kids and we don’t really realize what 
effect they’re having?  
 
One of the things you need to know, especially if you want to understand 
Mind Bending Language as a language, is that it’s not the language that 
matters. It’s the impact the language has on the brain, on the mind of the 
individual that matters. Do you see where I’m coming from? 
 
The language is only as good as the effect, and if you analyze the language 
you get a much better idea of predicting what the effects are going to be. If I 
asked you to think of anywhere but here, I know: 
 
1. It’s going to be a location. 
2. You have an infinity of space to think about, although most likely most 
of you will think about the world, which is just a very small element of 
space. 
 
3.  You’ll be thinking about a specific place.  
 
 
Compare that to if I said think of everywhere, which is different. I already 
know by choosing my words carefully what impact it will have on you. I want 
to encourage you to start thinking about the words you’re using and what 
those meanings that they carry can be because that’s going to color the way 
you influence people. 
 
 
So, we’ve got these ideas of anywhere, anytime, everywhere and so on. Let’s 
look at some other ways of looking at this. Anyway is one way of finding a 
spatial coordinate – anytime, anyhow and so on. 
 
 
If I say to you I am here, that’s locating a space again, isn’t it. There’s 
something different about me saying that I am here than if I say I am there. 
What’s the difference? It’s distance, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Could it also be associated and dissociated? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
46 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
That is a function of distance, isn’t it? We’ve just learned because of the 
physical mechanisms of our current universe that being physically 
disconnected from something can equal emotional disconnection from it too.  
 
 
Have you noticed that when people are emotionally disconnected – which is 
what dissociation can mean to a lot of people – how they use words that are 
spatially oriented? For example, you’re so far away from me? Why won’t you 
talk to me? Why are you so far? I can’t reach you. 
 
 
These are all spatial metaphors for actually a psychological or an emotional 
experience, aren’t they? So, here and there is a way of dissociating and 
associating but we don’t even have to get that complex. It’s just a way of 
having something close or distant, so we can move things around and there’s 
an impact – like dissociation and association – that it can have. 
 
 
What is a temporal equivalent – a time equivalent – that we can use for here 
and there?  
 
Student: Now and then. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Again, notice how now and then orient you to different positions 
in time. That’s an interesting word I’ve just used, isn’t it? Why am I talking 
about positions in time? It’s because you have no way of knowing that time is 
passing unless you have a physical mechanism, a spatial mechanism to judge 
it. 
 
 
You have the hands on a watch moving along. Do you know what the world’s 
first clock design was? It’s an ingenious piece. It was a water jar with a little 
hole in it so that the water would drip out and there was a physical 
mechanism to make sure that the water flowed out at a constant rate, so you 
knew that when the water jar was empty, a unit of time had passed. 
 
 
That’s pretty clever, isn’t it? But you’re still measuring movement. The water 
has to leave the jar for you to know time has passed, so time and space are 
inextricably linked.  
 
 
Some people – physicists in particular – will say that they’re the same thing 
but we don’t need to break our heads about that. We just need to understand 
that these things are embedded in our language and we don’t even realize it. 
We have to pay attention to it to realize it.

So, when is now? It’s now. When is then? Anytime but now, isn’t it? It could 
be in the past or it could be in the future. If you think about what you might 
be having for breakfast tomorrow, what’s going to happen then? That’s the 
future, isn’t it? 
 
 
If you think about what you had for breakfast this morning, what happened 
then? It’s the same word actually located in the future and the past. In a 
different language, we might have different words that locate us in the future, 
the present or the past.  
 
 
In English we do not, unless we use words like yesterday, tomorrow and so 
on, which will help orient us that way. Do you understand the idea of now and 
then? 
 
 
Let’s skip the idea of energy for the moment because that one’s a little 
trickier. Let’s just go to the idea of matter. How do we do the same thing with 
here and there and now and then with matter? This and that. 
 
 
Do you notice how this and that also have a spatial component? This and that. 
Think of it this way. This is the analogy we used in the DVD’s. Everyone just 
get a mental picture of this. When I say to you this is my car or if I say to you 
that is my car, what’s the difference? Do you get a different mental picture for 
each one?  
 
 
One of them is probably further away than the other. Is that correct? So, this 
and that is primarily about matter, but separating reality to space, time, 
matter and energy is an artificial construct. It’s just a way for us to make sense 
of all that there is – or not.  
 
 
So, it makes sense that a lot of these terms will also be somehow linked to 
each other as well because you only understand one thing in relation to 
another. At the heart of it all there’s a big nothing, which is a very strange and 
bizarre thought to think, but it isn’t. It’s just a whole bunch of assumptions. 
 
 
I’ll give you the energy equivalent. It’s not one that’s immediately obvious. 
We’re using the same words – this and that – but now we’re adding a 
qualifying – like this, like that – and already it changes things, doesn’t it? If I 
say to you this is my car, that’s one picture. If I say my car is like this, that’s a 
different picture, isn’t it? A different thought gets occurred.

Space – Anywhere – Here/There 
 
 
Time – Anytime – Now/Then 
 
 
Energy – Anyhow – Like This/Like That 
 
 
Matter – Anything – This/That 
 
 
Now we have some ways of basically asking the same things – where are you, 
when are you, how are you, what are you – but we can ask the same things in 
a way that fits a conversation more smoothly, can’t we? What’s anything 
you’ve been thinking about right now? Anything right now. Now I’m basically 
asking you what are you or what are you thinking? When are you or when are 
you thinking that? Do you see how that works? 
 
 
Don’t worry too much about the nuances of it. I just want you to get a general 
sense that you’re asking different questions about different portions of reality 
and you have choices within that range. Is that easy to do? 
 
 
There’s one last thing we did this morning that we haven’t accounted for here 
yet. We’ve accounted for the idea of the sySTEMs thinking – space, time, 
energy and matter. Is that correct? We have a simple vocabulary that allows 
us to navigate the same areas without necessarily asking the same questions 
– the interrogatives who, where, what and so on. 
 
 
There’s one thing we did this morning that we haven’t got on this list yet. 
What is that?  
 
Student: What. 
 
Igor: 
That’s close. What is a function of this and that and anything? It’s a question 
of matter, but what I’m thinking of sounds like what, only it’s not. It’s a 
negation, right? We used the word not earlier, so we want to use a different 
word for not now. Thank you. It’s but. 
 
 
What is the difference between the word but and the word and? The word 
and joins two ideas together. The word but negates whatever came before it. 
This gives you some room to play with.  
 
 
Now let’s see if we can put those essentially four systems together: 
 
1. We’ve got a questioning routine. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
49 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
2. We’ve got a negation, which you may or may not include. Don’t always 
include it by the way because otherwise you’ll get stuck in a different 
rut. 
 
3. We have the anything and the here and there. 
 
4. We have the word but. 
 
 
If you put them altogether, you come up with something that can be mildly 
disturbing in a hopefully fun way. If I ask you who you are, you give me your 
name. I’ll say no, you’re more than your name, aren’t you? So, who are you 
really that’s not this, anywhere but right now? What?  
 
 
Would that be a fair approximation of the thought going on inside your mind 
right now? But all I’ve done is I have combined just four simple things of 
which you’ve been doing half already into a fluid set of statements. 
 
 
To make matters easy, we’re going to temporarily put to one side the stuff 
we’ve been doing this morning. We’ll come back to that later. I’m only 
interested in this. I’d like you to spend five minutes talking to people about 
whatever – I don’t really care what it is – and I want you to just ask a simple 
question. 
 
 
You can either ask it in this form or you can just do a follow-up question – I 
don’t really care of it goes – which includes one item from each of those three 
lists.  
 
 
 
Who are you?        Anywhere         Here/There 
 
 
Where are you?     Anytime            Now/Then 
 
 
When are you?      Anyhow             Like This/Like That 
 
 
How are you?         Anything           This/That 
 
 
The Negation – But  
 
You can start with who are you anywhere but here? You could mix it up and 
say who are you anytime but like this? What? Think about this. What I’m 
really asking you at this point is I’m asking you to orient yourself into reality in 
a way that you’ve never conceived of before because you don’t normally think 
about your identity, your temporal existence and a quality that you exude at 
the same time, do you? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
50 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
So, when I ask you who you are anytime but now, or anytime but like this, I’m 
mixing sySTEMs that you have to carefully separate inside your mind and in 
doing so something else will emerge.  
 
At this level, it will most typically be a crazy spinning sensation inside your 
mind because you don’t yet know what to do with it, and that’s fine. That’s all 
we need. 
 
Does the core idea of this make sense to everyone? It’s just three simple 
things – anywhere but here, anywhere but now, anywhere but like this. You 
have lots of different choices and just mix them up. Just randomly choose one 
item from each of those three menus and you’re done. 
 
What I want you to pay attention to specifically if you’re delivering it is their 
reaction. Are you getting a glib response? Are you getting a denial response, 
which is it’s happening but I’m going to judge it and say it’s not good enough, 
so I’m going to try to answer it but I’ll dismiss it?  
 
Or are they genuinely engaging with your question, spinning out and having 
no real way of making a verbal response, because there’s no real verbal 
response you can come up with for this? You might get something but that 
will be a real lucky shot in the dark, unless you’ve been spending the last 10 
years in a Zen monastery, in which case this stuff makes total sense to you – 
and it will. This is part of where this came from. 
 
As the hypnotist, I want you to just observe. Can you observe and track those 
three things going on? Then as the person listening to this, I want you to just 
notice the same thing.  
 
Are you tempted to give a glib response, are you tempted to dismiss it, or are 
you okay with just sitting there and wrestling with this idea that you can’t 
quite grasp? And it’s okay not to. Do you understand what the exercise is? Is 
that easy to do?  
 
Student: My head is spinning right now. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. You’re already ahead of the game. So, ask a bunch of simple 
questions like this. The spinning sensation will get worse, I promise you that, 
but you’ll just get to enjoy it as well.

Then we’ll come back and we’ll start doing this in a semi-practical way. It 
won’t really be practical but it will be semi-practical. Easy stuff? All right, off 
you go. Find some people and change partners as often as you can.  
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Stand up if you want the mic.  
 
Student: Earlier on this morning when we were talking, as I came up to you and I was 
having this complete brain freeze. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, like what do I do with this? 
 
Student: Yes, what do I do with it? By the time we got here, I was a bit more 
comfortable with it and actually thinking it through. Sometimes I felt that I 
actually had an answer but I couldn’t verbalize it. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. That is exactly where I want you to be. Did anyone else notice 
that? What’s going on here? This is a very exciting place, by the way, because 
you know nothing’s changed in the nature of the questions. Is that right? 
Nothing has changed.  
 
 
What has changed is the nature of your mind’s willingness to engage with a 
question in a certain way, and that’s when the bizarre thing starts happening. 
You’re almost at the cusp of what’s called a breakthrough.  
 
 
You’re about to have an answer to something that should not be intelligible, 
and you know because you get that tip of the tongue phenomenon that says I 
know what this is, I just don’t know how I know it or what it is or how to 
verbalize it. 
 
 
It’s exactly the same thing as when someone asks you for the name of a 
movie star and you say I know who he is and I can even see his face, but I 
can’t quite say it, because language hasn’t caught up yet. Language tends – 
and I mean tends – to be more consciously controlled.  
 
 
A lot of other stuff is happening unconsciously, and what you’ve just 
experience is the charming effect of when you get unconscious insight, which 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
52 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
precedes conscious knowledge, which you can then start labeling and 
describing and so on. 
 
 
What you are experiencing right now – and this is why I’m so excited – is how 
real learning or what people would call accelerated learning or what I would 
call non-retarded learning works, which is that you have an unconscious 
insight first, an unconscious learning first. 
 
 
You kind of know it. You haven’t got a clue why you know it or what it is you 
even know, but then over time your consciousness catches up and that’s how 
you learn faster, better, have stronger ideas and more novel ideas. Some 
people call this the genius style of thinking, and that’s the kind of thinking that 
schools have destroyed in us.  
 
 
So, congratulate yourself because you really have made a huge step forward 
and it’s not necessarily easy because to get there. You still have to go through 
a little barrier. It’s like I’ll go with it a little bit and you’re like oh what’s this? I 
didn’t expect that to be there.  
 
 
That’s how the influence game works because they think they know what the 
answer should be, and if you’re going to influence them you’ve got to allow 
them to discover that there’s a better answer out there.  
 
 
The one that they had may well be a decent answer. There is nothing wrong 
with making sense of the way people talk to you in a logical, linear sort of 
sense and so on, and to know when people are on drugs and aren’t making 
sense on purpose. 
 
 
However, you have much more choice when you have the capacity to learn in 
a different way, to have a different range of experiences than the ones that 
are defined or predefined by what you already know.  
 
 
That’s kind of true and kind of not true because you actually know a lot more 
than you think you know, and it’s the stuff that you know but don’t let 
yourself know that’s really interesting, and that’s what you’re getting 
towards. 
 
 
You can already hear some mind bending stuff going on, can’t you? But that’s 
just because I need to use a clumsy vocabulary to describe something that we 
don’t normally allow ourselves to experiences.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
53 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
How often do you think about all those things you know but don’t know you 
know, who define you as a person a new experience, but actually if you had 
more access to that consciously would make a better you? That idea makes 
sense to everyone in this room. It would make less sense to people with Grant 
Thornton across the room right now. They’d say that doesn’t make any sense, 
but it does. That’s where she’s gotten herself to, so I would give her a round 
of applause because that was a big thing. 
 
 
That’s also what we need to start learning to recognize in other people when 
they’re getting to that place. What else have you noticed, experienced and so 
on? 
 
Student: When I was talking to a few people, they were either consciously or 
unconsciously timing their questions or pausing trying to come up with an 
answer or a word to say, and in doing so they gave me the time to reflect and 
just be there. 
 
Igor: 
So, when you were being asked the question, your questioner was slow in 
presenting all the elements of the question because they’re putting it 
together, and that gave you as the listener a richer experience because your 
mind went through different tunnels and had more time to think about those 
things. Is that what you’re suggesting? 
 
Student: And it made all the difference. 
 
Igor: 
Did anyone else notice that? Here’s a quick example of that in action. Think of 
something anytime but now only here. That’s one experience. Just think of 
something… anytime… but now… only right here. Which one gives your mind 
more spin? Which one sends your mind through a bigger loop – the first one 
or the second? It’s the second one. 
 
 
What do words do for us? They are hose pipes for thoughts. Hose pipes 
transmit water from one place to another. If you point the hose pipe this way, 
the water goes that way. That’s the nature of hose pipes.  
 
 
The nature of words is to point consciousness down one road or another. You 
understand every single word on this list. You understand more than these 
things. You understand all of these things and individually they make sense, 
and you expect a certain pattern.

You can predict that if I walk down this path here, it’s going to keep going all 
the way until I come to the end, which I already know about because you’ve 
already explored that in your personal history.  
 
 
If I ask you who you are, you know you’ll give me a name because you 
understand this is a path I’m walking on. I can give you my name and that’s 
what’s normally expected of me. 
 
 
Those of you who have dabbled in or have more experience in metaphysical 
concepts or have done more meditation type things, those of you who have 
been to more self-improvement things, especially those of you who have 
been to Esland – if you’re old enough to remember that; I’m not – will answer 
that question differently. 
 
 
If you say who are you, you’ll say oh I know this game. You have a separate 
path. You know the one that you tell people at work when they ask that, and 
you know the one you tell to people in seminars when they ask that because 
you’ve been there, so you have a different path.  
 
 
So, you’ll say who are you and they’ll say oh I’m a father, I’m the universe 
made manifest because that is what you’ve been educated or have learned as 
a viable answer to that question in a different context. Those of you who 
haven’t been in that context will say what do mean who am I? I’m just me. 
 
 
That’s because you haven’t got that path inside your mind. This is the essence 
of the agreement reversal. I’m going to break all your expectations but doing 
it only once you already started to expect because that’s the only way I can 
break it. If I say who are you anytime but now anywhere but here, you’ll say 
oh that’s just gobbledygook, that’s useless rubbish. Your mind switches off. 
It’s easy because you’ve got the whole piece.  
 
 
What I’ve got to do is wait until the point of no return, until thought has 
engaged expecting to come to its natural conclusion, but then interrupting it 
before it concludes. Hence, who are you anywhere but here, only now?  
 
 
Can you feel the shifting of the thought channels happening constantly, and 
that’s why you get led to something new. At this point, this is a mechanical 
process. The places you’re going to will expand your mind. There’s no doubt 
about it.

What practical applications that has, apart from just the usefulness of having 
an expanded mind, well that is questionable at this point but that’s the 
purpose here. It allows you to experience what it means to go through a 
process of expanding your consciousness, and in time once you learn to 
recognize that in yourself and in others, then we can start using it for a 
purpose because until you can do that what’s the point of getting subtle with 
stuff? 
 
 
Thank you. That was a very, very good observation. I’m really glad you stuck 
with it. Do you want to stand up and grab the mic? 
 
Student: I don’t know how relevant this is but I noticed the people that tried to answer 
me were trying to be really genuine instead of giving me an answer that 
maybe I would like to hear. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. That’s a wonderful thing. That’s partly because I’ve set the 
expectation upfront. We’ve spent at least two or three different segments 
where I reiterated the point on how to engage with these questions to make 
them of use to you. So, I’ve set the pre-frame for you already. 
 
It won’t necessarily be as easy as that in public, at least not with these 
questions because you have to set that same expectation. However, you will 
get the same response once you start doing it subtly, and that’s when we start 
looking for that genuine response with complete strangers when you can 
recognize those thoughts as they’re happening and know just where the 
sweet spot is at which you can derail that thought down a different line for 
the influence stuff to occur.  
 
 
At that point you will get just as genuine a response as that but they’ll be so 
caught up in their thought, in the pleasure of thinking a new thought that 
they’ve never had before, that they won’t realize it’s going on. That’s when 
you start getting real genuine unconscious material coming up, which is the 
stuff we need to work with. 
 
 
So, you are really ahead of the game by noticing that. I admit that I’ve created 
an artificial environment for you to get that here, and we will get to that point 
again with the advanced Mind Bending Language when we get onto that to 
make it useful, but right now it’s just great to be able to recognize it.

Thank you. Do you want to stand up and we’ll get a mic to you? 
 
Student: Thanks. Something just popped in my mind that I just noticed. We’re asking 
who, where, when, what and how. Does why fall in that category? 
 
Igor: 
Why is a wonderful question. Why is that? Every question has an impact. It 
has an implied suggestion. Actually every word has that. In our society the 
word why implies justification, rationale. You have to prove to me that you 
are rational. Why do you do that? Well, I just felt like it. Why are you such a 
pain in the backside? 
 
 
The problem with the strength and the weakness of the word why is that it 
makes things more real because you’re committing to a position. Why are you 
such a bad person?  
 
 
The only way you can answer that is to prove you’re a bad person, unless you 
break the frame and say I’m not a bad person, in which case it goes down a 
different track. 
 
 
So, if someone actually answers a why question, then make whatever you’ve 
asked about more real. That’s great when they’re in a useful place. For 
example, in therapy I will happily use the why question once they’ve finished.  
 
 
For example, how do you feel about what’s happening now? Oh, I feel great. 
Well, why is that? Well, I don’t know. Really? Think about it. Why are you 
feeling great? That’s weird, isn’t it? Do you normally feel like that? 
 
 
What I’m doing is I’m forcing them to justify that they’ve changed. I’m ready 
to leave now. Why? Well, I’m done. Why do you say that? Because I feel done, 
I’m just done. Really? Yes.  
 
 
Now I’m in the wonderful position where they’re trying to persuade me that 
they’ve finished the work rather than the opposite way around where I’m 
saying no you really have changed, really you have. 
 
 
Why makes things more real because it asks for justification. If you want 
something to be more real, ask them why because then they’ll justify it and 
they will socially commit to that position, and they will backwards rationalize 
that that is actually what they want. It cements it in.

If you don’t want it, then you need to ask a different question that has the 
same impact as the why you intended but doesn’t have the same outcome. A 
lot of times when people ask why, what they’re really asking is how come?  
 
 
They’re not asking for you to prove that they are correct. They’re just asking 
how did you get to that conclusion – in other words please explain your 
thinking to me. It’s no comment on whether or not that thinking is correct. Do 
you understand the subtlety of where we’re going with this? 
 
 
The why question is an important one. We will come onto that more when we 
come to the influencing side of things. However, it’s been specifically left out 
of this because we want to become less real. We want to go to areas they’re 
not as sure about. What I could do very easily – I’m sorry, what’s your name 
again?  
 
Student: Tayo. 
 
Igor: 
Actually, could we have a mic over here, so we can demonstrate what I mean 
by that question? Is it okay if we play a little bit? So, Tao you mentioned a 
moment ago that you had this little breakthrough where your mind is spinning 
but you had this sense that something’s happening in the background, so you 
can almost answer but not quite. Is that correct? 
 
Tayo: 
Yes.  
 
Igor: 
Tell me was that a comfortable realization to make? 
 
Tayo: 
It was. 
 
Igor: 
Why? Do you see her expression? The action is not in me. The action is what’s 
going on inside her mind. Are you feeling it happening again, by the way? 
 
Tayo: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
How do I know that? It’s because she has to recreate the conditions in order 
to have a thought about it that will justify her experience of it – in this case a 
pleasant one – to make more real, which means the chance of it happening 
again is that much greater now.

She hasn’t even answered the question. I didn’t even have a social 
commitment yet but even the attempt at answering the question will make it 
so. To be fair to you, I will ask for an answer just because it will actually help 
you even further in the seminar, so this is actually more for you than for me. 
 
Tayo: 
Okay, can you reframe? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. So, you had that spinning sensation in the back of your mind. You 
mentioned that you had this sense of almost knowing something that you 
weren’t quite sure of, and actually this time around it was a comfortable 
experience as opposed to before when it was less comfortable, right? 
 
Tayo: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Why was that comfortable? 
 
Tayo: 
Because I recognized that I had moved beyond that spinning place and I was 
in more territory where it was just a nicer feeling.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you. So, to the extent that you have nicer feelings throughout the other 
exercises, then you’ll know you’re doing it right. Is that correct? 
 
Tayo: 
Correct. 
 
Igor: 
So, the less you think about what the question should mean, the more 
opportunity you have to feel good like that. Is that kind of what you’re saying 
to me? 
 
Tayo: 
Pretty much. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. None of that was true yet but it is now. Do you see the power of 
the word why here? I hope you’re beginning to appreciate how wonderful 
language really is and how debilitating at times, but there is magic in words 
and there’s also no magic in words because it’s not the sound that you’re 
making.  
 
 
To someone who doesn’t speak the English language, I am talking a bunch of 
rubbish right now because it means nothing to them. What matters is how 
those sounds channel your thoughts to certain meanings, and that’s where 
the magic happens.

If your sounds aren’t doing that, they’re useless. If the sounds are, then they 
are great and they are powerful and they are transformative. So, they’re 
simultaneously useless and incredible powerful tools.  
 
 
I want you to have an appreciation of language for the power that it carries 
whilst dismissing it because you know the real action is in the brain and in the 
mind, not in the words – but then the words define that, so that’s the 
relationship. 
 
 
It’s the paradox that you’re going to get very comfortable with as we continue 
this training. I appreciate that. Thank you for that. 
 
Tayo: 
Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Give her a round of applause. Have you found this useful? Was this a useful 
little interlude here? Why? Just because, right? Are there any other 
comments or questions? 
 
Student: I noticed that in the first round when we were asking how are you, where are 
you, people were slightly embarrassed and they were trying to escape the 
question, and they gave kind of a simplistic answer and then asked some 
other questions – where are you, what are you doing? When we moved on 
this one, their degree of absurdity is much higher and for that it’s no pre-
baked answer and it was much easier to engage a second part in there. 
 
Igor: 
I totally agree with you. Did everyone else have that experience as well? It 
was strangely easier with the stranger questions than with the more normal 
questions. The reason for it is because with these questions – who are you, 
where are you, when are you and so on, except for possibly the idea of when 
are you – these questions are questions we ask every day. 
 
 
These questions are questions you think you already know the answer to, 
even though actually each one has multiple levels of answers. This goes back 
to what we talked about before.  
 
 
One of the biggest disservices that schools have done for you is to leave you 
with the false impression that every question has one answer. Who are you 
has many more answers than a name, but if you’re so obsessed with finding 
the right answer or trying to second-guess what the teacher wants you to say,

then you’re busy playing a very different game than actually running your own 
mind. 
 
 
You’re not learning how to think. You’re learning how to obey because you’re 
learning how to present the answer that you think they want from you. Do 
you understand the subtle distinction? What we’re interested in here are the 
fundamental mechanics of thinking.  
 
 
We’re actually a little bit ahead of what I was planning to do. This is more of 
what we’ll be thinking about tomorrow but you’re pretty much there, so we 
may as well run with it. We’re dealing with the fundamental mechanics of 
thinking because thinking leads to conclusions.  
 
 
Those conclusions become ideas, feelings and behaviors and when you can 
really help shape someone’s thinking, than you’ll shape everything about 
them. That makes you incredibly influential. Do you see how that works? 
 
 
Why it’s easier with words like anywhere but now and so on is because you 
don’t ask things like that on an everyday basis. They’re free from 
preconceived answers, so you have to work a little bit more to get the answer, 
and that’s why you get more of that spin and so on. Plus of course it’s 
becoming a little safer in here to do that. 
 
 
If you go outside and go next door to where Grant Thornton is having their 
conference and say hey what are you doing anytime but now everywhere but 
here, they’ll say what’s wrong with you, should we call the police, because 
once again you’ve broken that context again but that’s okay because these 
are training wheels.  
 
 
If they’re still here at the end of the week, I’ll show you how to make them 
drooling puddles of minds on the floor and thank you for it, but we’re not 
quite there yet. Is everyone enjoying this so far? 
 
 
Remember the reason this is awkward to answer is because you think you 
already have an answer to it. It’s very difficult when I ask you who are you to 
reverse your expectation and do that agreement reversal, to make you think 
I’m going to give my name and suddenly not, but what happens if we put the 
power of what you just experienced just now together with this?

If I ask you who are you anywhere but here, doesn’t that fundamentally 
change the nature of that question so that the glib response you would be 
normally tempted to give disappears as you’re about to give it, and that’s the 
key here.  
 
 
This is going to be your challenge for the next exercise.  
 
The Power Of Pacing 
 
Igor: 
You already have done all this. You know how to say who are you, who are 
you not? You know how to say anywhere but now, anywhere but like this, 
anytime, anyhow and all that sort of stuff. You know how to say that. It’s easy. 
It’s just randomly choosing something from the list. It’s not rocket science. 
 
 
So, what’s going to be the secret here is going to be the timing. It’s not what 
you say but when and how because the what I’ve taken care of for you. The 
what is important and we will look at the what in more detail as we go along, 
but right now I want to hold the what constant.  
 
 
I’m even going to hold the how constant in the sense of how you deliver it. 
Are you delivering it glibly like what are you, or are you delivering it with more 
meaningfulness? What are you? So, we’re holding the what constant and 
we’re holding the how constant. 
 
 
The thing I want you to experiment with now is the when. When do you move 
on from each concept because each one of these things is a concept? How are 
you… not… that’s happy… anyhow… but like this? 
 
 
Even though I did not time my pauses to you, did you notice how the pauses 
alone were enough to start a different train of thought at each step, and just 
when you thought you knew what I was asking, it changed? That’s where the 
power comes. 
 
 
There’s a wonderful movie called Memento. Has anyone seen it? It’s 
wonderful because it’s a story that’s told in reverse. You see the ending first 
and it means one thing to you. Then you backtrack to five minutes before that 
ending, and that ending means something different to you now. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
62 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Then you backtrack five minutes before that, and suddenly that means 
something different to you. By the time you’ve backtracked the morning of 
the event, the entire story looks totally different and it’s looked different at 
least a dozen different times with each back step in the story. It’s wonderful. 
 
 
 
We’re doing Memento here. They think they’re about to answer a question 
that’s as simple as what are you doing or what are you? Then if I add not they 
get derailed a bit. Then suddenly comes in this idea of anywhere and it’s like 
what? Huh? Where would I be?  
 
 
Then suddenly it’s like but – oh you mean not that? Right now – oh what’s 
going on right now? You’re constantly reorienting their minds to elements of 
their thinking process that they routinely do not engage in, and that’s where 
the spinning comes from.  
 
 
That’s where you get to that point where you almost have an answer, and 
that’s where you have powerful transformation, both therapeutic and also in 
terms of influence – sales and so on. 
 
 
I’ll just give you a quick pre-taste of that if I may. I’m not going to say that this 
language is appropriate for a sales meeting, for example, because it’s still 
clunky but the concept is what I want you to understand.  
 
 
Does anyone here do sales? If you own your own business you do sales, or if 
you’re a hypnotherapist for example. Has anyone here ever come across the 
idea oh that’s too expensive or oh that’s pretty expensive, I don’t know if I can 
afford that? That’s a pretty standard thing.  
 
 
What they’ve basically done is they’ve concluded ahead of time what it is they 
want to spend. They haven’t included in that calculation anything to do with 
realism usually.  
 
 
So, what you’re doing is you’re interrupting their thought processes before 
they can conclude inaccurately, because that conclusion was based on 
inaccurate information, long enough for you to introduce the information 
they need to be thinking about so that suddenly when they come to the 
conclusion, the price seems actually appropriate. 
 
 
How you do that is what the next four days are about. That’s not what today 
is about. Right now I just want you to appreciate that you are learning to 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
63 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
master the process of thinking in yourself to a certain degree, but also in 
other people.  
 
 
If you cannot observe those thoughts occurring, then it’s very difficult to 
influence them. It can still be done but then you’re doing the equivalent of 
writing a sales letter that has to try to preempt as many things as possible and 
then lead them down that path. That’s the tricky way of doing things. 
 
 
Do you all understand the concept of what we’ve been talking about so far? 
Now it’s time to do an exercise, and the exercise is really exactly what we just 
did. You’re going to start off with the anywhere but here, anyone like that and 
just have fun with it. 
 
 
Just start them off with those questions. Basically put everything you’ve done 
today into one thing. The only choice you have is whether or not you place 
that not in the suggestion in the beginning, in the middle or the end and 
whether or not you even use the not. Would you like to have a couple 
examples of what I mean? 
 
 
When you think about this, where are you… that’s anything… including 
happy… except like this? Do you feel it happening? Who wants another one? 
It’s like free drugs. 
 
 
How are you not… really learning this stuff… anyhow… but right here? Now I 
can sense a whew, as thoughts are going woo and you can feel that, can you 
not? So, that’s all we’re looking for. You have a lot of freedom in terms of how 
you construct and put these things together. 
 
 
Each individual item is simple to do – a question, the suggestion can fit in 
anywhere. You can put it in the beginning, the middle or at the end and you 
have a negation in there somewhere or maybe not.  
 
 
Then you just put this little thing here. These basically add more spin. These 
make it less likely that they’ll get stuck on what they think your question 
should be. 
 
 
The only thing I want you to pay attention to as the person asking the 
question is when do you choose to present the next part of your question? 
You won’t necessarily know why you’re doing it when you do it and that’s 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
64 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
what we’ll talk about when we come back from the exercise. Is everyone clear 
on that vagueness?  
 
 
Try to do it with at least two or three different partners, or maybe even five if 
you can get to it because different experiences will be useful. Off you go. 
 
 
I don’t mean to interrupt for very long. You’re going to carry on exactly the 
same exercise but there are a couple of things that I’ve seen as a pattern 
developing in the room that I want you to be able to contrast against. There’s 
nothing wrong with it. I just want you to understand what the different 
reactions you’ll get are when you do it one way and when you do it another. 
 
 
The thing I would like you to do is do this in two ways. You’re asking all the 
right questions. You’ve got all the right pauses – and we’ll talk about that in 
the actual group session when we come back – but the way I want you to ask 
it just to keep a contrast is: 
 
1. Ask it in a way that feels comfortable to you to ask it in the social 
context that you’re in. 
 
2. The other one is to temporarily ignore how you would feel comfortable 
asking the question and just ask these questions as though they’re the 
most interesting and natural things to ask someone, and if they don’t 
get it it’s because they’re being a little bit slow, but that’s okay. You’re 
patient. 
 
Do you understand what I mean? To put it another way, in one way some 
people are being more apologetic about it and trying to make it more socially 
responsive – like what are you maybe sort of like? The other way is like really 
tell me, what are you… that’s like this… only happier anytime but now? 
 
If you don’t get it, it’s because I just have to repeat myself to you because you 
didn’t quite get it the first time, and that’s okay because I’ll happily ask you 
who you are… that’s like this only happier… every time but now. 
 
The responsibility in that second version is on you to make sense of what I’m 
saying, not on me to allow you to, to implore you to accept my question. Do 
you understand the difference? Try it both ways to get a contrast, and we’ll 
have two things to talk about when we come back. Off you go. Carry on.

How was that? Was it fun? Was it interesting? Over to you guys. What kind of 
things did you notice, especially in that contrasting of frames that we just 
talked about? 
 
Student: Well, what I’m noticing a lot is the more that’s being added with the 
suggestions, as well as the pauses, the more my responses are becoming 
more and more unconscious, so at this point it’s gone way beyond the 
confusion level and towards the whole if I say what I’m really thinking, you’re 
going to be thinking I’m just some sort of tranced out person all the time. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, which is kind of what we wanted right in front of you anyways. The place 
that you’re getting towards now, which is excellent, is this boundary between 
social acceptability and actual reality. 
 
 
I don’t know if we’ve had this discussion before but you know when you look 
at what psychologists say is normal, what the heck is normal? In fact, I 
personally think that anyone who actually tests as normal on any 
standardized test is the most messed up person in the world. Seriously, 
they’re denying their own individuality in attempting to conform to whatever 
the median is whatever most people tend to agree with in the world. 
 
 
That is my definition of madness. We are ourselves crazy. We have crazy 
ideas. We have crazy thoughts, feelings and so on. It makes total sense to us 
but it’s crazy to the rest of the world, and they should be that way. 
 
 
Of course in the context of what we’re doing here, you may or may not 
choose to share them. It doesn’t really matter too much. We are specifically 
pushing the envelope out to see what’s possible, what’s out there, but this is 
not part of the influencing game. 
 
 
Unless you’re into metaphysics or unless you want to shave your hair and 
become a guru, or you’re into doing some hardcore therapy stuff, you don’t 
need to take people to that place at all, but how will you know people are 
getting close to that place or close enough to create some kind of influential 
change unless you see the bigger version and go oh that’s just like that only 
smaller? Thank you. That’s a great realization to make.  
 
Student: I’m not sure if it’s significant, but one thing I’ve noticed is as I’m being asked 
the question and then answer it, I’m getting way more confused than when 
I’m actually asking a confusing question.

Igor: 
So, when you’re asking a question and they answer you – because I’m getting 
there too, you got me on that one – and they answer you, you’re getting a 
more confused reaction from them or from yourself? 
 
Student: No, when they ask me a confusing question… 
 
Igor: 
Oh, so they ask you a mind bending question? 
 
Student: A mind bending question. 
 
Igor: 
And you’re trying to respond to it. 
 
Student: I respond as best as I can and at the end of my response, I’m like… 
 
Igor: 
They look at you like that? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, that’s called a mutual trance. Well done. Really what this comes down to 
is – this is something that you’ll hear me say if you listen to the Advanced 
Covert Hypnosis DVD’s that you’ve watched of course before coming here – 
and that is Mind Bending Language is not so much about speaking like you’re 
on drugs. It’s like thinking as though you’re on drug, and then the language 
comes out naturally. 
 
 
Think about it. How do we know what to say to people when we say it to 
them? It’s because our mind is in one place and we’re using the words that 
best describe that place to others, and if they recognize that place kind of, 
they know what you’re talking about.  
 
 
You have just entered a space or a place inside your mind that is so unusual 
that you don’t tend to visit it every day, unless you do in which case you 
actually have words for it, which is even better. 
 
 
If most people do not visit this place, then just the act of describing it will be 
mind bending. Consider this. If your state of consciousness alters so much 
that the experience you’re having is one that you, and what we’d call “normal 
society,” do not routinely engage in, it’s a very unusual and more out there

state of consciousness, the mere act of attempting to describe it will be mind 
bending to people listening to it.  
 
 
That is by the way one of the ways that you can tell a “genuine” guru or 
mystic from the fakes. The fakes use clever language but they never live it. 
When they’re talking about it, it’s like yeah that sounds great but they clearly 
haven’t been there. They’re just saying stuff that they get a good response to. 
 
 
The people who have lived it are desperately trying to get you to understand 
– no, this is what it’s really like. A friend of mine is into what I like to call 
hardcore Buddhism, which is an interesting thought.  
 
 
Of course I don’t mean the kind that get really upset and burn themselves 
instead of the world. I mean the kind who sit there and will meditate for 60 or 
90 days straight without talking to anyone, just intense concentration all the 
time.  
 
 
When people do that, the kinds of places their minds reach if you do it 
properly – we’re not talking about just quieting your mind a bit. We’re talking 
about something much, much far beyond that.  
 
 
The kind of descriptions they give of the places their mind goes are pretty 
much the same as the kind of description people give who are on hardcore 
psychedelic drugs, and of course in those countries where it’s legal to do so. I 
had to put that disclaimer in there of course. 
 
 
The point is they have such an altered reality experience that the mere act of 
trying to describe it to you will warp your own mind. It will warp your own 
thinking because you’re attempting to reconstruct the same experience in 
your mind and it’s like this doesn’t fit, this can’t fit. 
 
 
Incidentally, that is what also used to be called madness. Seriously. We now 
have “better labels” – oh no he’s not mad; he’s merely psychotic – which is 
not very useful either.  
 
 
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard someone present a psychotic rant. If you’re 
interested in knowing what it sounds like or what the language is like, go to 
Amsterdam Airport. They have a little bit of “art” there. They have one of 
those text display things that basically displays a slightly murderous psychotic 
rant. It’s horrible, but anyway you get to see what it’s like.

All the psychotic is doing is trying to describe to you his internal experience, 
but to you it just sounds bizarre and weird, and that’s because it is to you. You 
haven’t been there with it. 
 
 
 
Those people who have been through that come back out the other side and 
say oh yeah, I’ve been there. You say really? Yeah, mine was a little different. 
Mine was like this. The two can have a nice little conversation going and 
everyone else is looking at them saying these guys are both nuts. 
 
 
It’s not that they’re nuts. It’s that they share a different reality to you. What 
you just experienced there is exactly that. By the way, you haven’t really 
gotten anywhere near to where the edge is right now. You’ve only gotten to 
the edge of what is socially acceptable as an edge, and that’s actually 
pathetically small in terms of what you’re capable of. 
 
 
It’s only because you’ve been censoring that edge because you’re trying to be 
normal, so you haven’t had these mind blowing mystical experiences. By the 
way, I include myself in this as well.  
 
 
I’m just as limited in that capacity as anyone else is, but by at least going to 
that edge and by trying to describe what that is like, you already know what 
Mind Bending Language is like because it just comes out that way, and that’s 
what makes life easy to you.  
 
 
If you’re willing to navigate these highways inside your mind and willing to 
think along these ways, you’ll come up with things – and I guarantee you this 
and we’ll come into this more when we look at this specifically – that are both 
100% rational and logical and will sound like a crazy rant at first, but if 
someone can actually follow your train of thought properly, there is no flaw in 
your logic. 
 
 
When you can do that subtly in terms of a normal conversation, then you 
have the power to really influence because you’re letting them experience a 
reality they couldn’t conceive of before, and that really is what I think is the 
heart of influence. So, thank you. That was a rather nice thing to realize.  
 
Student: I’m just glad you aren’t calling me psychotic.

Igor: 
Yes, I’m not calling you psychotic in the least. I think it’s a very healthy thing 
to do. Exploring your own mind is a wonderful thing and there are safe ways 
to do it and there are unsafe ways of doing it. This is a very safe way of doing 
it but it goes back to what we talked about before with the lady right behind 
you. 
 
 
If you judge an experience you’ve never had too soon, typically because of our 
schoolings we’ll judge it negatively and so we’ll reject an experience that 
could be the most transformational experience you’ve ever had in your life. It 
could be the turning point that you’ll look back on and say I am so glad that 
happened. 
 
 
And you could be denying yourself that, just because you say oh I don’t know 
what this is or I better go back to here because I know the answer’s over here. 
I think it’s a wonderful place to be in, and you know the difference, by the 
way, by the facility you had in coming back.  
 
 
If you can switch back to normal “lucid” type or normal speaking, then you 
have control. Then you’ve navigated quite wisely. If on the other hand you 
find yourself on the outer fringes and no clue of how to get back, if you’re 
kind of literally lost in space, if you’re lost in inner space – well then you have 
more in common with a psychotic than with other people and it’s just a 
question of choice at that point. 
 
Student: If you can’t get back you might not care. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Anyway, those are very heavy thoughts for a relatively light program. 
I just wanted you to understand that there’s a lot more to you than you 
realize and when you embrace that, this becomes a lot easier than you 
realized because it’s more a question about allowing yourself to have 
experiences that you describe to others, and then actually take them along on 
a journey that they’ve never had before.  
 
 
That’s enough of me for a while. Thank you very much. What kinds of 
experiences or comments do you have? 
 
Student: In order to make this last session more conversational, I would give them a 
fairly standard question like who are you and they would give a glib or a 
standard answer.

Then I would add in and yet, and then I would give them a mind bending 
question to that. It seemed to really segue into a more comfortable place. It 
freed them up more. 
 
Igor: 
Of course it freed them up because you’ve trapped them at the point where 
their thinking has gone past the point of no return. You’ve caught them by 
surprise. Who here has ever done something they didn’t expect to do when 
they were caught by surprise? That’s what we’re doing here.  
 
 
We’re basically surprising them into a new thought, one that they may not 
otherwise have chosen because it’s not as well defined for them. That’s great. 
That’s what they’re here to do. They’re here to have those new thoughts in 
many ways. 
 
Unconscious Responses 
 
Igor: 
Who here could actually almost track people’s thinking patterns by how they 
were physically reacting when you asked the question? Put your hands up 
please.  
 
 
I’m curious to find out can you notice how thoughts kind of start off slow? 
They have kind a peak and then they crest away and then fall away again like 
they’ve put it away. It’s like that’s done and dusted, yeah my name’s Igor, 
done.  
 
 
Who are you? Oh, yes I’m Igor. Done. You can see the little spike in a wave 
almost. How do you recognize that? What kinds of things were you paying 
attention to?  
 
Student: It’s facial expression change and sometimes physical change. 
 
Igor: 
What kind of expression changes are you seeing? Can you demonstrate it? 
 
Student: Their eyes glazed over. 
 
Igor: 
So, you had eyes glazing, looking off into space, blinking changes. Maybe their 
focus internalizes. Did anyone notice people closing their eyes? Why do 
people do that, by the way? Because they’ve been taught once again in school

that if it doesn’t look like you’re making an effort, then you can’t be making 
an effort and you’ll be punished.  
 
 
What’s two plus two? Well, I don’t know. You haven’t even tried. Yes I have. 
No you haven’t. All right, what’s two plus two? I don’t know. Okay it doesn’t 
matter. I can show you the answer to that, which makes your life easier 
because you can see what people are thinking – thoughts. 
 
 
There’s actually a funny story about that. Does everyone here know who 
Wittgenstein was? He was a philosopher and he was renowned for having a 
certain expression when he thought. A friend of mine met Wittgenstein’s 
daughter. He didn’t know who it was.  
 
 
He just met this girl at the university and he said there’s the strangest thing. 
There’s this girl in my class and every time you ask her a question, she sits 
there and goes like this and she comes up with a great answer, but she would 
literally physically do this and then ask you a question, and another guy goes 
oh, did you know she’s related to Wittgenstein – because that’s exactly how 
he thought. He would sit there and go like this, and he’d come up with these 
deep philosophical ideas. 
 
 
It was a habit in their family. That’s how thinking is expressed physically. It’s 
very tiring but I guess you can call them mental athletes at that point. Whilst 
people may not necessarily do this all the time, you do see a variation of that, 
and that’s one of the clues that thinking is going on. 
 
 
You also know just before they have a conclusion, and that’s the point where 
you drop the next little thing in because just before their answer gets 
resolved, you have all the raw material there and you now shove that down 
the next path and now there’s more thought coming along. 
 
 
But these are all unconscious thoughts because they can’t even track them 
yet. They don’t quite know what’s going on yet. Do you understand what I’m 
talking about here?  
 
 
These are strange ideas to talk about purely and simply because I’m asking 
you to use your minds in a way that you don’t usually do that, and these 
questions are designed to help people access that as an experience.

That’s really what we’re getting used to right now, and then we’ll look at how 
to do this functionally and how to use this as something useful to us. Do you 
want to stand up with the mic? Then we’ll come over here. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I’m finding that with just one question, my mind just goes off into space, so 
I’m finding a massive overload with like the whole entire anywhere but here. I 
can’t track it.  
 
Igor: 
Right. So, you’re saying when someone’s asking the question, you find that 
just asking who are you it’s like yep I’m off. Wow.  
 
Student: Yes, I get lost there. Then I’m gone and I can’t listen. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. I understand that. That’s just a question of pacing. May I demonstrate 
what I mean? 
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
So, who are you? No, who are you really… that’s anywhere… that’s anywhere 
but here… only now… just over there… what’s that? 
 
Student: I don’t know. It’s something big. 
 
Igor: 
It is big, isn’t it? Can you see his train of thought written all over his face? Did 
you have any problem following that thought? 
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
So, the difference was pacing. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
If I rush you – which we’ll do now and I’ll apologize for this right now. I’m 
going to put my Russian/rushin’ hat on. When I say who are you anywhere but 
here only right now, do you I’ve lost him? He’s still stuck in who are you? Can 
you see that?  
 
 
I have mis-communicated because I’m going way too fast. I learned this from 
hypnosis but I used to be a lawyer a long time ago in a different life –

flashback – and one of the things we trained in was in advocacy, to stand up 
in front of a court to deliver a statement. 
 
 
I wasn’t particularly good as a public speaker. In fact, I was quite terrible. 
That’s another story for another time, but the one thing I did learn – and this 
is from the little hypnotic training I had – is about pacing.  
 
 
The only thing I had was when I was doing my presentations in a moot court – 
which is a pretend court with a pretend judge – I would sit there and I’d 
present little facts like Your Honor I’m so and so and this is my client, and he’d 
sit there and start scribbling and that was my cue. I’d just shut up. 
 
 
He scribbled and scribbled and at some point he stopped scribbling. Then he’d 
look up and say and the case is about so and so. He’d scribble, scribble, 
scribble and I’d shut up.  
 
 
Eventually the scribbling would slow down and he’d look up and say and so 
we have this. It was literally little pint-sized pieces and it was really easy to tell 
when to shut up because he was writing.  
 
 
Not everyone is that easy to read of course, but you were charmingly easy to 
read on that level. But what do you think would happen if I just gave you the 
information as facts – this is so easy, it’s about this, this and this, it’s so easy, 
do you get it? No. Oh come on, don’t be slow. It’s this, this and this. 
 
 
What you’ve done is you’ve rushed ahead. Once again, to get My Little Pony a 
lot of teachers do this, don’t they? We do this ourselves by the way. We do it 
to other people because it’s easy for us; therefore, it must be easy for them. 
 
 
A classic example is giving directions. Oh you go down this road and there’s 
this building here, it’s green, remember that it’s green, then you turn to the 
left, you walk about five yards and there will be a cigarette building, oh forget 
the cigarette building, but next there will be this thing and then you’ll turn 
left, and then there’s that road called Havenard Avenue.  
 
 
Remember that Havenard Avenue. It’s really easy because it sounds like 
cavern and it has an ard at the end of it, right? So, Havenard you go down 
there and you turn around, you walk around this roundabout – and by this 
point you’re totally lost. It’s like what the heck? You say just give that to me 
again. All right, you down over here, you got the green building, green, get it?

They start talking to you like you’re an idiot. It’s not that you’re an idiot. It’s 
that they’re incapable of giving you proper directions because they’re 
dumping information on you in too large of chunk size because every element 
of that information is familiar to them, so it’s easy.  
 
 
To you, you’ve never heard of these things put together before, so actually 
those are mind bending directions. The only problem is if they expect a result, 
it can be very frustrating. So, it’s just a question of pacing, which is really what 
this whole exercise was about in many ways.  
 
Student: When I tried to practice these questions at home, after about 10 or 15 
minutes I had this urge to smash them. It is psychotic? 
 
Igor: 
Who knows? Here’s what’s going on. Basically it’s the flipside of frustration. 
When you get frustrated for too long, you get angry. It’s kind of the 
experience that you almost had at the start of the whole session, which is 
you’re trying to make sense of something in a way that you can’t make sense 
of that particular kind of information, and so there’s a little bit of frustration 
but you go with it. You say this is okay, I’ll go with it.  
 
 
You’re trying to make sense of it in the same way some more and some more 
and some more and each time that frustration builds. So, it’s only really a 
question of how you engage with the questions and how long.  
 
 
There comes a point by the way where it’s very useful to take a break. You 
just say okay that’s enough. I’ve expanded my mind enough. It’s kind of like 
the mental equivalent of going to the gym and lifting that one last pound. If 
you try one more, you’ll be frustrated too. It’s like no, I can’t do it.  
 
 
You’ve exhausted the energy supplies. In one case it’s the physical muscle and 
in the other one it’s the glucose that runs your brain. You can exhaust your 
mental muscles just as easily.  
 
 
So, it may just be that you’ve been exhausting it in the wrong direction, or 
you’re expecting a result other than what you’re getting, so you’re just 
increasing frustration by increasing that dissonance between what you think 
you should be getting and what you’re actually experiencing. It’s one of those 
two things probably.

Student: I’m getting more and more confused as the time goes by. These questions like 
who are you that is very, very happy, not here, not now, but anywhere 
anytime – you have taken the space out and you have taken the time out, so 
how can you construct a thought outside of space and time? 
 
Igor: 
You’ll never construct anything outside of space, time or energy and matter 
for that matter.  
 
Student: So, there is no answer to any of these questions, is there? 
 
Igor: 
Oh, that’s not quite right. It’s just that there’s no answer in reference to how 
you know to answer questions like that, but in time you will have an answer 
to it. For example how Amir just turned around and said I don’t know what it 
is yet but it’s big. Have you ever had an insight? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And before you had that insight, did you not have a sense of pressure inside 
your mind like you were close but you can’t quite work out what it is? 
 
Student: No, I think it’s kind of sudden. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, it just came in suddenly? So, you never had the version where you’re 
really thinking about it and thinking about it, and you know you’re close, 
you’ve almost worked it out and you get it and you say oh I get it now? Do 
you get that too? In the English language we have the phrase the penny 
dropped. That’s really what you’re doing here. 
 
 
I wouldn’t concern yourself about what the philosophical idea is. Are we 
thinking beyond space and time? Are we thinking outside of matter and 
energy? That is of no relevance here.  
 
 
The only thing of importance in terms of what we’re doing right here is to 
understand that by asking certain types of questions – and what they may be 
we haven’t fully defined yet; we just have one example of them – you can 
make people have mental work.  
 
 
There’s work going on inside their mind and it’s impossible to find that work 
in accordance to how they normally think. In other words, they’re thinking 
differently but they don’t know how they’re thinking differently. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
76 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: The immediate impact of all these questions is to stop you thinking. 
 
Igor: 
Do you stop to think where you normally think. There is still thinking going on. 
If I took a snapshot of your brain with an FMRI or something like that, there 
would be probably a wide spread neurologic activation.  
 
 
I haven’t done this, so I can’t give you an exact picture of it, but there will be a 
lot of stuff going on inside your brain, and the way it feels to you is like 
something spinning around inside your mind and you can’t quite grasp 
anything.  
 
Student: So, how do you express that nonverbal talk? 
 
Igor: 
That’s right. Now that’s the big question and we’re not there yet. We’re not 
here about answers. Remember let’s go back to where we started off today. I 
do not care about the answer. I do not care about getting a specific result yet. 
 
 
Right now you’re learning several things, one of which is just that language 
can have a significant effect on the mind when that language is presented in a 
certain way, and you can think in a way that you’re not normally accustomed 
to. 
 
 
All this will make more sense over the next four days when we start using this 
effect in a practical sense. Right now let’s go back to what we talked about 
today. Nothing of what you’re doing here will have any practical application 
yet. 
 
 
These are just interesting experiences for you to note and this will allow me to 
later on refer back to them so that you can recognize them as parts of the 
influence process, but right now you’re in exactly the right place. You’re 
having thoughts without knowing what those thoughts are.  
 
 
Let’s put it this way. There is stuff happening inside your mind. You can feel it 
happening but you can’t define it, describe it, label it or come to a satisfactory 
conclusion with it yet. In other words, it’s still open-ended. Would that be fair 
to say? 
 
 
So, you basically have the first half of the influencing process there. We don’t 
have the second half yet, so how can you possibly make sense of it? What I 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
77 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
will say to you is if I asked you those questions over and over again, if you 
start habituating those questions, you will start coming up with answers to 
them which are conscious, logical, describable and make sense to you. 
 
 
We’ve only been doing this for five or 10 minutes at a time, so your mind 
doesn’t know what to do with it yet. We’re just opening processes. We 
haven’t closed down on them yet. Does that help? 
 
Student: I don’t know what significance this has but it’s sort of an epiphany for me. I’m 
understanding the questions that I want to ask. Before, it was mechanics. 
Now I’m understanding it almost to the point – if they don’t understand the 
question I’m asking, not because they’re puzzled because I’ve messed up – I 
found I can change that and go somewhere, which was kind of cool. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. You are well ahead of the game. Now just to give you a contrast – and 
this is important to everyone – have you come across Mind Bending Language 
before? 
 
Student: Just a little bit on the tapes on the airplane coming down. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, that’s fine. So, you have some familiarity and now that’s starting to 
make more sense, right? Can I ask the gentleman behind you quickly, have 
you done anything with Mind Bending Language before today? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The same sort of thing – watching some things beforehand? 
 
Student: I’ve gone through all the DVD’s. 
 
Igor: 
You’ve gone through all the DVD’s? Okay. So, what I suspect is going on right 
now is the experiences you’re having here are starting coagulate for you right 
now. In other words, you’re starting to get reference experience for it. For 
you, you’re still in the process of acquiring them, and what he’s just described 
will happen to you either later today or probably tomorrow at some point.  
 
 
It’s just a different place at which your mind catches up. Sometimes we have 
really big thoughts like Amir and it takes longer for us to catch up to that 
really big realization.

Sometimes we can do it in increments and have a small win, a small 
realization, and so we still have that process. It’s just done in smaller steps. It 
doesn’t matter which way your mind works as long as it does.  
 
 
Are we good to go? All right folks let’s take an hour and a quarter for lunch. 
There are lots of restaurants literally right outside, so hopefully you won’t be 
too long. Off you go.

DVD 3 – How Memory Works & Using The MBL 
sySTEM To Open Up Closed Minds 
 
 
 
Igor: 
This morning before the lunch break, we played around with some hypnotic 
language or some specific kinds of language – the Mind Bending Language. 
You all are hopefully experiencing what some people call brain’s melting, 
brain’s spinning around, grasping for an idea without quite knowing where it 
is.  
 
 
Things are clearly happening inside. It’s just that you don’t have any idea what 
that is or how that works. Would that be fair to say? Now believe it or not, we 
don’t need to do anything with that yet. That’s actually what the influence 
segment is going to be all about tomorrow and so on. 
 
 
Today is all about just getting to this point. For now let it just be enough for us 
to assume that because you can feel your minds working in this way that 
whatever practical elements of a trance we need to have happen are 
happening. They’re just not necessarily happening in a way that you can 
relate to them yet, in a way that you can use purposefully, and that purpose 
will come. 
 
 
What I want to do for the rest of today are two things: 
 
1. Just put a little bit of purpose into this just to see if the nature of that 
melting feeling, that spinning feeling, that sense of having thoughts 
without knowing what you’re thinking, if they can be influenced just 
gently in one direction or another. 
 
 
In other words, can you have a mildly happier way of having that spin? Can 
you be mildly more curious? Can you be mildly more intrigued? Can you have 
a sense of something important in patterning without realizing it? 
 
 
In other words, can you relate differently to your vast experience of 
knowledge that you already have, because that’s the way that you create new 
knowledge? It’s basically by relating back to old knowledge in a new way, and 
that’s what makes room for new stuff. That’s what I want to play with today a 
little bit.

2. Then finally towards the end of the session today, we will go into how 
to do this in a more freestyle sort of way, which will really set a nice 
foundation for using this stuff in a practical way. 
 
Overcoming A Closed Mind 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s begin by observing what happens when our minds are closed. They 
can be closed in many different ways. Our mind can be closed because we’re 
stuck in an idea – no this is too expensive, no I don’t want that, no it can’t 
work this way, no I’ve tried that already but it’s not a good solution for me. 
 
 
You can be stuck in other ways. You can have a closed mind in the sense of 
whenever someone shouts at me, I feel bad. I try not to feel bad but I can’t 
help myself. 
 
 
That’s just another example of a closed mind, isn’t it? So, whether you have 
something that looks overtly therapeutic or something that looks more 
common and every day, the mechanics are really similar if not identical.  
 
 
That’s something that I’d like you to explore a little because you’re developing 
a sense of how to judge and observe what’s going on inside someone else’s 
mind.  
 
 
You can tell for example when someone has given no thought whatsoever to 
your communication and gives you a glib response, and it’s just trivial. Would 
that be fair to say? 
 
 
You can also tell when someone briefly tries to engage in the thoughts or 
ideas that you’re presenting to them but rejects them for whatever reason. In 
this case it was artificially created that the rejection would be pretty 
predictably along the lines of this doesn’t make sense; therefore, I’m not 
going to think any further on it.  
 
 
You can all pretty much spot the symptoms of someone’s thinking going down 
that path. Would that be fair to say? You can also tell that there’s a range but 
within that range people clearly are considering those ideas.

They clearly are following your trains of thoughts. Whether or not they can 
verbalize what’s going on or even have the conscious insight to it is irrelevant. 
In other words, stuff is happening inside the mind that doesn’t normally 
happen unless you’re there to ask these particular kinds of questions, which 
means that you’re causing it to occur. Actually, they’re causing it but they’re 
allowing it to occur in response to your question, right?  
 
 
So, you have a pretty good way of telling what’s going on inside someone’s 
mind but you can never turn this into something functional until you can also 
see when is their mind beginning to shut down? That’s partly already 
happening when people give you a glib answer or when they choose to 
dismiss your question, or when they judge the ideas you’re presenting to 
them so that they’re clearly evaluating it in a negative way inside their minds, 
so they’re not really engaging with the material properly. 
 
 
So, you can tell at that level already but what about ideas that are already 
there? What about conflicts that already exist? What about problems that 
keep their minds closed or stuck? Wouldn’t that be something that would be 
of great value to us to be able to spot as they occur in a conversation so that 
we can do something about that? Wouldn’t that be fair to say? 
 
 
So, here’s what I’d like you to do right now. I’d like for you all to think of a 
minor problem in your life. I mean something minor that if you never fix it, it 
doesn’t matter. I’ll give you an example of the kinds of things I mean. 
 
 
The kinds of things I mean are you were stuck in traffic this morning and the 
person behind you annoyed you, or you kind of hate it when in a restaurant 
they put the napkins on the left hand of the plate instead of the right hand of 
the plate, the kind of stuff that won’t kill you and won’t really significantly 
affect your life whatsoever if it continues on for the rest of your life.  
 
 
It’s just that there’s enough juice in there for you to realize that you’re kind of 
hung up on something. Do you know what I mean by that?  
 
 
Here’s what I don’t mean: 
 
 Anything that if it never changed would mortify you or would upset 
you. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
82 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 Anything that has a bigger history – I wasn’t loved as a child, my father 
used to beat me with a fish. 
 
 Anything that is more significant to you. 
 
 
What we’re not looking to do here is change it. First of all, it’s for the 
questioner to notice what it looks like when someone falls into how they 
change and to notice what happens when that opens up, if it does at all. 
 
 
It just allows them to be able to see these things, and you on the other side of 
the coin being the questionee will get an experience of what it’s like to have 
an opened mind and a closed mind. 
 
 
A closed mind is about being stuck, fixated, obsessed or without choice. An 
open mind has choice, is curious, is willing to experience and willing to try 
things out and so on.  
 
 
I don’t want to say too much about that because I’d rather you experience it 
than me describe it. Do you understand the nature of the states of mind that 
we’re investigating? To do it is going to be very straightforward. You’ll get 
together with a partner and you’ll just have a little chat like hey how’s it 
going? Who are you again? Gotcha.  
 
 
Very early on this is just enough to create a social interaction. You want to see 
what they look like when they normally talk because if you don’t have your 
reference point, how do you know they’ve changed? If their normal way of 
talking is like this and if they do this, how will you know they’re talking 
normally or having a problem? You won’t, so you need to have a sense of 
what they’re like when they talk normally. 
 
 
Then you can ask them can you tell me a little bit about whatever the problem 
is you were thinking about when Igor sat up there and reminded you of a 
problem to think about? Can you all think about a problem, a small minor 
inconsequential thing? Put your hands up if you can. Put your hands up if you 
cannot. I am the Buddha. I have no problems. My life is perfect. I’m teasing. 
 
 
In your cases I would encourage you to be the questioners first because when 
they start talking about their problems, you can say oh yeah I’ve got one of 
those. It’s a very common thing.

Remember, make it something that is so minor that it matters not whether it 
ever changes and you don’t actually mind sharing it with other people. This is 
not about therapy. This is just about observing how you can see shifts in the 
mind by expressions in the body. 
 
 
Then just ask them about that and say can you tell me a little bit about that? 
They’ll say oh yeah this morning in traffic this guy just came out of nowhere, 
Toronto drivers, what can I say? You’ll see it and then when they’re there, at 
any point you wish, once you know you’ve seen it, you can ask them a little bit 
more about it if you want and at any point without giving any warning, do this 
and see what happens.  
 
 
I don’t want you to evaluate it. You don’t have to make anything of it. All I 
want you to notice is did something occur and, if so, what was it? So, you’re 
really sorting for three different states of consciousness: 
 
1. Normal social. 
2. A little bit upset or stuck on something. 
3. With a bent mind. 
 
 
Just see if you can track those states in the conversation and notice what 
comes out of it as a result. Do those steps make sense to everyone? Are we 
clear on those steps?  
 
 
You will notice I have given you no instructions as to what specifically to do, 
how to have that conversation or what part of these things to use because 
frankly I don’t care. It does not matter. This is where you get to use a little bit 
of creativity. 
 
 
All I want you to do is sort for those three state changes in consciousness and 
at the end of it if you wish to have a little debrief discussion about how they 
experienced that, that could be of value too, and then we’ll come back. Easy? 
Let’s take five minutes, about two minutes apiece.  
 
 
These are not long conversations. Mind Bending Language works quickly, so 
you should be able to work it quickly. So, literally just two or three minutes 
apiece, switch roles and then we’ll come back and we’ll have a discussion on 
that and see how we can use that more functionally. Off you go.

Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
How did that go? Can we have the mics please? Just give me sort of synopsis 
of that went.  
 
Student: One of the things that I’ve experienced is that it brought back a memory, but I 
found that one of the lessons that we’ve been learning today is to put a pause 
in, talk slower, and we don’t. We start running. We start running, running, 
running and then I said to myself if you think you’re talking slowly, slow down. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. 
 
Student: That’s basically what I’ve gotten out of that. 
 
Igor: 
So, that was your internal experience whilst talking about the problem? 
Excellent. How would you contrast the switch, if anything, from talking about 
the problem and maybe even slowing down and them asking you some kind 
of a mind bending question, and what happened to your mind then? How 
would you contrast those mental states? 
 
Student: When I was asked the question, I actually put in a pause myself by laughing.  
 
Igor: 
Good.  
 
Student: And then came back with the answer. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: But the person that was asking the questions was doing that very well. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent, very good. What other things did you notice? 
 
Student: When I was talking about my problem and Paul started talking in a mind 
bending way, it felt like I was being physically moved in a landscape away 
from my issue. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And then I couldn’t quite get back there.

Igor: 
It’s kind of like you got lost inside you. It’s like this is so cool, but where was 
that monument again; you know the one I didn’t like? Where is it again? 
Right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Wouldn’t it be great if you could just kind of forget about our problems like 
that? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Stick close and we’ll address some of that stuff as we go on. There’s another 
question up front and then we’ll move our way forward.  
 
Student: What I thought was a really interesting technique is I was describing my 
problem and he said okay go through it again. So, I stated my problem and he 
interrupted me right then and went straight into a mind bending statement. 
At first I was like oh man I’m annoyed, you interrupted me. Then I went into 
oh this is new, and then it was like what was my problem again?  
 
Igor: 
Perfect. We’ll address that point in a minute as well. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I was working with I’m sure not an unfamiliar issue – impatience – and I was 
explaining to my partner how I was in Cuba and in line for ice cream and the 
guy was serving his ice cream. I think he was actually going other with me and 
kind of getting a little freaked out too. 
 
 
And the difference between the Mind Bending Language is it was basically 
over in 30 seconds. He brought me straight to a resource place where I had 
understanding, whereas when I was trying to work with myself in the line 
saying okay this is the culture of the islands, it’s slow, he’s not inconsiderate… 
 
Igor: 
In other words, you can’t logic your way out of it but something about that 
just broke right through. 
 
Student: It was just alright, period. 
 
Igor: 
Did anyone else notice this happening? Hands up. For those of you who 
haven’t had that experience, would you like to figure out a very simple way of 
getting more of that happening more consistently, not because we’re 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

necessarily doing therapy here but one of the limitations about having an 
influence seminar is you all want to influence people differently in different 
situations, and we can’t do it live here because the context isn’t here, right? 
 
 
For example, are there any parents in the room with teenage children? I know 
of course you have no desire to influence your teenage children whatsoever 
because they’re so malleable and so easy to understand and talk to, right? 
 
Tracking States Of Mind 
 
Igor: 
We can’t necessarily start bringing a teenager up and say okay let me show 
you how to do it, because the context would be skewed. So, a that we can 
actually really investigate what happens when minds get closed and stuck and 
so on is minor problems like this, and whilst it may look therapeutic, really 
what you’re doing is you’re tracking states of mind and that’s really what 
we’re interested in.  
 
 
As hypnotists, let me ask it this way. Did you notice the differences in their 
states of mind as they went to them? Could you clearly tell they’re just being 
socially chatty right now? Now they’re being a problem, Larry, and now 
they’re like I have no idea what just hit me but do it again, right? 
 
 
Can you all notice those shifts going through? What are you paying attention 
to that lets you know a shift like that is occurring as a hypnotist when you’re 
talking to the person and just watching the roller coaster of emotions and 
mental states emerging? Someone said their hesitation. Do you want to say a 
little bit more about that? 
 
Student: I was talking with Ticki and he said about the annoying problem about the 
traffic and things like that, and I used anyhow, anywhere kind of thing and he 
just went into a sort of… 
 
Igor: 
If I can pause you there. Words are less important to me right now. Did you all 
see him answer the question whilst trying to answer the question? Did you 
know what you did to answer the question? 
 
Student: Yes.

Igor: 
Exactly. There is it again, and that’s what I’m looking for because that’s 
basically telling me that your unconscious knows. Even if you’re struggling for 
the words, I don’t care. There will not be a test on this. You’ll not be graded 
by how eloquently you can describe physiological changes in people. 
 
 
What I care about is do you recognize it? Now I want to do another quick 
exercise based on the same idea, but what if you put that whole conversation 
together into one?  
 
 
Wouldn’t that be interesting, and see if we can actually do something 
practical with it because some of you felt the shift happen. Would that be fair 
to say? Some of you felt that you shifted but not necessarily in relation to the 
problem. It’s just you got distracted to something else. Would that also be fair 
to say?  
 
 
 
How do you do those things together so the changes aren’t random and the 
changes actually in relation to where the mind is stuck? Isn’t that an 
interesting thing to think about? Isn’t that really the heart of any influence 
process because if you can’t make your influence stick to the actual problem 
you’re trying to resolve, well then you’re not being very influential, are you? 
 
 
Here’s what I want to do. We’re going to do exactly the same thing again in 
many ways. Find a different partner. If you problem no longer has an 
emotional charge, please change ideas and come up with a different problem 
because that one is going to be less easy for them to track now. 
 
 
So, come up with a different problem if you need to or the same one. Just 
check with yourself and think about the situation. If you still feel it, then it’s 
still useful. If you’re not sure, then don’t use that one. Choose something else.  
 
 
There are plenty of minor annoyances in life that you can get on with, and if 
you don’t have one, please come up to me and I’ll give you one. Find a 
partner. Just say how’s it going? I hear you’ve got a problem. What is it? Just 
go right into it so that you can let them talk about it a little bit. 
 
 
All you’re going to do now, once they’ve talked about it a little bit, is to 
summarize their problem. You can say let me see if I understood you, except 
in the middle of your summary go into this.

If you want to have a little formula for it in terms of language, I’ll give you a 
formula but it’s only so you can understand the nature of what we’re talking 
about. It’s not really relevant if you memorize this. If you do want to 
memorize it, it’s on the ACH DVD’s and you can follow that formula there.  
 
 
Right now I’m more interested in the experience than the actual content. If 
you want a simple formula, it would be something along the lines of okay so 
let me see if I understood you correctly. You have a problem with X – ice 
cream or traffic. So, I’m curious, as you think about that traffic situation, 
where on Earth are you… that’s not this… anywhere but here? I mean feeling 
good, that is.  
 
 
Notice if you can pace it so that they follow every element of the experience, 
just like we did with Ahmet earlier on. So, you’re not rushing them through it. 
It’s not about saying the whole thing. It’s about pacing it so they say yeah oh, 
yeah, oh.  
 
 
So, they’re constantly catching up to your thoughts. Do you understand what I 
mean by this now? You’ve seen their thoughts already in action as separate 
entities.  
 
 
All you’re going to do now is chain them together, so as soon as one thought 
starts arising, then you add the next element of the mind bending question 
and then the next one and the next one. 
 
 
It doesn’t have to be one big thing. It’s just you’re surfing on the crest of those 
thoughts, and each mind bending mini phrase that you throw in there will 
create another little crest of an idea or of a thought and allow that to arise. 
Before it falls away, you throw the other one in and the other one. 
 
 
You can call it mental surfing, if you like. Do you all understand the nature of 
the exercise? Problem, summarize the problem and then clarify the summary. 
You can say as you are thinking about the traffic, as you’re scooping the ice 
cream or as you’re being slapped in the face with a wet fish by dad, I’m 
curious. 
 
 
The beauty about these questions here is they already fit any context. So, 
what are you… not doing… that’s happy… anywhere but there… only now? Oh 
yeah, you know what, that makes a strange kind of sense now. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

And it will make a kind of sense. I’ll let you get on with it in a second, but it 
will make a kind of sense because now you have something to relate it to. 
That’s all I’ll say on the matter for now.  
 
 
Are there any questions on that before we do the exercise? Excellent. Find a 
partner. No more than five minutes in total, so about three minutes apiece. It 
really is just one longer question that you’re asking. Off you go. 
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Judging by the difficulty I’m having getting you guys back, that may have gone 
rather well. Would that be fair to say? Let’s have some feedback. What is it 
that happened there?  
 
 
How was that different from the previous exercise, even though essentially 
you’re using the same mechanical pieces? What was your experience as the 
hypnotist or as the subject? Hands up. This is the interactive part. Just stand 
up so we can get a mic to you please. 
 
Student: From the point of view of being the hypnotized person, when you were 
actually talking about problems I remember thinking I’m not even sure I want 
to get rid of this. It’s an element of control, if you see what I’m saying. I’m 
saying do I really want to get rid of this? 
 
 
But when he was talking about it and you have these fixed thoughts, etc. and 
he went into the Mind Bending Language and described the problem, I’m 
thinking I’m frustrated by slow drivers. So, that’s my problem, and then he 
ended it by saying and that’s happy, and I just dissolved into laughter and it 
just went. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. Now let me just ask you this. As you think about the situation – I 
guess it was driving – what happens? Thank you. Okay? This is important 
because we’re now at a pivotal moment here. Thank you for actually doing 
the whole journey with us because you started at one point and now you’re at 
the other. Do you have any idea what happened inside your mind?  
 
Student: No.

90 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Do you have any thoughts about that in terms of oh yeah clearly you had this 
logical thing about this and that and so I can let it go and so on, or is it just the 
fact that when you think about it now it’s gone? 
 
Student: Yes, pretty much. I released it and it’s not important in the scheme of things. 
 
Igor: 
Here we come back to Michael’s questions – why?  
 
Student: It’s just not important. 
 
Igor: 
It’s just not important, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did you notice the shift happening and cementing in, in terms of the question 
we’re having here, but the key thing here is you spent most of the day today – 
and I thank you for playing with me with this – having your minds running 
around in circles like I’m not sure what this is all about, nothing’s really 
happening, it’s just all weird? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Only now that we’ve actually applied it to something practical. Now you have 
a test to figure out oh this happened. Now I know what opening the mind 
feels like with a purpose. You’ve not had a purpose all day, have you? So, it’s 
very difficult to evaluate it. It just spins around and it’s kind of weird. 
 
 
Of course it is because it’s a purposeless opening of the mind, shall we say, 
but now it’s a purposeful one, which means you’re going to be having a whole 
bunch of extra responses coming in, in whatever way you need to resolve that 
sort of thing and so on.  
 
 
So, you’re in the same place. You still have no idea what really happened. You 
still have no particular thoughts about it. There are no real conclusions, 
except that because it feels different you know that it’s just not important 
anymore, right? 
 
Student: Yes.

Igor: 
You don’t really know why. You don’t really know how. Have we had insight? 
Not really, but we have had change. Do you understand this? So, whilst you’ve 
been spending the day having thoughts you can’t quite think, this is the end 
result of it and it feels natural, doesn’t it? It feels totally natural to you. 
 
Student: It does. 
 
Igor: 
We’ve done this in a clunky way admittedly, but consider this. Imagine you’re 
having a similar conversation a little more covert, so it’s not quite as blatant 
as this, with someone who’s stuck in a problem, an idea that they can’t let go 
of.  
 
 
You just ask them a question like I’m curious about this and they’ll say you 
know you’re right. I really should do XYZ. You never mentioned XYZ, right? 
They just thought it was a great idea but they had it because it was waiting 
there all along. It’s just they were stuck or too stuck to see it, and that’s really 
the entire process of influence in a nutshell. 
 
 
We will elaborate on that to make it nuanced and simple, and there’s a lot we 
can do about taking a look inside someone’s mind to know exactly what to say 
and when to say it.  
 
 
That’s what the next four days are about, but right now you’re right on the 
cusp of understanding, having an intuition about what Mind Bending 
Language is and how quickly it works – and it is, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Give her a round of applause for that. 
 
Michael: One of the things that came with me in this exercise is actually to have it be a 
two-way exchange is that you do a magic trick and give it back and they go 
wow, and then they hand it back to you and then you spin it a different way 
and then it becomes this journey. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, and what we call that is a conversation, right?  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
92 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Michael: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Seriously, but it’s exactly that. This is important. I’ve got a cartoon that maybe 
I’ll show you tomorrow. Most people when they think about persuasion and 
influence, it’s a one-way channel. I’m going to do this to you until you do what 
I want you to do. 
 
 
That’s what people perceive it to be. We’ll talk more about how I look at the 
idea of influencing tomorrow and why I do that, and you’re welcome to adopt 
it or not as a frame of reference, but really you just hit on the heart of the 
method. It’s just an interaction. It’s a genuine conversation.  
 
 
That means both of you get to grow from it. Why should they be the one who 
gets all the positive change out of it? It’s fun, it’s interesting for you, it’s 
interesting for them, it’s a more human thing and – this is the beauty of it all – 
it fits in a totally covert conversational setting because you are just having a 
conversation.  
 
Michael: Exactly, and it’s actually more engaging. 
 
Igor: 
Sure it is because real stuff is happening, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I appreciate that, Michael.  
 
The Nature Of Memory 
 
Arthur: 
I’m just wondering supposedly if you bring up a memory or recall a memory 
and then whatever happens at that time to the memory, when it gets 
reconsolidated it’s now a changed memory. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, yes. 
 
Arthur: 
So, is this sort of working in the same way? You bring up that problem. 
 
Igor: 
It’s exactly the same thing. It’s the same mind, so the same mechanisms are 
working. Seeing as we’re on the subject of memories, let’s think of it this way.

All that really exists in whatever reality we can measure or test is right now, 
this moment.  
 
 
There is no future. There’s no past. The past has happened and it’s over. The 
future hasn’t happened yet. It’s just an extrapolation of the now. So, why on 
Earth do people have problems about stuff that happened before? It’s over. 
 
 
Let’s put it in a crazy scenario. Let’s say someone is holding me hostage at 
gunpoint for a week, and I’m a little bit unhappy about that. One might say 
I’m just a teeny bit scared but I’m not really scared because I’m strong and 
touch, but I might be a little bit scared because there’s a gun to my head. 
 
 
Now it’s over. I’ve been rescued and I’m home again but I can’t sleep. I keep 
thinking about that. I’m scaring myself. I’m having panic attacks. Why? It’s not 
happening right now, is it?  
 
 
There’s no purpose for it, is there? It’s because I’m bringing the past back into 
the present. Think about that word re-member, to put back together again, to 
re-member, to put the little constituent parts together again – and in 
remembering it, I’m revivifying it. I’m re-experiencing it and that’s why I’m 
scared because I never left that room. 
 
 
My body may have gone out but my mind is still in that room, and that’s 
where the problem is, absolutely. What we’re doing here – and of course this 
is a simplistic way of looking at it, I’m just giving you an example of it – is I’m 
interfering with the process of remembering it so that you remember 
something extra with it. 
 
 
For example, the state of mind or the state of consciousness that you’re in 
when recalling something will now attach to that memory and be part of that 
memory. This is by the way how people make things worse. They have 
something bad happen, they think about it, they make themselves feel bad 
and think about it some more.  
 
 
Now those extra bad feelings attach to the original bad feelings, which are 
original memory. Then, of course, they’re telling themselves why am I like 
this, why can’t a live a normal life, and they start beating themselves up, 
which is a really nice thing to do to yourself, just when you’re recalling the 
worst experiences you’ve had because that attaches there too.

Before you know it, you have the worst case of Quasimoto in your memories 
because there are these hunchbacked beasts with all kinds of evil stuff 
attached to it, and of course recalling that memory becomes painful, but isn’t 
the opposite also true? 
 
 
Who has heard the phrase that time heals all wounds? It’s not entirely true, is 
it? Some wounds time makes worse. They just fester because the 
consciousness that recalled those events attaches to those events and makes 
them worse. 
 
 
Those wounds that time does heal are the ones that you recollect when 
you’re in the best consciousness, a better state of mind. So now you have 
healing awareness, healing consciousness, healthy ideas around that so that 
slowly but surely that memory becomes less problematic. 
 
 
Sometimes it happens instantly like this and sometimes it happens over a 
period of time, which is why you know that moment you fell off your bike 
when you were five years old and skinned your knee and cried and cried and 
thought the pain would never stop – you’d laugh at that now. Then you 
couldn’t laugh at it, could you? But you laugh at it now because your 
consciousness has changed each time you recall it. As a result, it’s no longer 
traumatic for you.  
 
 
So yes, it is exactly one of the mechanisms going on here but there are of 
course other things we’re doing with this too. But that’s a fundamental thing 
that’s always happening. There’s no such thing as a memory. There’s only the 
process of re-membering, putting things back together again. That means 
each time you recall it, it will change. So, you may as well change it in a way 
that’s useful to you than not, right? Thanks for that, Arthur. That was useful. 
Are there any other comments or questions? 
 
Student: Even though you said it didn’t matter, we wouldn’t have thought of it if 
something didn’t matter in it. 
 
Igor: 
Of course. 
 
Student: What I discovered was it did stop mattering. 
 
Igor: 
Because now it really doesn’t matter. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
95 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: It really doesn’t. 
 
Igor: 
This is something I can only say to you guys. Most people out there would 
think I’m insane when I say this. Sometimes when something doesn’t really 
matter, it’s not until you realize that it doesn’t really matter that it really 
doesn’t matter, right? 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I will join you in that insanity. So, have you got a nice tangible 
experience of what it’s like to operate this thing called the mind? You might 
call it a brain. I don’t know if you agree with that a brain and a mind is the 
same thing.  
 
 
Some people do and some people don’t. That’s your particular brand of crazy 
you can adopt or not as you wish, but stuff clearly does happen, doesn’t it? 
And you’ve gone through a little journey today.  
 
 
You’ve gone through a journey from just thinking about Mind Bending 
Language being this clever language that does stuff, to realizing it’s got 
nothing to do with the language itself and it’s about what’s going on inside, to 
suddenly rediscovering that language is something wonderful to help shape 
those thoughts and ideas, to suddenly stop worrying about the language again 
and being more concerned about the ideas and then the language will express 
those naturally. 
 
 
There’s only one thing we have left to do, and actually you’ve been kind of 
doing it already in this afternoon session and we haven’t really talked about it 
so much. What I want you to do now is do basically what we’ve done so far 
already and repeat it, only this time we’re going to go freestyle. 
 
 
When we ask things like who are you, it’s relatively mechanical. It’s a set 
question. We know that question already. When we say things like anytime 
but here, anywhere but now and all that sort of stuff, that’s a little less said.  
 
 
We’re not used to these kinds of expressions, not in English at least, and so 
they have a more potent effect on us because we’re less likely trying to 
understand them in terms of the old reference experiences.

It’s a new question, therefore we give it new attention, but together we 
already constructed these lists. We actually have three lists of these ideas of 
sySTEMs.  
 
 We have the where are you list. 
 We have the anywhere list. 
 We have the here/there list. 
 
They’re the same essential things.  
 
Freestyle MBL 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like to do now is I’d like to just brainstorm with you. Just brainstorm 
a couple just simple words that we will call mind bending power words for 
now, words that express these kinds of mind bending ideas. 
 
On their own they mean nothing. Anywhere is not a mind bending concept, is 
it? It’s only in combination with other things that it becomes mind bending, 
especially in combination with things that don’t normally go together. 
 
If we’re going to look at the idea of space, what is it that allows us to 
understand how space works? What kinds of words? Here, there, this side, 
over, under. Think about this. These words that you’re giving us – aren’t they 
relationship words? They tell you how to relate, don’t they? If I tell you the 
dog chased the cat under the table, it means something different to the dog 
chasing the cat over the table. It’s a totally different picture in your mind. 
 
The essential elements of that sentence are the same, but the relationship 
between the dog and the cat have changed. I can change the order and say 
the cat chased the dog under the table. It’s the same words. Again, the 
meaning has changed as a result. 
 
Words like under and over are called predicates. You don’t have to remember 
that. You can if you wish to but I’m not going to take you back to fifth grade 
grammar lessons because they’re not particularly useful.  
 
Grammar is actually very useful, by the way. Just not the way it’s currently 
taught. What a strange thing. I don’t have a soapbox at all about this one, do 
I? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
97 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Space 
 
Over, Under, Across, Through, Beyond 
 
What I’d like you to do is just as a group, give me two or three spatial 
predicates, words that allow us to relate to space that we can list here just to 
play with in a moment. We already had some.  
 
I just taught a Mind Bending Language program for therapists for our trainers, 
and we concluded that the true essence of Mind Bending Language is going 
beyond the beyond. So, you get the idea. There are many, many words that 
express similar sentiments, and each one takes you to a different place 
spatially.  
 
Time 
Before, After, Until Now, Yet, During 
 
So, now let’s look at time. What are some words that express relationships in 
time? 
 
So, it is not difficult. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with the words. It’s 
just a list that I want to keep simple. You could generate a pretty long list of 
these if you had a few minutes longer. You’ll get that time, don’t worry.  
 
 
 
Energy 
 
 
Totally, Completely, Absolutely, Partially 
 
Energy is a little bit more interesting. It’s the one that requires a little bit more 
thought because we don’t really think about energetic relationships. How do 
we know what the energy of one object is compared to another? I’ve just 
given you the operative word there. How do you compare things? Which one 
is faster? Which one is more? Which one is less? Which one is stronger? 
Technically things like stronger and faster and so on are actually 
comparatives. They’re actually not necessarily predicates on their own but 
they do fit right in here. 
 
I’m going to try to stick to more general ones. Things like: 
 
 Only 
 Completely 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
98 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
This is a little bit of a stranger concept, isn’t it? Give me some other ideas 
which are in that vein. 
 
 Totally 
 Absolutely 
 
I’ll just try to skip the synonyms, not because they’re not useful. It’s just 
because I want to have more variety here. 
 
Student: Is. 
 
Igor: 
You’re actually correct. It’s not a predicate as such, but it is actually a huge 
relationship in terms of de-being, right? That’s getting into Kaczynski’s stuff, 
which again goes beyond the beyond of today.  
 
 Partially again. 
 
 
Beautiful. I love that one. That’s probably enough for here just so we don’t 
confuse the lists too much. Again, there are many more but you get the rough 
idea of what we’re talking about. 
 
 
 
Matter 
 
 
Everything, Only, Specifically, Every, Each 
 
 
Finally there’s matter. What kinds of things allow us to have a relationship 
between matter?  
 
 Everything 
 
I’ll present it this way so you get more of a psychological clue on it. I’m going 
to lead you a little bit on this. How can we pinpoint which matter we’re 
talking about?  
 
 Only 
 Specifically 
 Every 
 Each 
 
That’s enough for now. By the way, the Mind Bending Language Cards that we 
have in the back of the room have a whole bunch of these predicates in there, 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
99 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
including mind bending questions. It’s something we’ll talk about more 
tomorrow if you like. 
 
The point is it’s more for you to understand that this is a very simple way of 
generating these concepts, and you understand the distinction between them 
and how they relate to those four key elements of how we orient to our 
universe: 
 
1. Space 
2. Time 
3. Energy 
4. Matter 
 
Now what I want you to do is you have a choice of two discussions you can 
have. You can have what’s called the remedial discussion, which solves a 
problem like you just did; or you can have a generative discussion, which 
actually improves something that’s already working, so it makes something 
better, which of course goes right into the energy. 
 
How might we do this? Well, you let them pick. What do you want to do? 
Well, (a) I’ve got this problem, or (b) I’d like to improve this skill. Let’s say 
some of you have this crazy notion that you would like to improve the way 
you use language hypnotically.  
 
I know that’s a crazy notion that doesn’t apply to anyone in here, but if you 
were to have that, you can discuss a little bit what you mean by that, and you 
do exactly the same thing again only now you’re not limited to just these 
things here. You can use any of the stuff on these lists. 
 
The key here is to contrast predicates – or mind bending power words if you 
want to use those words – that don’t normally come together. I’ll give you an 
example if I may. 
 
Let’s suppose you want to become better at hypnotic language, so that’s a 
generative change. I ask what does that mean to you and he says I’d be fluent 
with it, I’d be able to talk with it and I just want to feel comfortable doing 
that.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
100 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
So, I’ve got some idea of fluency and comfort. Those are involved with it as 
words. Beyond that you don’t need to have much more. Then I can check in 
with you and say okay let me just see if I’ve got you straight.  
 
You have a certain amount of fluency with hypnotic language right now, and 
to the extent that you only focus on how much better you’re becoming, 
would that take you beyond where you are now? 
 
Can you feel it happening already? That kind of fits a rational conversation, 
doesn’t it? So, we’re starting to eek away from the clumsy, mechanical 
training wheels we started today with and we’re going towards the more 
freestyle conversational socially responsible way of communicating. 
 
I don’t mind if you go to town and put some really crazy spins on it or if you 
put subtle spins on it. All I care about is can you still track the same 
progression inside their mind in terms of their reaction to it. 
 
Remember that surfing we talked about where you throw an idea out and let 
it begin to peak, and when you see it peaking you throw the next idea out and 
so on? You do the same thing here. 
 
So, you don’t want to say okay so you want to be more fluent and only to the 
extent that you’re more fluent you’ll become more relaxed about it and 
comfortable too, right? 
 
That’s a jumble that makes no sense. There are complex ideas involved, so 
you may as well let them have time to absorb it. So, you’re telling me you 
want to improve your hypnotic language… only… to the extent… that you can 
feel more comfortable now… than you have been doing before. Is that right? 
Yes. 
 
So, only consider what’s underneath your desire to improve that… specifically 
in this situation… that goes far beyond anything you’ve considered right now… 
and it’s anything but that. 
 
You may as well throw some old things in there too. By the way, there is logic 
in that but it’s difficult to grasp onto, isn’t it? You know that what I’m saying 
makes sense at some level, but your mind’s kind of trying to grasp it a bit. 
Would that be fair to say? That’s why it’s working.

Do you understand the nature of the exercise? I’ll leave these word groups up 
for you. Not because you have to use these words. It just makes life easier for 
you because you can just pick one from the list. You can choose any word that 
conforms to the principles we used to describe that list. 
 
Take five minutes in total. Is that an easy thing to do? And then we’ll call it a 
day. Alright, off you go. 
 
How did that go? Was that fun? Who feels their mind kind of whirling around, 
clicking around and going oh I can put this here and that there. It reminds me 
a little bit of doing those fridge magnet poetry things when we were kids. 
 
Really what today has been about has been a crash course in the Advanced 
Covert Hypnosis method, in terms of just getting the language under your belt 
because we’ll need the language.  
 
These are our tools that will allow us to achieve certain results and hopefully 
predictable results as you go into the whole influence process and the 
protocols we’ll be discussing in the main portion of this method. 
 
You will of course appreciate that there’s a lot more that we can do with this 
language than today has allowed us to do, but I don’t want to overload you. I 
want to just give you enough to basically understand the core ideas that are 
going on, to appreciate what I mean when I say that it’s not so much Mind 
Bending Language; really it’s mind bending moments expressed through your 
language and how to construct those moments for people – which you’re 
actually getting quite skillful at doing. 
 
You’ve taken a whole journey, a whole progression. You started off this 
morning pretty clueless. You didn’t know what to say or what to do, asking a 
simple question like who are you or what are you.  
 
You learned all about the nuances that make that work. You can’t just ask it 
straight out. There are subtleties about how you ask it that make it more 
meaningful.  
 
You’ve learned how to expand that simple question to put what I would call 
the sySTEM spins around it – the reason I put the word spin in is because it 
does spin your mind out a bit, doesn’t it – and turn what may seem like an 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
102 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
innocent question into something much more profound that really starts 
shaking loose things that are inside you that you never knew were there. 
 
You learned to accentuate that and put it all together in a way that allows you 
to actually deal with genuine problems or real shifts in the state of mind that 
someone’s experiencing. That’s important because unless you can use these 
skills practically, they are just a sideshow or something interesting but nothing 
of real use or value.  
 
Believe it or not we really haven’t even scratched the surface on how to use 
this stuff yet. You’ve just had enough that you can be confident that you can 
track states of minds as they occur. You all have a reasonable competency 
with that. Would that be fair to say?  
 
You can see you when different shifts are going like oh I gotcha, or no I missed 
that one. I’ve got to reload that and reset it. Really all that we really wanted 
to lead towards is the point at which you can really do it freestyle where you 
can just use language of a certain style, but that gives you much more 
freedom to become socially adept so that you can use it in pretty much any 
situation. 
 
We’re not there yet of course. We’ve given you enough to appreciate that it’s 
possible. Would that be fair to say? And enough that you actually might be 
tempted to go home tonight and try it on your friends and family. Just 
remember they have to go to work tomorrow, so try it on strangers first. 
 
It gives you some more freedom to do things with it. Believe it or not 
everything we’ve done today – as important as it is and as valuable as it is – is 
practically meaningless, useless compared to where we’ll be going in the next 
few days.  
 
Who feels like they’ve had an important and interesting insight into people’s 
minds, your own included? Where we’re about to go tomorrow, when we get 
into the real heart of this process that I’m going to share with you, will leave 
this stuff cold in the dust.  
 
This is the playpen. This is Kindergarten and we want to go university. We’re 
going to skip high school. Too many teachers trying to teach. We will come 
back to these ideas at the very end of our journey together when we come to 
the actual Advanced Mind Bending Language For Influence Course.

We’re not on it right now. Right now we’re at the Mind Bending Language 
Crash Course Bonus Day because it sets the scene to allow us to do what we 
want to do in the next few days. 
 
We will come back to all of this stuff but only once you’re different. I believe 
Einstein once said that a problem can only be resolved with a state of 
consciousness that is different from the one that perceived the problem.  
 
So, only once you’ve learned to change your state of consciousness, we’ll 
come back to this and then this will really be something worth having. Who’s 
excited about that idea? In that case, you’d better be back bright and breezy 
tomorrow morning because we’ll start at 9:00 o’clock and we’re going to go 
down the rabbit hole. We’re going to meet Alice and then we’re going to 
realize that Alice is still in Kindergarten and want to grow up some more. With 
that happy thought, I’m going to encourage you to play with everything 
you’ve learned today.  
 
If you’re going to do it with your family, put a preframe around it so that they 
don’t think you’re nuts. If you do it with strangers, only put a preframe 
around it if they have the ability to call a police offer. Otherwise you can go 
nuts. 
 
I want you to just get used to playing with this language just so it’s in there, 
realizing that we’re not going to come back to this for a few days but when we 
do you’ll really be glad that you were familiar with this. Is that something we 
can do?  
 
Play with this purely as a fun exercise to do with people, not trying to get any 
particular result. It’s irrelevant. The only thing to look for is can you track 
those shifts in consciousness that we’ve been playing with today?  
 
 The glib answer. 
 The defensive dismissal. 
 The genuine thought process. 
 Those little crests of waves as those thoughts get to peak and a new 
idea comes over. 
 The way the mind spins out more or less as you do things. 
 The way a problem emerges and suddenly disappears again. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
104 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 The way a solution arises and again either amplifies or disappears 
again. 
 
Basically, can you track what’s going on inside someone’s mind just by talking 
with them and using some of this language to help you poke and prod things? 
If you can do that, we’re going to have a great time. I look forward to seeing 
all of you bright and breezy tomorrow.

DVD 4 – Accessing Deeper Unconscious 
Thoughts & How To Ask Searching MBL 
Questions 
 
Exploring The Mind 
 
Igor: 
Good morning, everyone how are we doing? Yes, who was having a good 
time? Who enjoyed themselves yesterday? Who felt like they’ve learned a lot 
yesterday? Now, I hope what we did yesterday – although, really, it’s a recap, 
it’s a crash course in the advanced covert hypnosis method, which, you know, 
all of you, the most of you have got the DVDs or access to the DVDs form.  
 
 
My hope is that, even though we covered the similar ideas in terms of the 
language and the spins and all that sort of stuff; that even those of you 
who’ve got more experience or have handled this, that you got something 
new out of it, that you got some nuances from it.  
 
 
And the biggest nuance that I would like you to understand is that it’s not 
about Mind Bending Language, it’s about creating mind bending moments, 
and language is one of the tools in the toolkit that you need to utilize to do 
that, right? 
 
 
Now, what I want to do today is I want to briefly – for today, at least – forget 
about Mind Bending Language, which sounds almost like a sin, given that we 
came all this way to learn advanced Mind Bending Language, so advanced it 
doesn’t exist anymore. 
 
 
But, the reason I want to forget about Mind Bending Language, for today at 
least, is because – well, it’s several reasons. One is I don’t want you to be 
blindsided by it. It’s a very useful process, but it does something. And I’d like 
for you to understand when that something is better, so when you use a 
language, you then are capable of using it strategically, rather than just 
randomly, right? 
 
 
So, we’re creating mind bending moments and language is one way to do it. 
There’s many ways to do this. As an example, for example – example for 
example, I like that – as an example, one of our, a friend of mine who’s doing 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
106 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Mind Bending Language as well, he was at the, I think it was Gay Pride, one of 
the Gay Pride festivals. And he was talking to a girl there who was lesbian, but 
her parents didn’t know. And of course, that intrigued him, to talk about how 
that is and what’s going on there and how come she’s doing this and so on.  
 
 
And somewhere in the discussion, she comes up with a magic phrase or idea 
that she is afraid – and you can assume why she is afraid – that if she comes 
out to her parents, they won’t love her anymore, right? And it’s that concern 
or fear that she might have.  
 
 
And this is a bit that is really charming, this is a bit that I really liked about – 
he told me that he really understands Mind Bending Language or mind 
bending moments. He didn’t say a word, all he did is looked at her and raise 
an eyebrow and just waited. And she looked back… “I guess I’m just being silly 
about that, aren’t I?” A week later, she emails him to say she talked to her 
parents and everything was fine. And she thanked him for that conversation.  
 
 
So, would it be fair to say that you’re doing Mind Bending Language without 
even using any words, that you’re really using advanced Mind Bending 
Language, right?  
 
 
 
Exploring The Mind 
 
 
Thinking v Thought 
 
 
So, what we’re really interested in then is not so much the words that we’re 
using, but what the effects of those words are, what’s going on. And one of 
the ways to look at that is to… think about the distinction between thinking 
and having a thought. What’s it between thinking and thoughts – assistants, 
could we have a couple of mikes, please?  
 
 
So, over to you, guys. What do you think would be a distinction between the 
idea of thinking and the idea of a thought? So, what’s the most obvious – 
could you stand up and apprehend, this is the interactive portion today; 
you’re going to have to work for this one. Stand up, so we can actually find 
you. There you go.  
 
Student: Well, thinking, thinking is a process. 
 
Igor: 
Thinking is a process? And?

Student: And a thought could be like an image of something. 
 
Igor: 
So, a thought is a completed thing, right, whereas thinking is an activity, is a 
process of something ongoing, right? This is a very important distinction; do 
you understand what I mean by this? Right? Thinking is going on and when 
you’re thinking, stuff is being created. When someone is thinking, they can be 
influenced. When someone has a thought, it’s done, it’s finished. No more 
energy is going into that.  
 
 
Really – and this is my opinion, you’re welcome to view it this way if you wish 
to, or not – in my opinion, a thought is merely a memory. You’ve already 
either made an effort to think that thought and create it, and you’re just 
remembering it again or what you’ve done is called an implicit learning. In 
other words, you just adopt a thought without thinking about it. In other 
words, you’re just accepting it as though it were true without ever considering 
or questioning whether it is actually true at all.  
 
 
We’re interested in thinking for several reasons. Number one, thinking gives 
you actual choice. Number two, thinking – being a process – can be 
influenced, can be changed, it can be, stay in one direction or another. A 
thought is completed. You’re done. There’s nothing you can do about it.  
 
 
Now, let’s look at this in contrast. I want to look at this idea in several ways to 
get at the heart of something which lies – well, at the heart of the whole 
influence process, of course – that it lies at the heart of some mind, how the 
mind works.  
 
 
So, we’ve got the idea of thinking and thought; we all kind of pretty much 
agreed on this idea. Is that okay? Well, at least we can agree for it enough to 
see where it takes us today, yes?  
 
 
 
Exploring The Mind: 
 
 
Thinking v Thought 
 
 
Knowledge v Information 
 
 
So, then, what is the difference between… What’s the difference between 
knowledge and information? Now, again, this one – stand up and wait for 
mikes – this one is possibly a bit more – it’s going to be a bit more opinion in 
it. I am, of course, opinionated and I’m happy to share it. But to you, what is 
the difference between knowledge and information?

Student: My way to define knowledge is also part of experience, which you only gain by 
having done it yourself. Information you can receive from anywhere.  
 
Igor: 
Right. So what’s the difference in between knowledge that you’ve actually 
had a personal experience – so it could be information there isn’t there? 
 
Student: There is information, but the difference being in the knowledge that I hoped 
to have is that experience of everything I have done before and just gone back 
to. That is getting information and how you’re having practical experience 
with that information and theory. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. I like that. All right. Does anyone else have an idea or wants to 
elaborate on that? So, stand up so we can get the mike to you. 
 
Student: I would just say knowledge is integrated information.  
 
Igor: 
I think it’s a great definition. It’s really what you’re saying as well, but just in a 
different way. Knowledge is integrated information. Right? Go ahead. 
 
Student: I would say that knowledge can be classified into three distinct areas.  
 
Igor: 
Go ahead.  
 
Student: First is fantasy. They’re all equal. The second is theory. And third is fact. And 
most – to my experience – most of its, all our information and knowledge is 
theory and fantasy, very little fact. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, you have a very interesting way of looking at this whole idea of 
knowledge, information, what we know, what we don’t know, what we think 
we know and so on. Right?  
 
 
And what I’d like to do, again, for the purpose of today is I’d like to go more 
with this distinction here in terms of knowledge and information. And the 
reason why I’m pulling this out is not because I disagree with you, I think what 
you’re saying is actually correct. It’s just that when we talk about these words, 
that we’re actually talking about the same thing, right?  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
109 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
If we assume, for the purposes of today, that knowledge is information that 
you integrated, which means, really, it’s information that you have been 
thinking about enough to understand it.  
 
 
A monkey can be trained to memorize information, right? It doesn’t mean 
necessarily that he understands it or can do anything with it. A computer is a 
wonderful at storing information or retrieving information. It doesn’t mean it 
can do anything with it, unless you tell it what that is.  
 
 
So, that something that we do in our minds when we are thinking about 
information that somehow converts it into something useful, and that’s what 
we call knowledge.  
 
 
And the reason why I want to make that distinction – if we can use that as a 
description of knowledge and information. I know that different people will 
have slightly different nuances with that word. The reason why I want to pull 
that out is because… there is, I think, a mistake again – and this is, again, 
going back to what schooled us – we test for information. When we ask one: 
“How knowledgeable are you?” we really ask him: “How informed are you? 
How many facts do you know? How many supposed facts do you have?”  
 
 
And we mistake someone who has a lot of facts with someone who knows a 
lot. There are some people who know very few facts, but have a lot of 
knowledge. They understand those facts very well.  
 
 
So, there’s something intrinsic in the idea of knowledge, at least the way I 
would like to use it today, that involves the idea of thinking as opposed to 
thought. Information on its own could just create a thought, right? 
 
 
We’d like to know, by the way, one of the easiest ways to get people to have a 
thought without thinking about it, right? It’s called – actually, you turn on the 
news and you’ll see it. In fact, turn on the political news and you’ll see it. The 
last few years, I’ve seen a rise in the sound bite, where you hear the exact 
same phrase and quotes coming up over and over and over and over… Does 
that remind you of something? Hypnotic repetition? The law of compounding 
effect? The uncritical acceptance of an idea? 
 
 
Now, this is going to some interesting territory. So, we can create, we can 
develop thoughts and information hypnotically, but – this is the important 
part, this is where the influencing element comes in – if you get some thinking

and knowledge going, it changes a personality with it. Because now there’s 
taking responsibility for it, it becomes more real and they do something with 
it. Do you kind of follow where I’m going with this?  
 
 
 
Exploring The Mind 
 
 
Thinking v Thought 
 
 
Knowledge v Information 
 
 
Education v Indoctrination 
 
 
So, of course, the next idea which is related to all these will… make a total 
sense at this point, but again – there’s the actual subtle distinction, which 
may not be immediately apparent.  
 
 
We think we call what happens in schools is education, don’t we? We call 
what happens in cults or in certain groups like the military indoctrination. It’s 
become a synonym for brainwashing, has it not? But do you want to know 
what indoctrination really means? Just in terms of the word roots and how it 
was originally used and how it’s still defined when we take away the cultural 
associations we’ve adopted over the last 30 or 40 years.  
 
Student: Imposing a doctrine? 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. The key between education and indoctrination starts, first of all, with 
these starting letters, the I and the N. Both words come from Latin roots. 
Education comes from educo, which means – or ex, to pull out of, and duco, 
ducere, meaning to lead. So, it’s the idea of drawing something out of 
someone.  
 
 
Induction, on the other hand, or indoctrination, rather, come from in – and 
doctrination element comes from the same root as the word doctor, which 
means teaching information or ideas. So the whole concept of indoctrination 
is about putting ideas into someone. The idea of education is about drawing 
ideas out of someone. Do you understand the distinction?  
 
 
And I’d like to get past the idea of the pejorative that we have or idea of 
indoctrination to make use of the terms that we’re doing here. So, you can 
see again, indoctrination is linked to the idea of information, the idea of 
thought, whereas the idea of education is linked to the idea of knowledge and 
the idea of thinking. Because there’s other things that’s going on, the other 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
111 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
mechanisms occurring. Now, both of these are useful, by the way. Please, 
don’t think that indoctrination on its own is a bad thing. 
 
 
You’ve been to my seminars before; you’ve listened to audio products and so 
on. Much of that information is indoctrination in this sense. In other words, I 
have information, I know “know how” knowledge that I’m trying to transfer to 
you and I’m presenting it to you like a textbook. A textbook is indoctrination; 
it presents it to you. 
 
 
Education makes it your own. So, one of the things that I try to do here, for 
example – and actually, one of the things I’m going to encourage you to strive 
for in the influencing process in general is to have a balanced mix of education 
and indoctrination, because there are certain information that they will need 
to speed things up, but they have to make it their own.  
 
 
So you have to be able to pull it back out and to make them have, to make 
them think about it, as opposed to merely have a thought of it. Does this 
distinction make sense t you guys? 
 
 
By the way, what I’m doing right now? Am I educating or am I indoctrinating? 
 
 
Yes, for those of you who are saying yes, I agree with you.  
 
 
Right? I am presenting to you a point of view which is a particular doctrine, so 
I am presenting it to you; but I’m also asking you questions about it to get you 
think about it and decide for yourself how it fits for you. And that’s the way 
how you can work with, like, larger groups to do this. 
 
 
Now, this brings us to the final of this series. And this is really going to drive 
the rest of the day. So, we have a question over here. Could we get a mike 
over here, please? All right, stand up so we can get the mike to you. 
 
Student: In terms of indoctrination, do you think you’re an example of how you would 
use indoctrination with us, with this course? 
 
Igor: 
Well, I’ve been doing so already; I’ve just defined indoctrination for you.  
 
Student: Without the education…  
 
Igor: 
Say it again?

Student: Like, let’s say you take the extreme on the actions. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. So, indoctrination comes from the word in and the same root as doctor, 
which means idea learning, teaching and so on. So you’re putting ideas into 
someone. Do you all understand that? Yes? Great, let’s move on. That’s 
indoctrination. I’ve given you a fact I’ve given you a definition. You use very 
little brain power to make sense of that.  
 
 
If I’m going to do this in an educational process, I would ask you what do you 
think indoctrination means. Do you know what the in means? Which direction 
does that go? What does that do to someone? Doctrination, what does that 
remind you of? What other words sound similar to that? What does it mean 
for example, let’s say you talked about doctor, what does it mean to be a 
doctor? Do you know what that root means? Now, you have to remove – if 
you don’t know that, I’ll have to do some indoctrination to give you some 
information.  
 
 
 
Well, it comes from the same root, it means learned. That’s what a doctor 
actually means. That’s why a PhD is a doctor, even though he doesn’t do 
medicine – it has nothing to do with medicine, it has to do with being learned. 
Right? 
 
 
So, the education process and the indoctrination process both are useful. But 
the fundamentally work in different ways. And this brings us to the final of 
these four sets. We should really look into the same concept in a different 
way. And by the way, feel free to elaborate on your question, if you want to 
have done this little bit.  
 
 
 
Exploring The Mind 
 
 
Thinking v Thought 
 
 
Knowledge v Information 
 
 
Education v Indoctrination 
 
 
Questions v Answers 
 
 
And as for the distinction between… questions and answers… The educational 
process is only about questions, using questions for them to find answers. The 
indoctrination process is only about answers, and it prefers information and 
knowledge.

Now, you do, you require a little bit of both. If you have nothing, no 
experiences, you’re a black slate, remember nothing, recall nothing, you don’t 
even know language, right? In which case, you can't even work with that. So, 
you do require some indoctrination in areas, but to make it useful, to make 
that information become knowledge. So it become knowledgeable rather 
than informed, so that you have a practical application of it, you have to 
internalize it, you have to integrate it in some way. You have to have an 
experience of it in some way. 
 
 
 
And it takes us right back to that very first line, the difference between 
thinking and having a thought. The real thinking, in my opinion – you’re 
welcome to, again, think about this; agree or disagree as you wish – but my 
opinion on the idea of thinking, actual thinking, is driven by questions. If you 
have no questions, you cannot actually think.  
 
 
Everything else is a thought, because that’s an answer; you’ve already got a 
conclusion going on there. Do you understand the distinction we’re drawing 
out here? 
 
 
Do you see how all these four things; these four parallels are actually 
addressing the same issue from a slightly different point of view? Does that, 
by the way, answer your question about education and indoctrination?  
 
 
And this is the… beef, if you like, I have. This is why you get on my soapbox 
about what we call the educational system. It’s not; it’s misnamed. It’s an 
indoctrination system. There’s very little education that actually occurs, 
because it’s all about – the waiting on it is about the answers. The waiting is 
about the information, the facts that you can memorize. The waiting is about 
how many thoughts you can recall at the right time, i.e. an exam for a 
standardized test, and that’s what you get evaluated on.  
 
 
Just to be clear, I’m not knocking the idea of indoctrination; it has its place 
and it has its value. I could not teach a group this size purely using the 
educational process, because there’s too many minds going in different 
directions at the same time. I need an element of indoctrination, so that we 
all have similar thoughts and then, from that shared platform, then I can start 
educating, for you to start thinking about your own directions to go with this.  
 
 
Does that make sense to you, guys?

So, if you’re that influential, you’re going to be able to get inside someone’s 
mind, that makes sense, doesn’t it? If you’re going to get into someone’s 
mind, you’re going to need to understand what are the thoughts that they 
already have so you can… decide which ones are those that are useful to you 
in terms in the influencing process you want to go through or which are those 
that are in your way that you need to turn around.  
 
 
If a thought is actually already useful, then you leverage of it, you came to 
think about that thought in a useful way. If the thought is not useful, if it gets 
in the way, blocks something, keeps them stuck, then you have to turn that 
thought back into thinking and then you have to read or write that thinking 
into a new line of thinking about things so the new thought can emerge, 
which is kind of what happened yesterday when you did the last exercise or 
the almost last exercise.  
 
 
You know, as you think about the problem, who are you, everything beyond 
this and yada, yada, yada. Really, all you’ve done at that point is taking the 
thought – I recall the car coming in front of me and I feel bad – that’s several 
thoughts you’re having and the emotions are rising about. 
 
 
Think of it this way: how can you have a felling about a car moving in front of 
you? You have to have a complex layer of thoughts in place to be able to 
evaluate that event as meaning something that you should feel bad about, 
right?  
 
 
 
So, this is the real layered cake of things. You can't have an emotion without 
having a thought, because the thought will determine how you perceive 
something, so that you know how to feel about it.  
 
 
Now, notice, I did not say you can have an emotion without thinking; you can 
have plenty of emotion without thinking. In fact, that’s often the problem. It’s 
the thought, the thought that already pre-exists, the ways you reference the 
world with things, meanings and so on. So that when someone cuts in front of 
you, one person may think of themselves: “Oh, I’m so lucky he didn’t hit me!” 
and get on with their day and feel blessed. And the other person will go: “This 
person is getting too close to me, that’s dangerous!” and they’ll spend the 
rest of the day feeling cursed.

The same event, but the difference is a pre-existing thoughts, it0s the matrix 
of them that allows someone to have an emotional reaction because it means 
something now.  
 
 
So, in the process of influencing, we need to flush out what thoughts are 
existing, we’re thinking if any is occurring and if none is occurring, how can we 
stimulate thinking about certain thoughts to help steer them towards useful 
thinking and creating useful thoughts?  
 
 
Isn’t that a nice, abstract way of thinking about the influencing process? So, of 
course all of this is completely useless and pointless unless you have an 
experience, because right now it’s called indoctrination. I’ve made a logical 
sounding argument; you should all nod to and go: “Yes, that sounds right.” 
And every single one of you will probably forget within 24 hours that this ever 
occurred unless you can make this thought your own, unless you can translate 
it into something that is meaningful and useful to you. And that’s going to 
require some thinking.  
 
 
So, how do we do that? Well, the answer is right there. It’s in the idea of 
questions.  
 
 
I’d like to have a volunteer for this next bit. Can we have a volunteer, please? 
Someone? You’re going to come up? Give a round of applause, please. Can we 
have a mike from there here, please? 
 
 
Come on up here. There you go. Is this on? Here you go. Have a seat. 
 
Student: Here? 
 
Demo: Thoughts Vs  Thinking 
 
Igor: 
Have a seat over here. So…(she sighs) I agree. We’re interested in thoughts, 
are we? We’re interested in what thoughts exist and what thinking exists. And 
there’s no way we can even begin to influence someone until we know what 
we’re dealing with. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
So, what we’re going to start doing now, for the rest of the day, I want to go 
through a systematic process of investigating thoughts and thinking and 
figuring out a way how to – in other words, externally, you’ll be probing 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
116 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
people’s thoughts and their thinking, whilst internally learning how to assess 
those thoughts and thinking so that it helps you to strategically decide where 
the influence occurs. Right? 
 
 
So, we’re going to start in a very simple place. You are here, Linda, of course, 
in a Mind Bending Language Seminar. What I’m curious about is how come 
you came? 
 
Linda: 
Because I wanted to learn how to… embody this. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Could I just pause you – is it okay, I paused now – is it okay if I 
pause you from time to time to talk to everyone about what’s going on? 
Because we’re doing two things at the same time. I’m demonstrating, but 
actually – that’s the probing element – but we ought to build assessment as 
well.  
 
 
Now, when we’re assessing, notice what I’m not doing is I’m not putting 
judgment on what I’m about to do. So, I don’t have a judgment about what is 
coming out. What I care about is what is the nature of the thought, of the 
thinking that’s occurring. So, understand we’re actually going inside Linda’s 
mind, right? 
 
Linda: 
Right. 
 
Igor: 
Now, first I want you guys to really notice this. Do you notice how everything 
we did yesterday is coming back now? Did you notice the point in which she 
was thinking and a point at which a thought was being expressed? 
 
Did you see that happening? So, let’s see these follow again. So, you came 
here because of what, remind me again? 
 
Linda: 
Because I wanted to learn how to embody Mind Bending Language. 
 
Igor: 
Right, is that a thought or is that thinking? That’s a thought, right? And the 
reason we have that as a thought is because she did thinking a few moments 
ago, when I first asked it. Right? She didn’t have to do a lot of thinking, which 
follows as what? It’s not the full story. Right? It’s a start of a story, it’s a useful 
thing, but we haven’t really hit the pay dirt yet have we? So, you want to be 
able to embody Mind Bending Language, is that right? 
 
Linda: 
That’s right. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
117 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
So, what’s the point of embodying Mind Bending Language? 
 
Linda: 
I believe it can make a difference in my life.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, how? 
 
Linda: 
I know that it can make a difference others. 
 
Igor: 
So, how could it make that difference? 
 
Linda: 
How it can make difference in my life is… the thoughts indoctrination that are 
no longer serving me, that aren’t really where I want to be; I can find another 
way to use those. And if I know how to do that by myself; that experience, 
then I can help others do that. 
 
Igor: 
So, really, if I’m going to say it correctly, you’re here to help people, initially 
yourself, to kind of experience to understand how that works from the inside 
and then to help others to experience that also so they can have those 
releases also. Is that right? 
 
Linda: 
That’s correct. 
 
Igor: 
So, what’s important about that? How come that’s – it seems, obviously, you 
care this, right? 
 
Linda: 
Yes, I do.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Did you see what happened there? Did we just hit a different layer 
of the layer cake? How do you know? A different tone, a different – there’s an 
emotional component that’s increasing as we’re asking this question – can 
you see that? You can tell in terms of – her eyes are more shiny. I’m not quite 
sure that’s a technical term, maybe it’s increased lacrimation that is not 
actually turning to tears.  
 
 
I don't know. But, you know, there is a change in the quality of the eyes, the 
facial expression – we would call in normally, it lights up – there’s a great 
animation in the facial expression and move movement, the tonality has 
changed, the pace of the language has changed.

So, we’re hitting something of greater importance, are we not? Yes? Do you 
also notice how there are some thinking that has to occur for these things to 
start coming out? These are not something easy for you to answer, even 
though, you know, you have to do work to get the answers even though you 
kind of are familiar with the territory. Would that be fair to say? 
 
Linda: 
That’s right.  
 
Igor: 
Okay. So, I apologized to you in the middle of saying something, in terms of 
why all this is important to you.  
 
Linda: 
Yes, I was in the middle of it, but it wasn’t quite long – 
 
Igor:  
I know. So, what was it that you were trying to express? That this – obviously 
something was going – now, notice, I’ve entrapped a thought, the thinking 
process. A thought hasn’t formed yet, do you notice that? I am now asking for 
a thought, but there’s nothing there, that’s where the difficulty comes from. I 
have to reengage the thinking process to help her get back to the thought 
that she was beginning to evolve. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
 
So, you want to learn Mind Bending Language, you want to be able to embody 
it, correct? So, notice how I am reestablishing the same path she’s been down 
to point in the same direction again. You want to initially learn it for yourself, 
to experience the release of, you know, ideas that don’t serve you anymore. 
So, it’s personal, but then, of course, apply that to other people to help them 
release those negative ideas, thoughts, indoctrinations and so on, that don’t 
serve them anymore. 
 
 
And when you talked about that – I hope you don’t mind me saying this – you 
seemed very, it seemed very important to you, it seemed that you are 
attached in an important way, that it’s something very important for you, 
right? What I’m curious about is what is that? What is that thing it does for 
you as a person, to be able to help yourself and others let go of these ideas 
and all that stuff? 
 
Linda: 
You mentioned the word “evolve”, and I’m not quite sure how it fits with that. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  
 
Linda: 
But I believe that, as one of us evolves, it holds space for the rest of us. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
119 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
So, as one person, one individual, evolves, it creates space, as you say, or an 
opportunity for others to also evolve or something else? 
 
Linda: 
Yes.  
 
Igor: 
I don't know what’s important – 
 
Linda: 
Whatever “evolve” means for that person. 
 
Igor: 
Right. Well, what does it mean to you? 
 
Linda: 
Well, that’s a really good question; I’ve been exploring that problem my 
whole life.  
 
Igor: 
Right.  
 
Linda: 
I don’t have a real answer. 
 
Igor: 
That’s not what I’m looking for, anyways.  
 
Linda: 
Okay.  
 
Igor: 
So, what would be a crude way of saying what evolution or evolving means to 
you? 
 
Linda: 
Well, I’m not sure this is the crude way, but I believe that “evolve” means to 
get past the band of bullshit.  
Igor: 
Right. I like that. Nice alliteration, band of bullshit.  
 
Linda:  
That would be creating – 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Linda: 
Of something crude. 
 
Igor: 
And then, what’s the point of getting past this band of bullshit? I mean, 
people are doing it a lot, so the feeling must be – maybe it’s important to 
them. So, what’s important about moving past it?

Linda: 
Maybe it’s indoctrinated into it.  
 
Igor: 
Okay. So, tell me a bit more about that. What is it about getting past a band of 
bullshit that’s important? 
 
Linda: 
Well, I think there’s another space in place and time. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Linda: 
Once you’re past that band. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Linda: 
But you get more clear in clinging from remission.  
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Linda: 
And… Just different space. 
 
 
Igor: 
Right. And what is that different space, what is value of that space? Because it 
seems very valuable. I understand that you’re getting something very 
important and- 
Linda: 
 Like, like, spiritual space. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you.  
 
Linda: 
A space of the spirit. 
 
Igor: 
Right. Right. Now, do you notice how – can you see the slow transformation 
occurring here? Am I influencing or not? It doesn’t look like I am, but really, I 
am. I am leading the conversation a certain way. I will talk more about the 
tools for this as we continue.  
 
 
However, the main thing I want to focus for this portion right now, just to 
begin this process, to make it more educational, is… I mean, let’s put it this 
way – feel free to answer yourself – let’s have a microphone just, ready for 
the audience. There’s a pattern in terms of a scheme I am exploring in terms 
of the type of probing that I’m doing. Has anyone noticed what the theme of 
the pattern of this particular style of probing has been? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

The particular pattern? Stand up so we can get a microphone to you. We’ll get 
a mike to you; there you go. 
 
Student: You’re trying to find out what it really gets for her as you go upscale. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. So, we’ve gone, there’s some kind of a hierarchy I’ve gone 
through, right? And you actually have hit the right point, but I want you to 
elucidate it to make it crisp and precise for people to get. So you’re exactly on 
the right track; can you evolve that thought a little further? What do you 
mean, so what is a purpose of me doing this? What am I looking for? 
 
Student: To find what the ultimate purpose of her being here. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. And what do you think is my purpose in finding her purpose? 
 
Student: If you know what her purpose is, then you can help her to clear whatever it is 
that’s – 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, what we’re looking for is the fuel that runs everything. It’s called 
motivation, right? We’re looking for motivation and purpose. Without 
motivation, you do nothing. There’s not a single thing in your life that you do 
without motivation, unless it’s an automatic functioning system, like hear 
beating or stuff like that, right? 
 
 
Any voluntary act you’ve ever engaged in has motivation that drives it. 
Without motivation, there is no influence. Or is there? Please, feel free to 
disagree with me on this point.  
 
 
So, one of the fundamental things; we have a tapestry, a network of thoughts 
and thinking that occurs inside of human being. If I wish to influence that 
human being, I must have a good understanding of what that tapestry looks 
like.  
 
 
Now, what we’ll be doing here for the rest of today is exploring that tapestry 
from different points of view, different perspective, different elements of it, 
focusing on different types of qualities of information, so we can have some 
knowledge about how people think and how their mind works.

And the purpose of that is not – let me repeat this – the purpose is not for you 
to spend, you know, two, three hour on interviews for the rest of your life; 
you’re going to influence someone. There will be a place for that, absolutely. 
I’m not saying that you never do that.  
 
 
But, you all acquire something from it, that we’re likely to influence someone 
in five minutes or less, and I mean in a big way.  
 
 
I’ll give you an example of, a specific, concrete example, if I may, of this. 
Again, another friend of mine, a student of Mind Bending Language, set the 
challenge of going out to studying new business, studying out to get to 
meetings where people go, you know, through meetings and on the – rather 
than topic.  
 
 
And within five to 10 minutes of meeting a perfect stranger – that particular 
meeting grace – to turn them into a client, a paying client for her services. 
Five to 10 minutes with a complete stranger. Does that sound impossible? Or 
it sounds a little difficult – any salespeople in the room? Isn’t that, like, the 
Holy Grail of sales in many ways?   
 
 
By the end of this, by the end of the program we’re on right now, you will 
know exactly how he did that. 
 
 
So, I want you to answer the question, what the heck was he doing there? 
Because one of the things – and this is the key thing – is what we’re starting 
to hear is without motivation, there is nothing, right? So, you understand the 
nature of the conversation that Linda and I just had, yes? We’re looking 
specifically for motivation and purpose. I am paying attention to which 
elements that I’m getting back are pre-existing thoughts and which elements 
do you have to think about. 
 
 
If the thoughts are useful, I’ll utilize them, absolutely, but I’ always going to 
encourage the element of thinking because I know – let’s face it, human 
beings are lazy. There’s a lot of stuff that happens in our lives. We take 
shortcuts. So, I know that if I only stay at the level of the thoughts that are 
immediately available, that I’m missing the real juice, right? And Linda, let me 
ask you, did you feel an emotional change as we progressed in that hierarchy 
of questioning? 
 
Linda: 
Yes. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Igor: 
Would you like to say a few words about what that was for you just so that 
they have a sense of that? 
 
Linda: 
I went from… thinking, thinking, thinking it might be possible all along to “Oh, 
yes, that’s what I want!” It’s a felt sense for me.  
 
Igor: 
So, there’s motivation there? Something else is going on in there as well we 
shall address after we do the next exercise, because I want to separate this 
relatively complex idea of thinking and thought. It seems so simple, but 
actually, there is a lot of stuff going on with that.  
 
 
We’re going to separate those different things as we go through the day. But 
for right now, does everyone have a clear idea of how to repeat this kind of 
exercise with someone else? Yes? Any questions about that so far? 
 
 
The way I want to do it is this, I’d like you to get into groups of three people. 
You have different roles and you’ll each get a chance to just swap the roles: A, 
B and C. A will be a questioner, B will be questioned and C will get to – I guess 
– see what’s going on.  
 
 
I know it’s a nice point isn’t it? Give me some credit.  
 
 
The whole point of this is – oh, and by the way, first of all, thank you very 
much, Linda. Give her a nice round of applause. I appreciate that, thank you 
for coming along. 
 
 
So, the whole point of this is A is going to explore the thoughts and thinking 
patterns of B. B, your job is easy, actually, it seems easy, but it’s actually the 
hardest. Your job is to give responses to whatever the questions have come 
up.  
 
 
I’d like for you to address the same topic we did here, which is the motivation 
for being here, to learn Mind Bending Language and for no other reason than 
– it means we have something communal to talk about when we come back 
from the exercise. That means everyone is going to be starting from the same 
place and ending up in different places. And it shows you a little bit about 
patterns in the way of thinking and thought.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
124 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
B, of course, will be the material you’ll be working with. C’s role will be to 
evaluate two things, how well was A probing B’s thinking. Did they stay on 
track, did they lose focus, were you impressed by the particular question? Did 
you notice B giving them a clue about something and A didn’t take it up? 
What are you noticing? 
 
 
Second thing is to assess the quality of B’s thinking. In terms of assessing it 
right now, the only measure for assessment I’m interested in for this exercise 
is just clarity of thought. Are they clear and are they relatively concise? If 
someone has to waffle on for half an hour, there’s no great clarity there. If 
they can present it in a very – if they can say it in two words in a way that just 
really sums it up and really picks it, that’s someone who’s really been thinking 
about something and had a clear and lucid thought as a result. 
 
 
Do you understand what we’re talking about here? So, once again, to recap. A 
will ask questions, probing B’s thinking and thoughts, specifically about their 
motivation and purpose for learning Mind Bending Language. B, you’ll just 
answer as best you can the questions that are presented to you. And C will 
observe interaction, evaluate how well or how on point A was staying. Did he 
miss anything, did he fall on some interesting train of thought or ask some 
interesting questions and assess the quality of B’s thoughts as they are being 
verbalized.  
 
 
Easy to do, simple to do? All right, guys, find yourselves into groups of three. 
Assistants, can you just help everyone out? If you do not have a partner, just 
put your hand right up in the air and that way is the quick way of getting 
partners. Groups of three, everyone, please.  
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Okay, guys. So, I’m presuming from a) the difficulty to get you back and b) the 
incredible buzz in the room that something interesting and enjoyable 
happened there. Would that be fair to say? So, tell me about it. What do you 
notice, what did you learn? What did you deduce from the experience you 
just had? Stand up and put your hand up. That’s good, up you get. Right 
behind you. 
 
Student: I was the last to go in terms of questioning.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Igor: 
Okay.  
 
Student: And I was able to take some time having been C. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. You’ve learned, of course. 
 
Student: I’ve learned quite a bit. And I discovered that when I felt that I got to where I 
needed to go. There was no need to continue, but I had got to a place where I 
thought there was a you know, I’d got to the meat of the matter and that was 
very satisfying, much more so than – 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, this is interesting, isn’t it? First of all, you can have a conversation 
where you do less, but actually get more out of it. And let me ask you this, did 
you find your conversational partner to be more interesting, now that you 
actually have something to ask them about, something to actually get 
information out of them? 
 
Student: Yes, there were a lot, you know, more animated. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  
 
Student: More engaged.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly. I have a friend of mine whose attitude is there’s no such thing as 
boring people, there’s just boring questions. And I think you’ve got a great 
example of that right now as well. And the other thing, from what you just 
said, which I think is very interesting is there’s a time when you really know 
when you’ve done what you need to do, when the influencing process is done 
and you need to shut up. 
 
 
Anyone here ever been so stale with a sense like they’re so keen to help you 
that really all that happens is you feel creeped out and you just want to leave? 
And what happens are the things like: “Ah, I feel too much pressure like, you 
know, I was here for, like, the joy of a pair of shoes and now, now I don’t 
know!” 
 
 
It’s because they’re saying too much. You came in, you know the shoes you 
want, you know the color you want, you know you’ve got them, you don’t 
care about the price. And they talk you out of it. That’s called, you know, anti-
influence, right?  So, knowing when to stop talking is a very useful thing.

Next question, go ahead. We’ll come over to this side after.  
 
Student: It was interesting to see really what drives people is something that’s often 
below their normal consciousness. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: Actually that posing a question brings their conscious into alignment with 
that. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, beautiful, you just gave me two very important things there. You give him 
a round of applause for that, this is very important. Believe it or not, this is 
why I love this method; you were actually going into what we we’re going to 
be doing tomorrow, so we may as well do it today.  
 
 
So, two very important things there. Number one, do you notice that the glib 
answers is the one that the least students and so on, and there’s something in 
the nature of forcing the person to think, because all questions force 
someone to thing, by the way. Whether they’re trying to reject it or not – 
their thinking process starts and maybe you bought it, but then you go back to 
it – ultimately brings out unconscious material. And usually you can tell, 
because there is more juice in them, especially motivation and so on, right? 
 
 
The second one, which I really like is – how many of you notice that 
sometimes a conflict between the first responses and the later responses and 
they go: “You know what? No, let me change my mind about that; it’s actually 
this, this is what I really want, right?”  
 
 
What do you think is going on there, Michael? 
 
Student: For me? 
 
Igor: 
What do you think is going on when someone comes out with this idea: 
“Initially, my motivation is this, but later, through questioning, they realize 
they have a deeper motivation that actually conflicts with the original one and 
they get to align with the deeper motivation? What do you believe is going on 
there? 
 
Student: Well, the conscious and the unconscious association is resolving.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
127 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Thank you, absolutely. Now, as hypnotist, what happens when the conscious 
and the unconscious mind conflict – is that a recipe for happiness? No, right? 
What you’re doing is – I mean, here’s another question, and feel free to 
answer this – or someone else can put a hands up for this if you like – where 
did the conflict even come from? 
 
 
How can they consciously thing that they’re being motivated by one thing, yet 
unconsciously the motivation, the one that really runs deep is something very 
different? How can that even happen? 
 
 
Pass it back to the lady over here.  
 
Student: One thought. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. Would you elaborate on that a little bit? 
 
Student: Well, the thoughts would be beliefs and that you have adapted or adopted or 
learned from teaching them – 
 
Igor: 
Right.  
 
Student: And thinking something, considered and made your own instead of 
conditional. 
 
Igor: 
One hundred percent spot on the money. Those thoughts are the things that 
you’re being basically conditioned like a lab rat, right? You heard it in the 
media, you flick through the magazines, you see all the beautiful people with 
the beautiful house and the perfect marriage and the perfect car and the 
perfect house and the perfect dog and the perfect 2-4 children, you know? 
 
 
These are thoughts that are bombarding us left, right and center. You never 
had – you’re thinking that you hadn’t had a chance to do anything with it, yet 
underneath the surface, this is something where we should go from Erickson, 
actually. This, where, this is informed, this part of the method here – that 
your unconscious mind has its own reasoning process, independent of the 
conscious mind and it can draw conclusions independently from the conscious 
mind.

And the ones that we care about are the unconscious ones, because they’re 
the ones that actually make your life a bliss or a misery.  
 
 
So, notice how we’ve done very little, and yet already, there’s integration 
that’s going on. We’re not really talking about therapy, right now, by the way. 
We’re still more interested in the influence process, but honestly, is there a 
real difference between a sale, between educating your teenage son or 
daughter to, you know, be home on time or not take drugs and all that stuff? 
Between helping someone overcome a phobia, between teaching someone in 
school to actually think, rather than just memorizing pre-crafted thoughts? 
 
 
Is there really a difference in the mechanisms there? If you think about it – 
and here is the idea to really just consider, and please, do consider this – 
we’re using the same machine, aren’t we? The same machinery is working, 
whether you’re changing the phobia or selling a pair of shoes or educating a 
child or correcting someone’s behavior or coaching someone or doing 
someone’s, you know, performance review in the business or recruiting a 
client.  
 
 
Aren’t we using the exact same machinery, which is the human mind? So, of 
course, they’re all going to run parallel tracks, they’re all going to look very 
similar, with just little nuances here and there. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
So think, that’s really, I think, important realization. There’s a hand over here, 
go ahead. 
 
Student: Yes, just –  
 
Igor: 
Are we done? There you go. 
 
Student: Looking for tips here, we found that in all three cases, we have gotten to your 
whistle and it was obvious that there was another important layer to go.  
 
Igor: 
Yep. 
 
Student: And it typically – the delay was that we were all talking too much. We were all 
giving longer answers. Any suggestions for cutting through that? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
129 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Sure. So – keep the microphone, you’ll need this – so, you think, one of the 
problems you’re having is that people were giving too many long-winded 
answers and that’s just cut your time out and so on. Is that correct? 
 
Student: Long, long questions. 
 
Igor: 
And long questions too, right? 
 
Student: We also had to try. 
 
Igor: 
So, what’s – you know, if you go past the longer questions, what do you get? 
Thank you. And aside from the questions you’re asking, which ones could you 
have asked? Thank you.  
 
 
Are you getting closer? So, aside from the questions you did ask, practice? 
How specifically would you practice? 
 
Student: Keep going. 
 
Igor: 
Doing what? Thank you. You see it happening right now. Right? The long-
winded questions, I just basically – people think normal questions would have 
gone with this, right? 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
Practice, of course, would help. Actually, it’s experience that will help more 
than practice, right? The main thing, though is – and this is something we 
may, we’ll pull it again later on today – is if you find that you’re stuck at a 
level, that’s when Mind Bending Language comes in again.  
 
 
Or another way of putting it is whatever you, we’re doing, don’t. You’re 
welcome. Can we just figure it until after we come in, because I think he’s 
going to add something here? Go ahead. 
 
Student: Can I just say, I think it’s very much for, like, reintegration and trying to get a 
thought process. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, that’s exactly, these are all parallel principles. You’re doing exactly 
that, yes. And for those of you who’ve been in conversation hypnotherapy 
program, you’re still doing the parts integration we’re shrinking up on 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
130 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
intention, this is the very similar idea. Actually, it’s identical, it’s just we’re 
looking for slightly different nuances information. So yes, go ahead. 
 
Student: This was the question, that was like, get out of jail, really – the question is – so 
what does that mean for you? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. There’s actually a bunch of questions – and I will happily give you specific 
questions that will help elude it on purpose. But right now, I’m more 
interested in you having experiences, right? And having thoughts about these 
experiences or rather thinking about those experiences enough to have 
thoughts worth thinking, right? Thank you. 
  
 
So, is this related or – or otherwise it’s another question I’ve already promised 
over here. Sort of related? Well we’ll take it quickly and then – under premise 
that I can skip it if it’s – because madam is waiting. Are you good? Okay. Done. 
 
Student: One thing that I noticed – and I am clear on whether you should allow to 
continue or try to stop – when people would think of an answer to a question 
and then you would ask for clarification, oftentimes you could see their body 
punch, they become defensive.  
 
Igor: 
Defensive? 
 
Student: Yes. But they were thinking. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. So – 
 
Student: To defend their answers. 
 
Igor: 
So, give an example. 
 
Student: When someone was asked: “Okay, why would you like to go in that 
direction?” And you could tell that maybe that wasn’t the end of the answer, 
there was more levels to go, but that was what they were defending as being. 
 
Igor: 
Right. And if you think about that now, that process, what do you think is the 
cause of that person becoming defensive of that particular rationale like that? 
Some of you’ve already spotted, I think, Cassie, I can tell has spotted it 
already. And the answers, you’ve given us information for it already I just 
wonder if you are aware of it, that’s all.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
131 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: That’s the question. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fair enough. So, what do you think is causing this person of becoming 
protective or defensive of the level of the answer they’re giving you, to be 
stuck on that level? And you – 
 
Student: Thought versus thinking. 
 
Igor: 
It’s kind of that, it’s actually – let me pass to Cassie, because she’s always 
jumping out of her chair trying to answer it.  
 
Student: I was a defensive person, so –  
 
Igor: 
Okay. In that case, we can go straight to that person, right? 
 
Student: Because I know that it’s myself being defensive. And the reason I got 
defensive was; it was the way the questions went that it started to go towards 
the unconscious level, and it’s only backed up back towards the conscious 
level.  
 
 
So, I felt myself going deeper, and then suddenly, l’ve seen as more the 
logistics of things, like more logic – I instantly jumped back logic, instantly 
went back to my defense.  
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Student: Because of the way the question was worded – 
  
Igor: 
And that’s exactly it. And we would like to know what the actual word was 
that caused that process happen? 
 
 
Student: Why.  
  
Igor: 
Thank you. Remember when we talked about this yesterday? Yes? And again, 
there’s nothing wrong with the question, you just got the exact results that 
that question tends to inspire in people. Right? It’s why asking him to justify 
and defend a certain position, it gets a more logical, you know, rationalization 
process going and that’s really – I mean, I get the whole dynamic and maybe 
there are other things involved as well – but who’s beginning to get a sense 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
132 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
that the questions that you’re asking have a lot of power and a small nuance 
can make a big difference. Does anyone begin to notice this? 
 
 
Yes? So thank you, both of you, for sharing that. We’re over here; I think Colin 
has been busting a gut also.   
 
 
Student: As the observer, I noticed every questioner attempts to give any influence for 
their opinion of it while the person is still in the thought process. There’s 
major resistance, big time. 
 
Igor: 
Right. Why do you think that is? 
 
Student: Because they’re still under a pre-conceived idea of what it was. And – sorry – 
she came out of it – no, that’s not what I meant and she was fighting it. With 
her mind to the questions, she was willing to go right into the – 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. So, what’s going on right here? Any ideas? So, up here? Good. 
That’s right. We already got a mike there. 
 
Student: My thoughts of the questions that we asked are not what you get, their 
deepest purpose of motivation; but, when we started to get to that point with 
some of the questions, it may cause a reaction, because a person is 
unconscious yet of what the real purpose of it is. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  
 
Student: You actually open the door to that; that’s unfamiliar to them. 
  
Igor: 
I agree with you and that’s actually a separate slice, separate topic for what 
Colin was talking about here. The situation we’re talking about right now is a 
situation where you’ve inspired someone to start thinking, again, about the 
motivations and so on. Now, before they come to a conclusion, before a 
thought forms, you interfere with that thinking process – I’m using that word 
very specifically – you interfere with that thinking process by presenting a 
thought that they might want to have. 
 
 
So, what you’re telling me is this and then they get very defensive. No, it’s not 
that. Imagine this imagine that you are in your favorite water park with slides 
everywhere, right? And for those of you who don’t like slides just pretend that 
you do. I’ve already screwed up my metaphor.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
133 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Now, you’re going on a slide; it’s all smooth, it twists and it turns and you’re 
having a great time. It’s fantastic, right? How do you think you’ll feel if 
halfway down the slide someone just jumps in, pulls you out and says: “Stop! 
Go on this slide, that’s better”? Enjoyable? It’s charring, isn’t it?  
 
 
What happens when someone is in the process of thinking and you interfere 
with a thought – now, you can interfere with the thoughts, by the way, to 
improve their thinking. The way to do that is to say: “It’s this, isn’t it?” That’s 
the way that it goes, kind of the indoctrination approach.  
 
 
The way that will work is to offer choices. So clearly, you’re thinking about 
this right now, I don't know which, but this is an Ericksonian idea. You could 
be thinking of it like this or like that or like this or any other way that haven’t 
been considered yet.  
 
 
So, you’re helping them to form their option rather than determining which 
option they should have. You see, people fundamentally – and I think this is 
true, pretty much for all people unless there’s another psychological 
disposition getting in the way – but you see, all people have a drive to some 
form of independence, to turn it their own way.  
 
 
And if you interfere with that too much, they’ll accept an element, there’s a 
contrasting point between what you’ve been taking care of to make a life easy 
for them and expressing their independence. It’s like a balancing point there. 
 
 
If you give them too much direction, if you try to be too controlling, they will 
fight, they don’t like it. And that’s exactly what you’ve been experiencing 
there. You were tending to control the thoughts at that point instead of 
redirecting them.  
 
 
And that’s what questions do very well. And I can guarantee this, for example, 
Colin, 90% of the time, if whoever plants the statement like “it’s this” in the 
form of a question “could it be this?”, then you actually might even succeed. 
They might even go: “Yes, you know what? You could be right about that.” 
 
 
Because instead of just [reacting] them out of their favorite water slide, 
you’ve just had little deviations like: “Oh, try this!” Like: “Oh, yes, I can 
switch.” You’re just taking a different turn, that’s all.

Does that make sense to you, guys? Now, we haven’t really spent that much 
time asking these questions and now we begin to notice that there’s a lot of 
depth, there’s a lot of stuff going on with even a very simple level of probing 
questions.  
 
 
There’s many more we haven’t even covered yet. But is this useful stuff? Are 
you beginning to see the value of this in terms of the influencing process in 
general? Yes? Over here, can we have a mike over here? Thank you for that, 
Colin.  
 
Student: It was just some, that’s point there – I thought one of the things also, that 
might be significant is that the speaker is very open and really wanting to 
explore other person as opposed to maybe describing judgment to some 
people. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Keys To Mind Bending Hypnosis 
 
Igor: 
So, there are some keys to being a great mind bending hypnotist. One of the 
keys is to ask questions, right?  
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions 
 
 
You’ve been doing this you understand the process going on. And the reason 
we ask questions is because questions induce thinking, suggestions induce 
thoughts. Do you understand the different parameters? 
 
 
If you’re going to be conversational, in other words, covert, your best bet is to 
induce the right kind of thinking because it’s invisible to them.  
 
 
It’s kind of like everyone’s seen that movie Inception? Yes? Thinking is 
inception. The way most people consider hypnosis, it’s about thoughts and 
suggestions and so on, is when that, the process doesn’t work out the same 
way, because people realize: “Oh, that’s not my thought.” Especially in a 
conversational setting. Right?

So, questions, so we’ll have the keys here. Question is one of them. The other 
one is the one you just mentioned there and I’ve got a nice, pithy thought for 
you right here. Oh, yes.  
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions 
2. Non Judgmental 
 
 
As soon as someone fears their thoughts or their thinking is being judged, you 
know how to defense a person. Because even our thoughts, not just our 
thinking, but even our thoughts feel very personal. Even if they’re not our 
thoughts, by the way, even if they’re just induced by you know, too much 
browsing the media, listening to the doom and gloom of the news so much, 
whatever it is, right? 
 
 
They still feel personal and an attack on your thoughts is perceived as an 
attack on your person, which is why you defend it. Thinking is not an attack on 
your thoughts. Thinking is inspiring the creation mechanisms inside of your 
mind to create new and better thoughts, and you always have the right to 
change your mind, don’t you? 
 
 
I don’t have the right to change your mind, but you do. That’s why we like 
using thinking here. And if you are judgmental about their thinking or their 
thoughts – well, how many of you enjoyed getting an F on your paper at 
school? 
 
 
Did that inspire you to keep going? That judgment –unless you use – there are 
exceptions, so there’d be rules, of course. You can use, be judgmental in a 
way that motivates people to prove you wrong. And I’ll show you how to use 
that in due course, right?  
 
 
But let’s go with the easy route for now, the general principle, before we look 
at the exceptions.  
 
 
If you’re judgmental of someone’s ideas, thoughts and so on, you’re basically 
attacking them at a psychological level. And that closes doors, especially the 
doors to the parts of the mind that you want to get to.  
 
 
Judgmental things can come in many different guises. How… how do you 
think people have been judgmental about your thoughts, your ideas, your 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
136 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
thinking processes in your personal life history, which were both obvious and 
some which were very subtle, that took you years maybe to figure out 
actually that was happening.  
 
 
Give me some ideas. Over here, this lady just stand up.  
 
Student: Well, yesterday, when we were doing that first exercise – I had it a couple of 
times when somebody asked me who I was and I said something and they 
said “No.”  
 
Igor: 
Did you enjoy that? 
 
Student: No, I didn’t, I felt negated. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. And you have the right to. What you’ve experienced is a defense 
mechanism in action it’s an emotional defense against a psychological attack. 
Now the person, you and I both know, the person did not mean to attack you. 
Right? 
 
Student: I don’t believe that they meant to say that you’re wrong. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  
 
Student: They were going to the next level of who are you really? 
 
Igor: 
Right. Exactly. So, what they really meant to say – and this is just a role play, 
this is a scenario, so we can get – they go back to the idea of language 
expressing an intention or a meaning better, right? So, you said whoever he 
was he said just – let’s play this: “Who are you?”  
 
Student: I am Ann. 
 
Igor: 
Right. Now, we’d say: “No, who are you really?” And you wouldn’t like that 
very much, right? 
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
So, I should get to the next version of this, wouldn’t I? Then you can use what 
I call Columbo approach: “I apologize, I’m sorry. I think you misunderstood 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
137 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
me. I know your name is Ann, I can read it on your name tag; what I meant 
was who are you?”  
 
Student: Well, that might have it, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Right? Same intention, isn’t it? I’m actually expressing the same idea; it’s just 
I’ve taken into account the perception of the idea. Right? I want to – because I 
do not want to risk coming across as judgmental, I’m going to be careful with 
the word – no, there are going to be times I will use it, of course. 
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions 
2. Non Judgmental 
3. Columbo Approach 
 
 
 
So, in this case – this is what I call the Columbo approach – do you the TV 
detective Columbo? You know he’s, like, little bumbling and asking all these 
silly questions, like: “Oh, oh, just – “my favorite one is, like, he’s always 
leaving the door and he’s like: “Oh, just one question!” Right? He just knows 
he’s about to nail them, right? But he played the low status card. This is the 
status game. If you say no, what’s my status, what am I assuming? High or 
low, compared to the other person? 
 
 
I’m dominant, you’re going to submit to me, I am high status, you’re low 
status. I forced a position on your role on you. Some people actually enjoy 
that, some people need you to say no. That’s what I meant, they’ll go: “Okay, 
tell me more, right?” What status, what position did I assume when I 
apologized that I’m really sorry, I misunderstood – what I really meant to ask 
was this: I have to get a low status – what’s more threatening, high or low 
status?  
 
 
High status, right? Because high status is about control, it’s about authority, 
it’s about command. If I’m going to be invasive – and again, you go to judge 
the character or the person a little bit, but overall, it is a general rule, a 
general rule of thumb, there are exceptions to everything – taking on that low 
role, that Columbo approach, the kind of bumbling fool, like: “Oh, I’m such an 
idiot. I totally misunderstood what you were saying. Could you please clarify 
this for me a moment?” It buys you a lot of leverage, they go: “Oh, you poor 
little idiot! Yes, I’ll help you clarify your thinking, right?”

Now, when it comes to the whole process of influencing, I don’t mind them 
thinking me an idiot, provided I came where I wanted in interaction. Right? I’ll 
be the village idiot any time of the day if it makes my life happy, more 
successful, makes me wealthier, gives me good friends and so on, right? 
 
 
So do you understand the nature of the Columbo approach and how there’s 
really an expression of the principle of being non-judgmental about the 
thoughts and the thinking occurring inside someone else? Now, what happens 
if you have a real values clash, if what they’re talking about is so offensive to 
you; what do you do with that? Well, go ahead, over here.  
 
Student: I’d say observe. 
 
Igor: 
Observe, right? So, I presume what you mean by that is you observe yourself; 
you become more of a witness rather than getting involved in your emotions, 
is that kind of what you meant? 
 
 
Student: Yah. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. And I agree with you. Really, think of it this way… One way to look at it 
is that you could be right or you could get your own way.  
 
 
Again, another internal principle is the idea that would you resist or persist? 
Would you accept your gained power to transform? So, you find that idea 
offensive, there’s no point arguing with them over it. How many times have 
you argued with someone and really persuaded them; they’d go: “there’s no 
point arguing with them over it. How many times have you argued with 
someone and really persuaded them; they’d go: “You know what? Yes, you’re 
right. Thank you for tearing me a new one. You’re 100% correct, I am totally 
wrong. I apologize profusely.” It’s very rare, isn’t it? 
 
 
What’s the most usual result of you getting emotionally involved in an 
argument they get equally involved on their argument, don’t they? Even if it’s 
totally irrational. And then of course, both of you get very irrational because 
at some point you lose connection to your neo cortex and just argue form 
your limbic system, which is basically random associations. Isn’t that how 
arguments escalate? Yes? 
 
 
And again, if you want to influence someone, realize that if you accept their 
position as where they are right now, you gain the power to transform that.

So, do you find this useful, guys? Yes. I don't know if – hopefully, interesting 
thoughts are rising, interesting ideas of thinking are going on.  
 
 
As a result, there’s some very simple question that you’re doing, but there’s a 
lot of meat inside of that, right? Go ahead. Over here, and then we’ll come 
forward. 
 
Student: I noticed that too, that – maybe you can handle this as well – people don’t 
have feelings without, and when you normalize them as saying: “Well, you 
know, I’m that way very often” or it’s part of this overall community. You 
make it somehow feel okay. 
 
 Igor: 
Absolutely.  
 
Student: A lot of people share your feelings – 
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions 
2. Non Judgmental 
3. Columbo Approach 
4. Validation 
 
Igor: 
 What you’re doing is, you’re taking the flipside of the non-judgmental 
approach – let’s put it over here, because it fits in – which is validation 
approach. You’re validating them without necessarily cementing them into 
the idea. Right? 
 
 
If someone, for example, says – I’ll give an extreme kind of therapeutic 
example just to make the point, right? Let’s say a client comes in and says: 
“Oh, I get these crazy thoughts of, like, strangling puppies and I want to just 
hurt them, right?”  
 
 
There goes all that: “Oh, you can't do that, just resist that impulse!” Do you 
think that’s going to be very useful? What do you think chances are of me 
actually turning this person to raving psycho serial killer with an idea like that? 
 
 
Instead you can say: “Look, it seems like you’ve got this idea, this drives inside 
of you and you know you’re obviously suffering from that.” What have we just 
done?

I haven’t invalidated the feelings he has; I’ve helped him with the conflict, 
there’s a conflict there, isn’t there? Why would he tell me about those, that 
puppy murdering tendency, unless he was conflicted about it? So, I’m 
leveraging off something that’s already inherent and we’ll get into that when I 
say the idea before.  
 
 
So you’re going to validate them without actually cementing them into what 
they’re saying. You’ve appraised them saying: “Yes, you’re correct.” You’re 
cementing the position. If you’re validating, which is a long lines of: “You 
know I totally get where you’re coming from. Many people come from that 
place” until they discover this one thing and what’s that? 
 
 
Where are you now? Curiosity? Is it a bit of thinking beginning to occur? Is 
there a question that’s arisen in their mind? As soon as that question comes, 
you have the capacity to start doing change. So, thank you, that’s an 
important approach. 
 
Student: One think I was also playing to say also in addition to this. People tend to feel 
safe when they feel like a part of the group, when they’re not singled out. 
 
Igor: 
Well, exactly, because what you’re basically telling them is: “You’re not alone. 
It’s okay, it’s normal to be this way. It’s just, let’s be a little abnormal.” Who 
actually wants to be a normal person? It’s totally standard, mediocre; those 
are other words for normal, aren’t they?   
 
 
It’s weird, we spend so much time just trying to fit in, and when someone 
actually challenges you, do you actually want to be mediocre? You go: “No!” 
and yet, a lot of stuff that we do, and myself included, is done so we fit in. can 
you understand it’s a fundamental paradox in our behavior? Right? 
 
 
We get to exploit that as part of the influencing process if we understand it. 
So that we can allow those parts of behaviors which are useful to remain as 
normal, and those parts of the behavior that are not so useful, as being 
mediocre, which very few people want to be. 
 
Student: What state are you in for all of these keys to come out? 
 
Igor: 
Curious. I’m asking myself questions. That’s the only way I can – like, again, 
we know when we’re talking about hypnosis, the idea of going first. If I want 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
141 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you to follow something, it’s best if I go there first and I kind of model 
subconsciously what to do.  
 
 
If I’m asking myself questions, I am by nature curious. Would that not be fair 
to say? If I am curious, I am modeling to you how you can transform your 
thoughts into thinking. As soon as you’re curious and you’re thinking again, 
you’ve got the power to change every element inside of your mind that you 
have suffered from and continue to suffer from today. 
 
 
So, curious is the best way to describe that. Is that useful, guys? I noticed a 
couple of hands in the air, but we’re running out of time in terms of a break, 
so we have a choice; it’s up to you guys. We can run another five-minutes-
break quickly – how much are we doing on the camera over there? 
 
 
Oh, we’ve got a bit of time. So, we can run a little bit late on the session if you 
want and we just carry on this; we’ll just give it an outer limit, let’s say it’s 10, 
15 minutes; or we can take a break down and come back after the break. 
Which would you prefer? Continue? We’re in a good flow here? Good. I agree 
I just want to give you the choice.  
 
 
So, we have a hand over here and then we’ll come back. Now, as we get – 
again, these questions over here – just stand up for the mike. That’s it. As 
we’re going through this stuff, let me ask you this: are you guys finding this 
useful, is this raising questions inside of your mind in terms of the whole 
influence process? 
 
 
I haven’t given you a formula for this influence, for instance, yet. I’m wanting 
you to have questions about it first, so when I present the actual formula – 
which is indoctrination in its answers – you have grown the capacity to use 
that answer. Does that make sense, everyone? Yes? Please. 
 
Student: You asked us about this, the quality of thoughts that we think the clarity? But 
you didn’t say what’s the value of that? 
  
Igor: 
The value of the clarity? The value of the – let me ask you this: what do you 
think is the purpose of the assessment thought as to how clear and concise it 
is? 
 
Student: My take it is that you’ve sort of completed the thought if they can tell you, 
but concisely.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
142 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. If you are, if you cannot express a thought clearly and concisely, then 
you only have a partial thought. It’s a hazy thought, which means – and this 
happens a lot; we all have this, I am included, by the way, in this – we are 
driven by many half-considered thoughts in our lives. Which one, we actually 
examine them. We realize that we’ve done in our lives anything like that.  
 
 
So the clarity and conciseness tells me how much thinking has occurred to go 
into that thought. By the way, most thoughts are being imposed on you 
without your consent through things like media, political, you know, sound by 
its schools and whatever. Your peer groups included in that as well.  
 
 
Most of those thoughts will be unclear and will be rambling; they will not be 
concise. Precisely, because you never thought about them enough to make 
them clear and concise. Because had you thought about them enough – let 
me just be more precise in terms of current vocabulary – had you been 
thinking about them enough, then they would have become either clear and 
concise or rejected. That’s what happens.  
 
 
Does that answer your question? Go ahead.  
 
Student: I had a question about – you mentioned earlier – about thoughts and 
thinking. I’m curious about – would there be a question that we could ask the 
thoughts – 
 
Igor: 
So, I’ not entirely sure what the question is, but I’ll see if I can paraphrase it 
and you can correct me if I’m incorrect. So, you’re saying – earlier we were 
working with thoughts and thinking – and when a thought arises, you’re 
curious as to how to interact with that thought, can we ask a specific question 
of that thought, to turn it back into thinking or was it something else? 
 
Student: Yes, yes. Like, if it’s a thought, then maybe is it they’re not aware of it – 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Got it. 
 
Student: And may not be resourceful for me. Is there a question that I can just ask that 
out? 
 
Igor: 
Well, let me answer to your question in two ways. Your answer is yes and the 
answer is no. And the reason I say is because you ask is there a question. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
143 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
What am I implying? There are many ways to deal with that and we’ll come 
onto that over the course of today and tomorrow.  
 
 
We’re going to stay specifically with the idea of purpose right now, as you are 
lucid of other things like facts, opinion and other things like that. The answers 
to that question will begin to emerge, okay? You’re welcome. Please, keep it, 
though. Come back to it, by all means.  
 
 
Okay, there was one last question here and that thing – oh, over here, on this 
side of the room. Just stand up so we can actually get a mike to you.  
 
Student: If someone doesn’t think of you as an equal or greater value in their life, can 
you change that thought process to influence that? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. So, ask the question you’ve been meaning to ask.  
 
Student: That was it. 
 
Igor: 
Was it? How? That’s a good question.  
 
Student: Actually, I think that is – I think you can just say yes.  
 
Igor: 
You’re right, and we will address it specifically in some ways. There’s a great 
English TV series, a sitcom from the late 70s and the early 80s, which actually 
demonstrates that exactly in action. In fact, those of you who are on my email 
list would have seen a short clip of one of those episodes.  
 
 
 
Has anyone here heard of a TV show called Yes, Minister or Yes, Prime 
Minister? Put your hands up. If you haven’t, this is a great TV show. 
Essentially, the premise of this thing is you follow the characters of a 
bureaucrat in the English political system.  
 
 
So, he’s an elected official whose job is supposed to be to carry out the, you 
know, the instructions and so on of the minister who is actually being elected 
in the – minister’s equivalent of a, I guess of a congressman or a senator, 
right? 
 
 
So, it’s kind of like the senator’s aid, putting into action the senator’s plans. 
And later on, the senator equivalent becomes a prime minister, which is an 
equivalent of a president, and takes his staff with him.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
144 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
The only thing is the entire premise of the thing is that this aid is manipulating 
the hell out of his minister or his prime minister to get him to change his mind 
about any plan that doesn’t actually conform to what he wants to happen.  
 
 
And with all these kind of clever double-talk, situational thing and so on, he 
basically turns the minister or the prime minister inside out and he gets him 
to agree that his original idea can be modified slightly to be completely, a 180 
degree change, right? 
 
 
It’s a fun show, but there’s a premise. It’s – you know, there are – it’s done 
humorously – the frame setting is done very, you know, very strong to their 
way. But, in terms of what we’re doing here, you’re basically using the 
Columbo approach.  
 
 
The whole point of the Columbo approach – if you think about it – is that you 
can use it in the situation when a person essentially is looking down on you in 
one way or another, whether it’s because they think they’re superior because 
they’re your boss, they’re superior because they know more, they’re more 
educated or whatever it is.  
 
 
Do you want to know who the king of this all was? There was a little man, now 
dead, from Hemlock – anyone know who I’m talking about? Socrates. Yes? 
You know, his biggest research was: “All I know is I now nothing. And, being 
such a stupid fool, maybe you could educate me a little bit in what you seem 
to know so well.”  
 
 
And of course, he was embarrassing them by destroying any semblance of 
certainty they have about whatever they were certain about. So, that’s the 
longer way of answering the question, and the answer is yes. And we’ll be 
addressing tactics along that line as we continue.  
 
 
But the essence lies there at the idea of Columbo approach. Okay. Does that 
help? All right. Are we ready for a break? I think we’re about, do you? So, it’s 
now 10:45, let’s call it 10:45. Let’s be back here at five to 11 and we’ll start at 
11 on the dot.  
 
 
Okay, guys? Off you go.

DVD 5 – Influence Questions, Uncovering 
Motives & Assessing The Unconscious Mind 
 
 
Asking Questions Of Influence 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back how was your break? Who’s finding themselves asking a lot 
more questions during their breaks? I have a long list of not necessarily actual 
questions but purposes for your questions that are going to help you 
incredibly with Mind Bending Language. 
 
 
Are you already noticing that just this one level of questioning – motivation 
and purpose – already gives you huge amounts of leverage, a huge amount of 
approaches for using Mind Bending Language influentially? Would that be fair 
to say? 
 
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
 
 
I’ll just throw this out there quickly now and we may address it in more detail 
as we go along. There’s a principle in whatever industry or field that you 
operate in. If you’re a teacher or you’re a salesperson selling a particular kind 
of item to a particular kind of customers and so on, you’ll notice that people 
tend to fall into predictable categories of thoughts or thought patterns. 
 
 
The same kind of thoughts will emerge over and over again amongst a certain 
group of people in a certain kind of context. As it’s true overall that people 
across the world are very different and think differently and so on, it is equally 
true that 90% of the people you’ll interact with in a context where you wish to 
be influential will have similar patterns of thought, if there’s any thinking 
going on at all.  
 
 
Why do you think it might be important to realize that in any situation where 
you want to influence others that 90% of their thoughts will be predictable? 
What do  you think might be useful about that?

Student: You redesign your language patterns to suit how they’d think. 
 
Igor: 
So, you’d redesign your language pattern to suit how they think so that you’re 
in rapport with them and so on. I’d go one step further than that. Would you 
limit it just to language? Body language? What else?  
 
 
Let’s put it this way. Let’s go back to our fundamental premise. What is the 
purpose of language? It’s communication of a thought, an idea or to promote 
thinking, isn’t it? 
 
 
Really what’s you understand what thoughts are inside someone already 
preexisting, it tells you how to be influential because you know what thoughts 
you need to start crafting, what thoughts you have to change into thinking, 
and what steps you have to take that thinking through so they can change 
direction towards more useful thoughts. 
 
 
It’s kind of like in here. I know that in a learning environment like this most 
people will have some kind of learning anxiety. It’s guaranteed it’s going to 
happen. Some people will just jump in the deep end and laugh like a school 
girl and enjoy it. Most people at some point will come up against a wall where 
there will be an emotional block to the learning process. 
 
 
Knowing that, I can transform that. I can set frames at the beginning that will 
help me use them later. I can provide information in different ways. I can 
challenge you in a way that actually will create a paradox in terms of creating 
that problem so that it’s very unlikely to arise.  
 
 
You have to be very, very good at a learning phobia in order for you to 
experience it in one of my sessions. Some people are but even then once they 
get a one-on-one, it’s even easier.  
 
 
Do you understand the nature of what we’re doing here? We are investigating 
thoughts and thinking so that once we understand a particular niche or 
environment well enough, we can then do shortcuts. 
 
 
Just a quick question or just a quick comment someone makes will tell you oh 
I get it, he’s that kind of person and now I know how to influence them. That’s 
what experience gives you.

People say how do I influence people or how do I make a sale? I have to say 
how on Earth would I know how you’ll make a sale? I don’t know what you 
sell, who you sell it to, what they think, what they want or what they need. 
How am I supposed to know? 
 
 
But once you’re in front of those people and you’ve been in front of enough 
people asking questions like these, then you’ll have the raw materials to be 
able to predict and to run shortcuts and so on. Does that make sense to 
everyone? 
 
 
In the earlier session, we explored one kind of question, which is the idea of 
motivation and purpose. We assessed it in terms of clarity and conciseness 
because a clear and concise thought is one that the person actually took the 
trouble to think through fully. 
 
 
 
Accessing Thoughts/Thinking: 
1. Clarity and Conciseness 
 
 
Any thought that is unclear or imprecise or not concise sort of rambling hasn’t 
fully been contemplated. It hasn’t fully been thought through and hence you 
know where there could be some leverage with that person. 
 
 
Do you think that just asking questions about people’s motivation is the end 
all and be all of influence? Is that the only kind of question that’s worth asking 
if you understand someone’s motivation, if you understand all of their 
thinking, their thoughts, their behaviors, their emotions? No. 
 
 
There are other kinds of questions you can ask too. Would that be fair to say? 
So, I’d like to address another one of those questions. Can I have a volunteer 
please? This is going to be easy.  
 
Demo: Probing Questions 
 
Igor: 
I’ll go with Amir for this one because knowing his mind this will be the easiest 
one. Come forward. Give him a round of applause. I’m very glad you put your 
hand up because you’re perfect for this one. So, you’re here to learn Mind 
Bending Language, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
148 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
And you’ve explored some of the motivations and so on, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Just give me a quick toke of it, just so I get a sense of what you’ve been 
uncovering. 
 
Amir: 
For myself? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Amir: 
I’ve been uncovering how to access the state, the motivation to learning, so it 
makes it flow a lot easier. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, great. What is it that intrigues you about Mind Bending Language? You 
obviously are interested in it, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What intrigues you about it? 
 
Amir: 
Just understanding how information gets put in and comes back out so that 
way you can communicate with anyone. 
 
Igor: 
What is it you know already about communicating with anyone? I mean not 
just in Mind Bending Language, but just in general. What is it you know about 
how to communicate with people? 
 
Amir: 
You’ve just got to pay attention to them and understand where they’re 
coming from. Just be there with them. 
 
Igor: 
What does paying attention mean? How do you do that? 
 
Amir: 
Well, you’re calibrating to a lot of things. So, you’re calibrating to how they’re 
seeing and perceiving the world. You’re calibrating to their reactions. 
 
Igor: 
How would you actually do that? If you’re calibrating someone, what are you 
doing to know what they’re perceiving and reacting to?

Amir: 
I’m looking specifically at their face, the pauses that they make, where their 
eyes go, how they say specific things, their tonality. 
 
Igor: 
What do those things mean? Give me some examples. 
 
Amir: 
Well, it depends on the context. If the person is saying I really like exploring 
new ideas, if they say exploring new ideas you know that they made an 
emphasis on exploring and, therefore, it’s important to them and 
understanding how they perceive that, you can use that. 
 
Igor: 
That’s an interesting thing you just said there. When someone emphasizes a 
word or something like that, then you know that there is something of 
importance there. 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And you mentioned that by knowing that, then you can kind of use that in 
some purposeful way, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, how do you know what to make of that? If someone uses the word 
exploring and they’ve said it in that way, what do you do with it? 
 
Amir: 
Well, it’s obviously a state-captured and the word exploring, you can use that 
towards where you want them to be thinking or where you want them to be.  
 
 
So, let’s say they say I want to learn this but I’m not able to do it, then you say 
well you like exploring new ideas, and why don’t you pay attention to a new 
way that you could be exploring a new idea on how to learn? So, you kind of 
use that state to overcome the problem. 
 
Igor: 
And what’s this all got to do with Mind Bending Language? 
 
Amir: 
Well, Mind Bending Language is another way, a different way or just more 
information on how to perceive the unconscious response and thinking so 
that way you can have a new way of delivering information to influence them 
in a positive way. 
 
Igor: 
Give me an example of what you mean by that.

Amir: 
Specifically with Mind Bending Language? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Amir: 
If you’re talking to a person and they say I just can’t see through it and I say 
what if you just look above it or over it or behind that, what do you think is 
there? Using those words and Mind Bending Language, that perspective can 
help resolve that issue. It’s as simple as knowing the right words to say. 
 
Igor: 
How many different places would you use Mind Bending Language? 
 
Amir: 
Everywhere. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a big thing, isn’t it? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. So, at work when I’m coaching clients and when I’m training, it’s just 
when you’re communicating with people because their words are 
unconsciously-consciously selected. 
 
Igor: 
Can you give me an unusual example of where you’ve used it that wouldn’t 
necessarily be obvious? 
 
Amir: 
An unusual example? 
 
Igor: 
Are you beginning to see what we’re doing? Do you have a sense of where 
we’re going with this? Who thinks they’ve spotted the pattern of the 
questions yet?  
 
Student: What are you doing? How are you doing it? Can you give me examples?  
 
Igor: 
So, those are the nature of the actual questions. What kind of information am 
I looking for with those questions? You’re correct, absolutely. Those are the 
actual questions I’m asking but if you recall earlier on we were talking about 
motivation and purpose. What am I looking at now? 
 
Student: You’re looking for an opinion. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, there was some emphasis there. It must be important.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
151 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Opinion is very important. 
 
Igor: 
We are looking for opinions. That’s kind of part of it but it’s not quite what 
we’re looking for specifically. Do you want me to continue or do you have 
some other things you want to say? Is this useful? Are you finding this 
interesting? Go ahead. 
 
Student: Beliefs – if you do this, then it means that. 
 
Igor: 
Actually beliefs are coming out of this. Beliefs are important. I’m not 
specifically going after beliefs right now. I’m going after a slightly different 
quality of information, but you guys are doing well. I actually like this. You’re 
pre-teaching a lot of other stuff we’re coming onto. Go ahead. 
 
Student: Get the goals, why he wants to do it and he’s using it for. 
 
Igor: 
The second one is more. I asked why he wants to do it just because I needed 
to get a sense of what you’ve already done. Leverage is always useful. What 
he wants to do it for is getting much closer to what I’m thinking about right 
now. We’ll take two more guesses and then I’ll continue a little bit further. 
 
Student: I think you’re looking for his models. 
 
Igor: 
His models of what? 
 
Student: Models appearing – how does he do that? 
 
Igor: 
What I’m really looking at is the context he places this information in because 
context colors everything. It’s the frames of reference, isn’t it? Here’s a classic 
example. I think one of the home-study courses has this one. 
 
 
Imagine the following scenario. You’re sitting at the traffic light and it’s red so 
you can’t go anywhere. It would be very silly to sit at a traffic light when it’s 
green. You’re in your car and as you’re holding at the red light, you hear the 
sound of a siren.  
 
 
You look in your rearview mirror and there’s an ambulance. It speeds past you 
and goes through the red light and carries on its way. How do you feel about 
that event? Good, bad or indifferent? Indifferent, but it’s like oh it’s 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
152 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
something important happening. You don’t really care that an ambulance 
basically shot through a red light, which you had to stop for. 
 
 
Now let’s assume just for the sake of contrast that behind the ambulance 
there’s a guy driving in his red Ferrari. He’s got the gold chain on and there’s 
loud music blaring. He’s got the stereotype trophy wife sitting next to him and 
he tears right past you in the wake of the ambulance and goes through that 
same red light.  
 
 
How do you feel about that event? The same, indifferent or do you feel just a 
tiny amount of animosity? If you think about it it’s the exact same sequence 
of events, isn’t it? It’s a vehicle overtaking you through a red light and passing 
it, but you have a different context, a different frame of reference for the 
experience so that one is acceptable and one is not. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
Let’s test this now by changing the frame of reference a little bit. As the 
ambulance passes by you, the back door swings open and you see a bunch of 
students in there having a party. They’ve clearly just stolen the ambulance 
and are having the time of their lives. Does that change your opinion of the 
event? 
 
 
What if I told you that the Ferrari driver is with his wife who he cares for very 
deeply? She’s pregnant. She slipped and taken a fall. The baby is coming and 
he’s trying to get her to the hospital to save the baby. Have you changed your 
mind about that now? 
 
 
That’s the power of framing. The context or the frame of reference that you 
use for any idea or information will color that idea or information. I don’t 
know how to influence Amir until I know what frames of reference he has. If I 
want to teach Amir Mind Bending Language better, I need to know what 
context he places it in. So, what does Mind Bending Language mean to you? 
 
Amir: 
A different way of communicating for influence. 
 
Igor: 
Why do you need a different way? I mean you like the idea of Mind Bending 
Language. So, what is it about Mind Bending Language that is important to 
you? This is going to motivation a little bit. What is it about Mind Bending 
Language that separates that from other ways of communicating with 
people?

Amir: 
I feel like there’s a new layer to communication that I wasn’t paying attention 
to before, and with that it feels like I have all the tools I need to effectively 
influence a person. 
 
Igor: 
What do you mean by a new layer? Do you see where we’re going now? Let 
me just pause you again. Do you notice what’s happening? Do you see how 
he’s now he’s being forced to think?  
 
 
Initially the questions – yes, I didn’t have complete hits on them. I got a sense 
of the general worldview or perception that he has about Mind Bending 
Language. It fits in the idea of influential communication.  
 
 
Once we establish that as a context, I’m starting to hone down a little bit. Are 
you noticing that? What am I honing down to? It’s the specific framework. To 
get the context, I’m asking general questions like how does Mind Bending 
Language fit into your general world? Oh, it’s part of communication. How is it 
part of communication? Well, you can do these things and these things. 
 
 
In other words, I’m asking what does Mind Bending Language include in it as 
far as context, experiences go? Once I have established that – and that’s 
something that should be relatively easy for him to do most of the time – I go 
to something a little trickier, which is what are the frames? How do you 
perceive Mind Bending Language? 
 
 
To do that, I’m going to contrast it – how is that different from all the other 
things that fit into the same category? Do you see where I’m going with the 
questions here? There are many ways to ask that question but I’m looking at 
the essence of what distinctions his mind is making.  
 
 
What does he include along with Mind Bending Language, and how does he 
exclude Mind Bending Language from all the other things he includes it with? 
Because otherwise they would all be Mind Bending Language, wouldn’t they?  
 
 
Is this a chair that I’m sitting on right now? Yes or no? Is this a barstool that 
I’m sitting on right now? Yes or no? So, how is a barstool different from a 
chair? 
 
Student: It’s a classification. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
154 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
It’s a classification, yes. Spoken like a true biologist. I don’t know if you are 
one but it’s funny. So, this object that I’m sitting on right now has multiple 
points of view for you, or you perceive it in many different ways. You have 
many reference points for it, many different contexts for it. 
 
 
In a bar fight it might be a weapon. In a bar where there’s an attractive 
member of whatever sex you find attractive sitting next to an open space, it 
may be an opportunity. You’re welcome. In an art class it may be an object of 
interest or it may be an object of study. In a philosophy class it may be 
something to think about.  
 
 
So, when you think about chairs there’s a context. The larger context will be 
things like furniture, household items, weapons and that sort of stuff. Then 
the other context is what is it that makes this unique? What makes it non-
unique? What is it part of the group? What is it that separates it from that 
group?  
 
 
In doing so, I’m beginning to understand what reference points Amir is using 
to understand or make sense of this. Knowing that Amir lumps Mind Bending 
Language primarily into communication gives me a different scope of things 
to do with it than if he lumps it directly into therapy.  
 
 
If he puts it just into therapy, I may need to expand his category before going 
back to the idea of therapy so that he can be a better therapist. He’s given me 
quite a wide category, which is very Amir, so now to make it meaningful I’ve 
got to look at what is the exception? How is it special? So, how is it special? 
 
Amir: 
It’s another layer. 
 
Igor: 
Right, and now you can see the unconscious thing there. So, what is in that 
layer? What is that about? You’re seeing the unconscious moment, right? And 
that was it. I’m sorry to have talked over it. Did you hear what he just said? 
Would you repeat that last phrase? What’s that layer about? It’s difficult to 
put into words, right? 
 
Amir: 
It’s difficult to put into words. I see it. It’s kind of like if there’s a sentence 
that… 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you here a second? Thank you for doing that, by the way. We 
just reached an unconscious moment. Did you clearly hear a distinction 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
155 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
between when he was talking about the context – which was relatively 
obvious to him – and now we went down to the actual specific frame, and 
that’s when more unconscious material starts coming out. 
 
 
Did you hear it and see it? It’s very obvious once you look for it, right? Now 
let’s compare this to what happened to you yesterday. Remember a number 
of you were saying there’s stuff spinning around, I feel my mind doing 
something but I don’t know what it is. 
 
 
That was content-free, so of course the unconscious moment makes no sense 
to you because it’s content-free. You have no frame of reference to refer it 
back to. Some of you – and you actually were one of them which is why I 
knew this would be useful for you – started saying things like it’s big, I don’t 
know what it is but it’s big, something’s there, I can feel something beginning 
to happen. 
 
 
That is basically the fruitful territory that we’re looking for. That’s basically the 
unconscious mind beginning to turn that thinking into a thought of value. 
Now I could spend a long time just on that thought alone, or that thinking 
process. So, there’s this layer and you can all see it. You can probably feel it 
but it’s difficult to describe. Is that right?  
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. 
 
Amir: 
The best way I can describe it is that there’s like a sentence and then 
underneath each word there’s like a color that is associated with it, and then 
that one four-letter word can spread out to this big color of understanding, 
and from that you know what you need to do – if you need to swap the color 
or flip it or switch it around. That’s how I understand it. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that wonderful description, by the way. Would you like to just 
see where Mind Bending Language fits into all this? Seeing as that’s the best 
way for you to describe it – and actually it’s a very useful way and I can see 
the metaphor – what’s another way? Thank you.  
 
 
Did you hear the Mind Bending Language? Was it crazy spins? Did I have the 
effect of a crazy intense spin? Is your mind spinning right now?

Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is it reeling? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Are you – I think it was Collin’s words – feeling like you’ve been mentally 
tasered? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Am I about to get an even better quality of information if I persist in this line 
of questioning? Your best way of describing it is actually very eloquent, which 
is this idea of you have a word and underneath it is this big pool of color that 
kind of comes out in that word, and there are a lot of things you can do with 
that word that gives you access to all those things and it shapes those things 
and all kinds of interesting things are going on there. 
 
 
That’s really as far as you told me. If I misunderstood you, I apologize. That’s 
the best way you can describe that. 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, just to change it a little bit and mix it up a bit, what’s a better way to 
describe it? Am I taking him down the same path only more, or down a 
different path? It’s now a mildly different path but it’s going to be similar. Do 
you feel it? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Let me now give you a harder contrast. So, there’s a word, there are the 
colors and this is an important thing to you, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And that really is the best way you currently know how to describe it, right? 
 
Amir: 
Right. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
157 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
So, what’s another way of describing it? That’s a harder contrast. Do you see 
it? Why? Think about it this way – and this is using his metaphor. Best has a 
certain set of associations. What’s closer to best – better or other? 
 
Amir: 
Better. 
 
Igor: 
So, whilst better may seem very different, it’s not. Are you beginning to get a 
sense of this? So, when I ask him other, I’m asking for a deeper search. More 
thinking is going on and it’s much more furious and it’s a harder transition for 
him. 
 
 
If I merely ask for a better description, I may get a better answer by asking for 
an other answer than the better one. Just consider that for a while because 
now they’re all mixed up, aren’t they? 
 
Amir: 
Yes, I mean they’re all better or best. I mean I guess, I don’t know. What I’m 
seeing is when you said a better way, what happens to the words across kind 
of went vertical and I was like maybe could this be better? I’m not sure but I 
started comparing it between the two. When you said other, it just kind of 
exploded the picture and then it was it recreates something. 
 
Igor: 
Just think about that for a while. No, really think about it. I don’t need an 
answer by the way right now. I just need you to really think about this 
because there’s obviously something very important going on in that thought 
process. 
 
 
So, there’s really no point in you rushing this. Just really think about that 
because I have a sense that something important is happening as you do that. 
So, what’s happening now? What kind of thinking are you doing? 
 
Amir: 
I’m sorting through, I guess, other pictures and for a second I saw… 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you once again. Did you see that you actually could see 
before he said that, that he was doing that? Could you see like little mini 
thoughts occurring? Whether there were pictures or not I didn’t know. The 
point is you can see little this is one, this is two, this is three and there’s some 
kind of evaluation process going on. 
 
 
Can you see that in his mannerisms, especially his facial expression, please 
continue with this… pictures you were sorting through? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
158 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Amir: 
Yes, there are pictures I’m sorting through but none of them feel right. 
 
Igor: 
So, they’re different but they’re not better? 
 
Amir: 
They’re different but I feel like the first way, well let me see… 
 
Igor: 
Is he doing some thinking now? Is he putting some effort into this now? Do 
you think at the end of this process he’s more likely or less likely to be in a 
position to use Mind Bending Language in a more proficient way than before 
we had this conversation? 
 
 
I haven’t even done any influencing yet, have I? Am I going after clarity and 
conciseness right now? He’s not very clear about his answer. He knows 
there’s something there but there’s not much clarity there. But by forcing him 
to think to get towards that clarity, whether or not he actually finds an actual 
thought that he can come down on… Thank you. That was fast. 
 
Amir: 
Yes, it happens when you’re taking. What I’m seeing now is here’s a better 
way, so I guess this is the best way now. 
 
Igor: 
By the way, did you hear that? Please hold onto that thought as I talk 
elsewhere. Did you see what his mind does so quickly? He’s combined all the 
concepts I’ve suggested together. He’s found a better way, another way and 
it’s become the best way, a new best way. 
 
 
I have already influenced him just by the nature of the questions I’ve asked, 
and they haven’t had any crazy spins. It’s just I’m using much better material 
now. The more material I have from him, especially when we get to the 
unconscious stuff, the less work I have to do.  
 
Amir: 
So, seeing what the words do in terms of space, like let’s say the word 
beyond, and seeing people like shoot through time and space, and then like 
inside, like literally going inside it and perceiving it that way, the sudden shifts 
make it a lot easier for me to see exactly what they’re saying, so I can visualize 
the words a lot clearer. 
 
Igor: 
And how does all this relate to the idea of communication and influencing 
people?

Amir: 
When you’re communicating with them, they’re literally telling you how their 
mind is seeing everything and hearing and feeling and to go through that kind 
of roller coaster with them will make it so much easier to understand where 
they’re at and what to say and how to guide their thought processes. 
 
Igor: 
Give me an example, just a brief one. 
 
Amir: 
If they say they can’t see it, maybe they can feel it as opposed to that, so 
maybe understanding that if they’re not seeing it in front of them, that feeling 
it would be an easier thing for them to do as opposed to trying to force them 
to see it.  
 
Igor: 
Sure and how does that relate to Mind Bending Language? Can you see some 
thinking going on here? I like the answer I’m hearing, by the way. I’m of 
course testing for clarity and conciseness. There are some other things we’ll 
come onto in a minute as well. 
 
 
Let me ask you this. This is a little timeout here. We’ve had a relatively brief 
conversation about Mind Bending Language. Do you feel like you’ve learned 
something so far? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I mean you learned something important. 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What is that? How can he have a thought yet when he’s still thinking about it, 
right? It’s getting there. 
 
Amir: 
I don’t know. I just can’t put it into words.  
 
Igor: 
I know. Not yet anyway, but this will help you be a better communicator, be 
more influential and so on, is that correct? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
How do you know that? 
 
Amir: 
Because I can see myself communicating without effort.

Igor: 
Okay, so we have a new concept that’s just come in, haven’t we? It’s easier, 
right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, you feel you’ve learned and grown as a result of that? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did I teach him anything? Did I use any kind of indoctrination process? Did I 
actually provide him with any new information? I did not provide him with 
any new information whatsoever, so there’s absolutely no indoctrination 
occurring whatsoever in that little interaction. 
 
 
Yet he’s learned something but I haven’t provided any of that. That is what 
education is about, isn’t it? Now notice I have no problem with indoctrination. 
It has a useful role to play. Right now I’m indoctrinating you because I’m 
presenting you with my thoughts as a result of 15 years of experience doing 
this stuff. 
 
 
However, the place he’s at, the reason it feels easier to use Mind Bending 
Language is because he’s gone beyond the indoctrination. He’s taken those 
elements that he can think about in an educational sense and he’s learned 
something as a result, and that’s all him. My job was only to facilitate the 
thinking process. Were you glad of that? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you understand where we’re going with this? Let me just write this down 
quickly.  
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context/Frames & Point Of View 
 
 
We have the context, frames and we’ll call it the point of view that they bring 
to whatever that subject at hand is – in this case it’s Mind Bending Language.

As you reflect back on the little discussion that we just had here, can you all 
see the questions I was asking him – and that’s why I was saying to you guys 
the how’s and the what’s and the why’s – they were the right questions but 
really the function of those questions, the way that hose pipe was pointing 
was to get a sense of the context. Where does Mind Bending Language fit in 
terms of your knowledge base? Not in your information base but in your 
knowledge base. 
 
 
If I get things back from him that just seems like information like data points, 
what can I predict about that? I can conclude one of two things. Either he’s 
only given me glib answers, so I’ve got to dig some more; or more likely he 
hasn’t got any clue of what to do with this. 
 
 
He has academic knowledge, which I would call information. He knows about 
it but he can do nothing with it. So, my job will then be to connect the 
academic information into an experiential know-how.  
 
 
Now as we were talking of course he was giving me many experiential 
reference points, contexts. What does that tell me? He’s done this before. He 
can actually do Mind Bending Language, and I know that because I know a 
little bit about Amir already, which is another reason why this was a more 
useful demo.  
 
 
Knowing that he’s already done it and he’s done it competently, I know that a 
different quality of information is going to come out, because he has 
knowledge and experience of that knowledge, which means I can then get 
him to reconnect with that knowledge plus all the more abstract information 
he has and never really put into practice, and help him to create a bigger 
know-how, a bigger knowledge set so that now he can go forward with 
greater confidence to be more influential. Does that kind of describe how the 
process feels? 
 
Amir: 
Right on focus. 
 
Igor: 
How did I know that? Experience and he’s told me that indirectly in terms of 
the nature of his answers. So, do you understand how important context, 
their frames and their point of view in a situation are? Do you have any 
questions or comments about that? 
 
Amir: 
No. Well, just one comment. I don’t know if it’s useful.

Igor: 
You’re sublime. You’re so great, Igor. You’re fantastic! Yes, I agree. Thank you. 
That was educational of course. No indoctrination there.  
 
Amir: 
Well, when I was thinking about it, when you had me thinking about the 
perspectives I had on Mind Bending Language, it seems like I didn’t realize 
that until now that I’ve actually taken those different perspectives before, so 
it’s kind of like I flip and flop between them, so I was always already doing 
that in a sense, and it just feels like I have more choices. 
 
Igor: 
What has he just described? He’s now more clear and more concise because 
before he may have been doing it sometimes, but because there was no 
conscious involved in it, he had no choice about how much easier it will be. If I 
can just paraphrase what you said, let me make a prediction. 
 
 
That means that at times it felt very easy to use Mind Bending Language to 
you and you just got the results and they were satisfying, and other times you 
had no clue what went wrong because you said the right words; they just 
didn’t have the magic. 
 
 
If you look back on those situations where it was clunky and didn’t work out 
and you had no clue what it was, looking back did you have a little I get it 
moment? 
 
Amir: 
Yes, totally. 
 
Igor: 
So, if you had to rerun that same conversation again with Mind Bending 
Language, you may even use the same words but you’d do it totally 
differently. 
 
Amir: 
Yes, a lot more elegantly, smoother, easier. It will reach a point where – it’s 
almost there where it’s completely just unconscious. It’s just part of my 
communication. I don’t think I have to do – oh I’m doing Mind Bending 
Language. I’m just speaking it in the right way. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. Do you understand how that process has gone on? Are there any 
questions? Let me just release him back to the wild. Give him a nice round of 
applause. Thank you very much, Amir. I appreciate that. 
 
 
Was this useful?

Assessing Information 
 
Igor: 
The next thing I want to add here is another measure of assessing in terms of 
how happy you are with the information you’re getting from the other 
person.  
 
 
Clearly the idea of clarity and conciseness has given us something valuable, 
right? It tells us how much thinking is going on, how fixed those thoughts are, 
and if they’re unclear or rambling, that gives you a great opportunity to break 
that thought up into a new thinking process because it’s already unstable, 
shall we say. 
 
 
If he has a lot of clarity about a thought but there’s just repetition. In other 
words he can’t come at it from different directions that tells you that there’s a 
stronger form of indoctrination going on. In other words, he’s being 
conditioned to hang onto this idea without fully understanding what he’s 
hanging onto. Do you see where I’m going with this?  
 
 
 
Assessing Thoughts/Thinking: 
1. Clarity and Conciseness 
2. Relevant, Important/Significant 
 
 
What do you think that standard is about? What does that do for us? What 
are you looking for when you’re checking whether what they’re talking about 
is relevant, important or significant? We’re looking for some criteria? What is 
the purpose of this? 
 
 
Let’s just step back. What are we using Mind Bending Language for? 
Influence, right? What is influence? Is it just random change? I come and kick 
you in the shins, you have a bruise, you’ve changed and I probably influenced 
you.  
 
 
Do I now have the right to say I’m influential because I can go around kicking 
people’s shins and causing a bruise? I’m now going to have a new hypnotic 
product. The world’s greatest influence is real easy. It only works if you have 
legs. Have I missed something? The sense of improvement?  
 
Student: I think what she did was solve a problem.

Igor: 
Exactly. We have a purpose in mind, don’t we? There’s a purpose. What is the 
point of trying to influence someone unless you already know what you’re 
trying to influence them for? If you ask someone do you want to go to the 
cinema with me or the movies, there is a specific purpose and place. You have 
a goal already. 
 
 
That’s what the relevant, important or significant thing tells you. Is what 
they’re talking about right now relevant in relation to what my purpose is? 
With Amir, I had two simultaneous purposes.  
 
 
The overt purpose – the one we talked about here – is to find out what 
context or frames of reference or points of view he has around the idea of 
Mind Bending Language. 
 
 
The second goal – which was kind of disclosed to give the whole interaction a 
purpose – is for me to help him improve his Mind Bending Language, which 
happened.  
 
 
If I was an evil hypnotist, my purpose might have been to make him a worse 
mind bending hypnotist. I’d have no competition. Would I have served that 
purpose in terms of the discussion we just had? No, thankfully. 
 
 
Relevant, important and significant tells you whether the information you’re 
getting is of any value to you as the questioner, as the influencer, as the 
hypnotist or not. 
 
 
If he starts scrambling off about other things, we can pause them and say 
that’s very interesting but what I’m more interested about is getting back on 
track. If he talks about something that is just minor, it is relevant.  
 
 
For example, this is about communication for him, so if he starts talking about 
his ability to speak the English language, it is relevant but it’s not particularly 
significant because he’s clearly fluent in it.  
 
 
So, there’s initially no purpose in pursuing that train of thought unless later on 
it comes up and becomes more significant for other reasons. For example, if 
he mentions that he’s not very confident in using the English language. Now it 
suddenly becomes relevant and significant or important. Do you see where 
I’m going with this?

We have now two standards to which you can hold their thoughts, and those 
standards will inform what questions you ask to follow up on. Do you 
understand those two standards? Do you understand the two types of 
questions or the two styles of probing questions that you can engage in? 
 
 
So, we’re going to do the same exercise as before with three different people. 
In fact let’s get into groups of three in a minute – A, B and C. A will ask 
questions, B will just be answering, C will just see the relationship between 
the two of them. 
 
 
Ask them to remind you, because you haven’t actually spoken to them before, 
about their motivation and purpose in terms of learning Mind Bending 
Language just to get a ballpark. That will already give you some information 
that will help you establish a context and a frame of reference because 
they’re interrelated, aren’t they? 
 
 
If he tells me he wants to become a better communicator, that’s motivational 
for him but it also tells me the context in which he’s placed Mind Bending 
Language. If he tells me he wants to be a better healer, that’s a different 
context. 
 
 
When Linda was up here, communication was probably a minor aspect of it. It 
was more about spiritual transformation. That’s the context in which it fits. 
It’s more of a healing, therapeutic context, and then the idea of 
communication in general is more of a minor thing. 
 
 
So, I could expand her perception of communication as being the tool for 
therapy, healing and so on, at which point a richer world comes open to her 
because experiences that are currently locked into the idea of communication 
become available when engaging in doing therapy or healing work, which 
otherwise would have just been ignored. 
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? Is this useful stuff? Get the motivation 
and purpose upfront. Just get them to tell you what they discovered in the 
last session just so you have a reference point for that.  
 
 
Use that as your launch pad for the context, the frames of reference and the 
points of view that this individual holds in relation to Mind Bending Language.

Whilst you’re doing this, you’re asking yourself how clear and concise are 
they? If they’re not very clear and concise, you can question that and ask 
yourself how important or relevant the information is.  
 
 
If the information is irrelevant or insignificant, then you can redirect your 
questioning back to something more relevant and more significant. Do you 
understand the nature of the exercise? There’s a quick question over here. 
 
Student: I understand it but it still seems a little bit too conceptual for me. It would 
really help if you could throw out two or three questions. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. I understand. So, right now you’re about to do an exercise, right? Do you 
want to do well on the exercise? Why? 
 
Student: Because I want to learn as much as I can about Mind Bending Language. 
 
Igor: 
So, what does Mind Bending Language mean to you? 
 
Student: It means a form of being able to do conversational hypnosis in a super 
proficient way. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, good. So, I have my first context, don’t I? Conversational hypnosis, 
right? It’s important for you to become more efficient at the idea of 
conversational hypnosis, right? So, what’s important to you about 
conversational hypnosis?  
 
 
Notice I’m starting with my motivation again. It gives me leverage and what’s 
going to come out is going to give me more of a context to be worth 
questioning. So, conversational hypnosis is obviously important to you. Why? 
 
Student: Because I have a bigger goal, that is for educating therapists. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so you’re interested in Mind Bending Language to become a better 
conversational hypnotist, and your interest in conversational hypnosis is 
primarily as a trainer to help others to master conversational hypnosis and do 
stuff with it. Why do you want to teach them conversational hypnosis? 
 
Student: I want to improve the education system.

Igor: 
Thank you, now we have the context. Did you hear it? It’s the same 
information but there are multiple layers within the same information. There 
are different things that the same piece of information does. In this case the 
idea of improving the educational system is motivational to you. 
 
 
Now I can explore that idea on its own. What is it about improving education 
that’s important to you? How is that going to improve your life and what is it 
that this does for you?  
 
 
It might be about a mission or a legacy or about spreading healing in the 
world or there’s less suffering or having less ills befalling mankind. It may even 
be tied into your mission as a Rabi. Who knows? But that would be going 
down the motivation and purpose route. It’s fruitful absolutely. However, it’s 
going to give me only tangential elements of frames of reference and context. 
 
 
Instead, knowing that the educational thing is of importance to you, now I’m 
going to open that as a context. How does Mind Bending Language relate to 
education? It’s a question. 
 
Student: It relates that teachers can communicate; well they could first give knowledge 
to students more than indoctrination. Even when indoctrinating they could do 
it in a way that’s much more powerful and meaningful. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, do you see there’s a healing metaphor coming in here? There’s 
a healing frame of reference. We’re in the context of education. So, of course 
there’s the motivation effort, everything is interlinked in your mind anyways, 
right? I’m more interested right now in the context and the frames of 
reference.  
 
 
Let me give you a contrast frame on this one. What do you think is going 
wrong right now with education? I’ll get back on my soapbox only he’s going 
to do my talking. 
 
Student: People aren’t thinking anymore. 
 
Igor: 
People aren’t thinking anymore, right? So, if I understand you correctly – and 
please correct me if I misunderstand this – are you suggesting that Mind 
Bending Language is a useful tool to improve the quality of people’s thinking? 
 
Student: In a context yes it’s an unbelievable tool. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
168 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. What’s the context? 
 
Student: The context is in getting people to believe in themselves and know that they 
can… 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I now have a bigger context again. Do you see that? We’ve gone 
beyond education now. We’ve come into some kind of self-fulfillment 
context, and educational is a sub-context within the general idea of self-
fulfillment. I’ll just use those words just for brevity’s sake. 
 
 
So, now I have a much clearer idea of his context, don’t I? I also have a much 
clearer idea of your motivation. Just because I’m going after context and 
frames of references and so on does not mean that I’m not actually getting 
motivation and purpose as well, and that’s the value of this. 
 
 
I can explore your motivation and purpose, and I’ll discover more about your 
context. I can question you about the context and discover things about the 
motivation that you forgot to tell me or you weren’t consciously aware of. 
 
 
So, by increasing the types of probing questions that we have access to, I 
increase the chances of me even reaching unconscious moments and genuine 
unconscious material so that I understand how you think and understand your 
thoughts better, which allows me to influence him further and so on.  
 
 
Does that give you a better context for context? Thank you for that. Was that 
useful to you guys? Give him a round of applause for that.  
 
 
I’m limiting myself specifically to just context for the moment because there’s 
other stuff we can do as well and everything is interrelated, which means 
asking about one type of thing will give you information about another type of 
thing, and as you understand what you’re looking for, you become yourself 
very concise. 
 
 
A few questions will give you a lot of information that they don’t know they 
gave you, but right now we’re getting back to the mechanical stage of 
specifically seeking after a certain type of information or knowledge so that 
when we put it together later, you recognize all the constituent elements. 
That makes sense, doesn’t it? So, do you all understand the exercise now? 
Three people – A, B, and C.

Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How did that go? Did you have fun with that? Did you notice 
that even though you’re asking about context, you’re actually getting more 
insight into the motivation that you wouldn’t otherwise get as well?  
 
 
So, every question you ask has multiple layers in terms of the quality of the 
answer you get back, but we’re focusing specifically on certain types of 
questions or information just to accustom you to different things that you’ll 
be looking for. 
 
 
I could just give you a whole list of stuff and it would be essentially 
meaningless. You’d say yes that’s good, how do you do that, how do you do 
what you do? It’s by paying attention to the small distinctions between 
questions that ask about their motivation and purpose, questions that ask 
about their context, frames and points of view, and other questions we’ll be 
coming onto. 
 
 
Over to you guys. What kinds of things did you notice or learn from that 
exercise compared to the first one in particular? A thundering silence – that’s 
interesting. Okay, now the hands come up. 
 
Student: Personally, what I learned from the previous discussion and this discussion is 
that you become more focused and you have constantly sort of the pathway 
of motivation and context. So you are able to ask many more questions than 
we could before.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Before, you kind of overloaded by having so much choice of questions 
that you didn’t know which ones would even be useful or meaningful, and by 
limiting your choices you’re actually becoming more functional and it actually 
becomes more useful to you, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that.  
 
Student: I think it’s interesting observing the circle. The context helps the person 
you’re asking to clarify what their motivation is if they don’t necessarily 
understand it, and sometimes we don’t. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
170 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Very often people don’t. A lot of times you ask them, why did you do that? 
Does any here have teenage children? What happens when they misbehave in 
some way and you ask the question that will go down in history from parents 
– why did you do it? What’s the response you get? I don’t know. It’s not even 
a full word, is it? It’s more of a mumble like I dunno. 
 
 
So, it gives you more choices in how to get at information that you won’t 
necessarily get from the direct approach. All you’re really doing is you’re 
investigating thinking. You’re investigating the thoughts that preexist and 
their thinking that allows new thoughts to arise, and there are many ways to 
do that. 
 
 
By slicing the pie in different ways, we’re looking for different qualities of 
information, and some people really won’t respond to the idea of more 
motivation – why do you do it, for what purpose? I don’t know, I just do it, I 
don’t really understand it. 
 
 
That means that they have a big disconnect between their conscious mind 
and their unconscious mind that does the driving. So, if you ask them about 
the context – what does it mean to you, what is this about, what’s related to 
this or how is this related to something else – suddenly they’ll say it’s about 
this, and you can see them getting more excited about it or more fed about 
up about it or more happy about it, so you get at information indirectly that 
way too, which can be very useful in certain contexts when you can’t ask a 
direct question. 
 
 
For example, has anyone here ever been in any kind of negotiation? Isn’t it 
interesting when you’re in a negotiation and you want a direct answer to a 
question like what price are you willing to pay, and they say I don’t know. 
They don’t want to give their hand away, right? 
 
 
So, you ask them other questions that will lead to the same kind of answer. 
You can ask them metaphorically – just give me a ballpark figure, are you 
talking about a Ferrari, are you talking about a Ford or are you talking about 
something in between? Well, it’s somewhere in between. Just give me a price 
range at least. 
 
 
What is you want to be doing with whatever it is you’re buying this – let’s say 
it’s a pencil. What kind of pencil are you looking for? I was looking for a magic 
pencil that will make things fly.  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
171 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
The point is magic pencils will be more expensive than just regular common 
garden variety led pencils. So, they’re already telling you information they’re 
not willing to disclose directly because of indirect things you can ask. Do you 
see how that works? 
 
 
That concept will become clearer as we go on. Right now I just want you to 
recognize it. It’s actually starting off from what the gentleman over here was 
saying earlier on, which is that different from motivation? It’s not, and it is. 
You can ask about any of these layers of things.  
 
 
Ultimately you’ll be asking and probing with lots of different styles of 
questions until some of the questions you start asking will present you with 
things that are clear and concise or very unclear and not concise, which are 
relevant and important and you pursue that. 
 
 
Has anyone ever seen me do a Mind Bending Language demo in terms of 
therapeutic ones? This is a little bit outside of the frame of what we’re doing 
here, but if you watch any of the demonstrations that I have on the tapes, 
people often ask me why did you ask that question or this one, why did you 
pursue this version and this version and so on? 
 
 
My answer usually is very teenage – I don’t know – but the real answer is I’m 
asking lots of questions until invariably at some point one of the questions 
that I ask will throw out something that has an unconscious moment involved 
in it, and that’s when I know that the point of influence has begun. 
 
 
You saw it very clearly here with Amir when he was up here. The point of 
influence wasn’t when he was setting the context. He was very glib and 
smooth in his communication – this, that and the other. Yes, I can use the 
communication and I can use some of the examples he gave me as leverage to 
achieve whatever ends we needed. 
 
 
However, it wasn’t until he went into the frames of reference that I had my 
biggest leverage because that’s when I had an unconscious moment, and if 
there’s a conflict between the conscious and the unconscious, the 
unconscious always wins. 
 
 
That’s telling me you’re right at the doorstep where the biggest leverage for 
transformation, for influencing and so on occurs. He’s telling that to me but

172 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
not directly. Does this all make sense to you? Thank you. That’s a great 
realization. There was another hand over there.  
 
Cassie: 
The amazing part about that exercise for me was not just how closely the 
context and motivation were, but that when you coupled finding that frame 
of reference you mentioned with those power words or with those things that 
you saw those unconscious sparks with you got to a totally different level than 
say, any of the other things we’ve done before. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. This takes me to another point. When you say power words, are 
you talking about the words that they’re using in terms of they were clearly 
infused with? I suspect that’s what you meant.  
 
 
How many of you started using Mind Bending Language power words, the 
stuff we talked about yesterday – the spatial predicates and so on – by 
accident without even realizing it? Put your hands up.  
 
 
What was their reaction when you threw out in just trying to ask a follow-up 
question some kind of mind bending spin type of question, even though it was 
a minor spin? What kind of reaction did you get – or am I seeing it right now? 
 
 
So, as a corollary to what you’re talking about there, Cassie, asking a mind 
bending question – which we’re not actually doing yet – especially as a follow-
up when you see that unconscious moment where they’re going through like 
that, will open the doors even further.  
 
 
It will burst through the bubbles that we talked about yesterday. You know 
that shell that people hold around themselves. The quality of information 
you’re about to get is even better, so a lot of wonderful things happen at that 
point. Thanks for that. 
 
Student: It’s something that’s been on my mind since yesterday and I thought about it 
last night. As the hypnotee I noticed these questions basically disarmed me, 
so the walls didn’t go up. There were direct questions it was like oh, do I want 
to answer this question? And the walls go up. The second thing I noticed was 
that it was almost like conversational truth serum. It brought out the honest 
answers that I gave for myself. 
 
Igor: 
I actually like that phrase ‘conversational truth serum dot com, if anyone 
wants it. This is true. If you look at any literature on interviewing techniques, 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
173 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
specifically forensic interviewing like police and so on, one of the things they 
do is they observe body language a lot for stressors to see which one is lying, 
but really there’s a difference between finding out when someone’s lying and 
getting the truth.  
 
 
Do you understand there’s a distinction between that? There’s a no man’s 
land in between the two. One of the things they do to actually get the truth is 
to create so much pressure in the situation that the truth stumbles out. It’s 
called a Freudian slip. It’s when you mean to say one thing and you end up 
saying ‘your mother.’ 
 
 
In terms of that context, what they’re doing is they’re piling on the pressure 
so that the person is trying to think about the answer that they’re not trying 
to give, but because it’s already in consciousness it slips out. There’s that 
word again – think. 
 
 
The unconscious mind is, generally speaking, honest. It’s rare to get 
unconscious deception. It can happen but usually it’s not unconscious 
deception; it’s more unconscious protection of an emotional need and so on. 
That’s stuff we don’t need to get into. Thank you. That’s actually very true. 
 
 
Did you all understand as well that as these questions proceed – provided you 
teach them indirectly that you will be nonjudgmental, that you will not be 
attacking their mind – that suddenly things slip out that you didn’t know were 
there or that you would not normally share with other people? Would that be 
fair to say? Thank you for that. That’s a great realization to make. 
 
Student: The interesting part was that I was talking to somebody that I’ve known for 
less than 24 hours and I was amazed what I was telling them. 
 
Igor: 
Right. This is the beauty of it. As human beings we can connect to each other 
very, very quickly and very, very deeply. Those of you who came to the 
Conversational Hypnosis Mastery Course, we talked a lot about how to create 
that instant rapport there as well, using slightly different mechanisms. 
 
 
The point is that it’s possible and what we’re doing here is we’re pulling away 
those defensive layers. This is why I like covert hypnosis so much because you 
can get at what the real stuff is without having to spend hours wading 
through all the bull stuff.

When I teach Conversational Hypnotherapy, I always tell people that one of 
the reasons I especially like Mind Bending Language is because I can have a 
little chat before we begin. Let’s have a little chat just to find out what’s going 
on. We haven’t started yet. 
 
 
I will fix the problem then so that when it comes time to do the hypnosis, it’s 
easy. Close your eyes. Open then. Are you done? Yes, how did you do that? 
Well, it’s a special brand of hypnosis. It’s the close your eyes, open your eyes 
technique. So, thank you for that. Thank you very much. We have a question 
over here. 
 
Student: This is more of an observation that we’ve had with my group of partners, I’m 
sure it’s a theme that others have noticed, but there’s a lot of altruism in this 
group at the core purpose behind many of the people I’ve been speaking with 
and the one that I share, is everything we’re learning is always for the purpose 
of sharing with others. I think that’s a testament to the frame and the context 
that you deliver everything to us. I just want to let you know that either 
nobody else liked what you were saying and they’re not here, and those who 
had originally come with other ideas are finding a deeper purpose that’s more 
altruistic in sharing this knowledge.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you for saying that, and do pull the curtain back on the Wizard of Oz. 
You’re right on both levels. There are some people that I’m very happy to 
have hate me because I’m not interested in that kind of influence. This is very 
short-term.  
 
 
This is what most people think of hypnosis – power over you, make you do 
something or force you to do something. To be fair, our marketing also has 
those hot words included in it because people respond to that at some level.  
 
However, in my opinion, true power looks like this. That’s what real influence 
looks like. It looks like a normal conversation where both people are happy. 
You’re creating a communal win-win. The reason I call this true power has 
several layers to it. 
 
 
First, this creates defense mechanisms. There is a vast amount of literature in 
most of the therapeutic or hypnotic community that talks about something 
called resistance. There are some who don’t because they don’t get it. What 
they get is the next step in the process for transformation and so on.

There is a vast amount of literature in the sales community, for example, 
about overcoming objections. There are a few salespeople that don’t seem to 
get them. Are you beginning to see a little theme going on here? This 
approach to influence, the power model of influence, is short-termist.  
 
 
Yes, you may get your way in the short term. It’s kind of like a con trick. If 
you’ve ever been conned by a conman or a con-woman, do you go back and 
do it again? No. So, it works once but the second time you see it coming, even 
if what they have to offer is actually genuine and valuable, you want nothing 
to do with it because they’ve burned their bridges. They’ve destroyed the 
trust. 
 
 
This approach to influence, whilst it can work in the short-term, in the long-
term creates distrust. In the long-term it creates more barriers. In the long-
term it makes you less influential.  
 
 
This approach on the other hand is one that becomes stronger over time. In 
other words, the more you influence someone, the more they want you to 
influence them.  
 
 
I had this conversation with one of my executive coaching clients way back 
when. He was an interesting chap, really smart and a really good guy. His 
department was I think making more money and had more turnover than 
virtually all the other departments combined. I mean he was a serious high 
performer. 
 
 
The problem is he was burning about 99% of his team out in the process. 
Basically everyone who came to his team asked within a year or so to be 
moved somewhere else, and many of them actually left the company and the 
company didn’t like that at all because it’s had to hard to recruit talent. 
 
 
So, he was actually believe it or not so successful given the particular model 
he was running that he was on the verge of getting fired because of this. 
Hence, they came to me and said fix this. One of the key distinctions that we 
worked on was basically, understanding leadership styles. 
 
 
This is what a lot of people think leadership is about – I tell you and you do it – 
versus a leadership style where people come to you saying what else can I do 
or what more can I do?

One of the key elements within that was when I asked him the mind bending 
question, what do you think would happen if you set up the workplace in such 
a way that everyone who works for your team could fulfill their most 
important values in life in the process of working with you – whatever those 
values be? 
 
 
Whether that’s taking care of their family or growing as a person or learning – 
you know there are different things that drive different people, right? What 
do you think would happen to those people if in the process of working for 
you, they were actually achieving or actualizing the most important values in 
their life? 
 
 
He said the classic answer – huh? We spent the coaching program really 
exploring that as an idea to the point where people were refusing to leave his 
department. You see, the same thing was going on now.  
 
 
They were working just as hard in many ways, but think about it this way. If 
you’re working hard at the expense of your personal life values, missions and 
so on, you have a time limited window. You’ll put up with this for now to get 
to something better in the end, and if you don’t you’ll create what’s called 
burnout. 
 
 
If on the other hand the very act of doing this task is giving you the emotional 
payoff of having your life’s greatest values fulfilled, that’s a recipe for an OCD-
style workaholic, isn’t it? That’s actually called a fulfilling job. That’s actually 
living your dream job, isn’t it? 
 
 
I have an interesting idea to present to you that you may want to 
contemplate. There is no activity that any human being has ever engaged in 
that cannot be somehow enjoyable or valuable. It’s a question of perspective. 
Pretty much everything you can think of, someone’s done and enjoyed. 
 
 
If you think knitting is boring, there are people who love it. If you think 
collecting postage stamps is boring, some people love it. If you think that 
having exciting vacations, life experiences and so on are exciting, some people 
hate travel. So, it’s the mindset that’s there. 
 
 
If that’s the case, if we’re talking about a mindset – which is just the process 
of thinking – then you can create a win-win for everyone in almost any 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
177 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
situation. It’s only a question of figuring out what is the big enough picture so 
that everyone’s mindsets or points of view on this idea change. 
 
 
Do you get the idea of where I’m going with this? We haven’t really explored 
this as an experience yet and we will build into that, but I just want to offer it 
here because it kind of fits what we’re talking about. 
 
 
Are there any other comments or questions in terms of what we did in the 
exercise? We have one more in the back. 
 
Student: I have a question for you about Amir. What I saw when you asked the right 
question was not only was he gob smacked, you know that look, but it 
seemed to me that he flushed his lips up fuller, it was a big emotional 
experience. Is that right? (Amir says yes) It was a big experience. I just wanted 
to confirm what I was seeing.   
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. What tends to happen here is when you’re creating mind bending 
moments, we’re using questions as our primary tool – mind bending 
questions if you want to get very particular with it – but really what we’re 
doing is we’re creating mind bending moments.  
 
 
We’re trading thoughts for thinking, and that thinking gets attached and when 
that gets attached to motivation, in this case through the idea of context – 
and of course you’re going to get a huge payoff when you get to that – and 
that is the very thing that makes transformational change, influence, 
persuasion, sales and everything else really easy. 
 
 
What makes it hard is if what you’re doing is indirectly closing all the doors on 
you inside the mind, but if you open enough doors you’ll find a door that fits 
both of you, and that’s really what you saw happening there. 
 
Student: My question is, is there such a thing as a right or a wrong question to ask, and 
if there is, what’s the punishment? 
 
Igor: 
Bad boy! So, what do you mean by right? 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
What do you mean by wrong? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
178 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
Based on those ideas, right and wrong is really a concept that doesn’t fit this 
model of influence. Why? It’s because it focuses on an exclusively 
indoctrination process. I have the right idea. Anything that is an agreement or 
enhances my idea is right. Anything that conflicts with my idea is wrong. 
That’s basically how we perceive right and wrong. That’s kind of where it 
comes from. 
 
 
We’ll take the idea of ethics and stuff like that aside for a moment because 
that’s gets into a different ballpark. Taking a more educational point of view – 
which is my preference – there are only things that are useful that move the 
process along and things that inhibit. 
 
 
In fact, you could go one step further – and I would – which is to say there are 
things that make that process of influence efficient and effective, and there 
are those things that make it inefficient or ineffective. 
 
 
I think that asking any question or making any statement is absolutely valid. 
It’s merely a question of how efficiently is he getting you or how effectively is 
he getting you to the outcome you have in mind?  
 
 
By the way, asking the “wrong” question sometimes could actually be more 
efficient and more effective at getting your outcome than asking the right 
one. Would you like to know how that works? Well, in that case, you better 
come back nice and sharp after lunch.  
 
 
Let’s give you an hour and half. Be back here at 2:00 o’clock and we’ll start at 
10 past 2:00. Thank you very much.

Creating Transformations 
 
 
Driving Questions 
 
Igor: 
How are you doing? Is everyone good? Who enjoyed this morning’s session 
on the whole Mind Bending Language thing? Who feels like they really 
learned something?  
 
 
Even though we haven’t actually addressed Mind Bending Language directly, 
you’re already beginning to notice we’re making connections towards Mind 
Bending Language whilst asking these kinds of probing questions. Is that true? 
 
 
There are a couple of things I want to talk about before we go into the next 
segment of it, and that is first of all this idea of how do you know what 
questions to ask? What’s the right question? 
 
Student: Since you put it on the board. 
 
Igor: 
I was going to tell you. 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
I was going to tell you. I will give you examples of questions, but I hope I’m 
not such a hypocrite that I will say get a soapbox, school – bah humbug – and 
then say now remember this is the only list that you use. It’s not about that. 
All that matters is what is the impact that your questions are having? What is 
the information that you’re getting back? 
 
 
Any question will do. Even the “why” question – my God I asked the wrong 
question. No, there’s no such thing as a wrong question. It’s just a question of 
did you get the result you needed from that question? If you didn’t, their 
response will tell you that and you can correct your course.

For example, there’s a student of mine that I was mentioning before who 
spent five or 10 minutes recruiting people at a meeting and had them sign up 
to an $1,800 program (within 10 minutes of meeting them by the way).  
 
 
I was having a few people test the influence model that we’re going through 
right now. When he was doing that, the first thing he came back with was I’m 
getting it all wrong because every time I talk to them about stuff, I get them 
complaining about this and that and I get stuck in this complaining loop. 
 
 
Did he ask the wrong question? Maybe yes or maybe no. It’s not a question of 
the wrong question. All he had was information that’s going to define what 
the next set of questions should be because how on Earth would he know that 
complaining is such an important part of that particular group of people until 
he starts asking stuff? 
 
 
Then it’s just a question of okay if we get stuck on complaining, what do you 
do now? That’s a much better question to ask yourself at that point. Never 
think that the question you have is not good enough. Ask it and then evaluate 
and start assessing the quality of the information you get out of it.  
 
 
Is it relevant that they complain a lot? Yes. Is it important? No. It’s only 
important that you know that it happens a lot, but spending half an hour 
listening to someone gripe about their life is not useful in terms of the 
outcome he was looking for. 
 
 
In relation to having people sign up to his coaching program, half an hour of 
complaints was not a significant or important factor. It was important only to 
know that it exists because it’s part of the leverage at that point.  
 
 
As soon as he recognized that, it’s a question of how do we break through 
that complaining cycle so you can get back on track with the influencing cycle 
to get back onto the sales cycles, shall we say. Do you understand the 
distinction we’re drawing here? 
 
 
In a moment we’re going to go back to doing some more questions of a 
different style, some more probing questions of a different nature, but I want 
you to remember that part because really you’re exploring stuff and there is 
no such thing as responding incorrectly.

 It’s only a question of are the questions you’re asking efficient and 
effective? 
 
 
If they’re ineffective, you may get slapped. It’s true you might not enjoy that 
part but then you’ve learned, and you’ll probably drop something else out like 
a nonjudgmental part or something else. That’s what you really need to do. 
 
 
Believe me, I’ve made more mistakes than probably all of you in this room 
combined and been very embarrassed over it too, but I’ve learned from it. 
The problem when that happens is that people have thoughts about that – oh 
I’m terrible, I’m no good.  
 
 
If you ask a question and you get a response that is (a) not what you 
expected, and (b) not helpful – in other words it takes you away from the 
process – that’s the point at which you need to turn your thoughts into 
thinking, and that’s where all this stuff has grown from for me.  
 
 
It’s from making mistakes and thinking furiously how on Earth could I have 
handled that situation so that if it happens again I can do it better? I cannot 
prepare you to be perfect at Mind Bending Language. It’s impossible. What I 
can prepare you for is the mindset, their style of thinking that will get you to 
that point. Do you understand what I mean by that? 
 
 
The next idea is something that most of you are doing but some of you are 
beginning to kind of lose track of because there’s a lot of other stuff on that 
list, and it really belongs right here.  
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions – Curious 
2. Non-Judgmental 
3. Validation 
4. Columbo Approach 
5. Pauses 
 
Remember the power of pauses. Don’t get so consumed by the probing 
questions you’re asking. There are only two styles you have so far anyway. 
Don’t get so consumed by those probing questions that you’re so busy 
thinking of a clever question whilst missing everything that’s going on in front 
of you.

I have no idea what questions I’ll ask when someone’s sitting down here. All I 
know is I’ve got to throw out some general question to start things off with 
and see what comes out. If it’s useful, if there’s something even vaguely 
interesting in it, it already delineates my next question. 
 
 If they answer in a way that has some kind of motivation aspect, I’ll 
start asking motivation probing questions.  
 
 If there’s an aspect of that that talks about the context they find 
themselves in or the frames that they relate to, I’ll dig into that 
because that’s the first thing that came up. 
 
 
So, I don’t necessarily have a plan to start off with. By the way, this makes my 
life right now a lot more difficult because whilst I’m doing my demonstrations 
up here, I’ve got to limit myself to asking a question that is not even relevant 
yet. 
 
 
With Amir, did you notice that I was “struggling” for the first few set of 
questions because I wasn’t getting any unconscious moments, was I? I had to 
let the cycle run until there was something that emerged that allowed me to 
actually ask a useful question.  
 
 
All the other stuff was useful only in the sense that it gave me more insight 
into his conscious processes, and then when I actually got a hint of something 
unconscious – and it was only a little hint – I just stepped on that. As soon as 
you get an unconscious moment, you pause things and you jump on that. 
 
 
How you’ll know that’s happening is whilst they’re busy talking, you’re 
thinking what’s the next question, what’s the next question? Or if you’re 
related to Wittgenstein, it’s what’s the next question, what’s the next 
question? 
 
 
What I encourage you to do – and please consider doing this in the next 
exercise – is ask any question, even a stupid question like hey how are you? 
Dang, I’ve asked that already. How are you? Good. Is that useful? No. So, 
Mind Bending Language, isn’t that something? Yes. Okay, curses, two strikes. 
What is it that interests you about Mind Bending Language? Oh, it really gets 
to people.

Suddenly there’s a bit of a spark lighting up. You think oh this is interesting. 
Now you have different directions you can go in. So, you really want to get 
through to people, do you? Yes. What’s important about that?  
 
 
Now you’re going down the motivational route and you say which people are 
you trying to get through to? That gives you a context, right? Now I don’t 
know how to ask that question.  
 
 
I don’t know which question to ask. I cannot prepare for that question 
because I have no idea which bits he’ll light up on, which bits he’ll be routine 
on, which bits he’ll be defensive about and which bits he’ll be going 
unconscious on. 
 
 
Has anyone ever seen a still pond – hands up if you have – a still pond, a body 
of water that has no ripples in it? Really? Four of you? Have any of you ever 
been outside of your homes? Has anyone ever run a bath and turned the tap 
off – still water, yes? Okay. 
 
 
Imagine that you collected ripples and the only way you can collect ripples is 
in your memory because when you throw a pebble in a still pond or a still 
body of water, you’ve got to observe it to recollect it and then you have a 
memory of ripples. 
 
 
What did you? You throw a stone in and as soon as you throw it, you start 
looking through your bag for a good stone to throw. I don’t understand. 
Which one’s a good stone? Well, this one’s going to be really good. Oh, that 
one was obviously no good because there are no ripples. 
 
 
If you’re too busy looking through your bag of stones, you’ll miss the ripples 
you’re trying to collect. Do you understand what I’m saying? So, let’s be ripple 
collectors. 
 
 The last thing I want you to think about as we go into the next exercise 
is don’t get yourself stuck on just one type of question. 
 
Some of you are asking a lot of how questions and they’re great questions. 
Some of you are asking a lot of where questions or what questions. If you find 
yourself stuck on a particular kind of questions like, how’s this or how’s that, 
then start mixing it up.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
184 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Throw in some other questions to see if other information will come out. 
Don’t get stuck at one level of questioning even though what you’re trying to 
do is going to be limited to one particular type of probe.  
 
So, you can probe the context for example with many different questions: 
 
 When do you want to use Mind Bending Language? That’s a context, 
isn’t it?  
 
 How do you want to use Mind Bending Language? That could give us a 
bit of a context.  
 
 When you’re in that context, what is it that you’re doing?  
 
 What are you thinking about to let you know if you’re doing a good 
job? This gives you frames of reference. 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? Don’t get stuck on one level of 
question. Start mixing them up a little bit more and just have some fun and 
see what comes out.  
 
Do you know a voyeur is or a peeping Tom? Have you heard the term? 
Honestly, I was acquitted so it has nothing to do with me, right? You’re going 
to be essentially hypnotic voyeurs. You want to have a look inside someone’s 
mind and there’s no better way to do that than to ask questions. 
 
If you ask the same question constantly, it’s like trying to peep into the curtain 
– not that I’ve done this of course. It’s like just getting that one angle where 
there’s no action. You can go around the other side of the house where the 
curtains are open, so explore different styles of questions. 
 
I’m not going to give you a specific question until you’ve found your own – by 
the way, if you listen to me doing demonstrations, you’ll get a lot of those as 
well – because it’s more important that you develop your own style and your 
own trust in finding your own questions than that you memorize a list that I 
happened to have used. 
 
Hopefully this all makes sense. Can we end this indoctrination program now? 
Are there any questions or comments on anything we’ve done so far? In that

case, I’d like to have a microphone and a volunteer please. You don’t have to 
bring both. I just have to have a volunteer from the group.  
 
We’ve already had Amir and Linda. Give her a round of applause. 
 
Demo: Driving Questions 
 
Igor: 
Come on up. Have a seat up here. It’s always a pleasure to see enthusiasm. 
When someone’s stand on their tip-toes on top of their chair, it’s like yes I 
think I might have a motivated volunteer there. How are you doing? 
 
Student: I’m doing great. 
 
Igor: 
Is your mic on? 
 
Student: Hello. I don’t sing. 
 
Igor: 
That’s okay, nor do I. Actually, I do sing. It’s just that it’s better if the room is 
empty when I do. I may otherwise be arrested for causing public dismay. 
 
Student: You’d probably get acquitted. 
 
Igor: 
But not if I start singing my defense. So, onto different matters. The rapport 
part is over. You’re here of course at a Mind Bending Language seminar and I 
presume that in terms of the exercises you’ve been doing so far today that 
you’ve learned a little bit more about yourself in relationship to that Mind 
Bending Language. Is that right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, you know a little bit more about your motivation, a little more about the 
context you want to think about it in, and the frames of reference you have 
and so on, right? 
 
Student: Yes, in fact I changed it from my first motivation to a second one. 
 
Igor: 
Which is a common thing when you actually get in touch with what’s more 
important than whatever’s at the surface, right?

Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, give me a sense of what is that motivation you had, the deeper one? 
 
Student: The second one is actually a practical one because I got a speeding ticket a 
couple months ago, and I had a really good reason for speeding but of course 
the officer can’t accept a reason. You either did it or you didn’t. So, I have an 
opportunity to speak to the Crown attorney in a different language. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here. We can see where this is going. 
 
Student: So, I want to get off and I want to know how to use Mind Bending Language 
for him to agree that I shouldn’t be… 
 
Igor: 
Let me pause you there again. Thank you for indulging me on this.  
 
Student: I’m all excited. 
 
Igor: 
I can tell. Let me just ask it this way. Is that the only reason you’re interested 
in Mind Bending Language? 
 
Student: No, the reason I’m really interested is because I want to be like you. I want to 
be as good as you are or better. 
 
Igor: 
Well, you can get a haircut. 
 
Student: Sure, if that’s what it takes. I’m close. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just take a little timeout here if that’s okay and talk about that. 
Obviously there is a pressing situation that of course will be very motivating, 
but it’s not the real motivation behind learning Mind Bending Language, is it? 
There’s a bigger motivation. It’s just that this one’s the most apparent right 
now. 
 
 
There are two reasons why I paused you in that process. One is that I’m 
getting derailed. Remember my purpose here is to make someone a better 
mind bending hypnotist. Will helping resolve the speeding fine help her be a 
better mind bending hypnotist? Probably, but there’s a problem here.

We don’t have all the pieces of the puzzle together yet, do we? So, I could 
spend the next two hours coaching her on Mind Bending Language and totally 
bypass the purpose of being here, because my second purpose of course is to 
teach you something about the next step to do, which this particular 
motivator has absolutely no bearing on. 
 
 
In other words, what we’re about to do in resolving that question – there’s a 
relevancy problem here. So, I’m going to challenge on that level. How do we 
do it? I asked a mind bending question, although it’s not really that mind 
bending – is that the only thing you’re interested in? 
 
 
We have a bigger motivation, which is I want to be more like you. There’s 
some explore that I can do around that, but because I’m not dealing with 
motivation right now, I’m not going to go down that road so much now. I’m 
just explaining to you why I’m doing that. 
 
 
I’ve had to sideline the speeding ticket because it will interfere with the line of 
questions that I want even though I realize that you want to do this. However, 
I will make you this promise. To the extent that you’re willing to sideline the 
speeding ticket issue for now, we’ll be able to explore something that when 
you really get the grasp of that concept along with the other things we’ll be 
building up, when it comes to actually talk to the public defender – which you 
have to talk to of course – will significantly increase your chances of having 
them dismiss the ticket. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
I can’t guarantee they’ll do it of course, but it will significantly increase those 
chances. Is it okay to sideline it for that? 
 
Student: Actually it is, very much so. 
 
Igor: 
Is there a congruency in terms of the response there? I have to do that 
because otherwise one motivation will interfere with the other motivation, 
and that will interfere with my two purposes.  
 
 
One which is to help you of course become a better mind bending hypnotist, 
which will ultimately help that but right now we’ve got to go down a different 
path to get there.

And of course it will interfere with my purpose for you guys, which is to do a 
demonstration that you can get something valuable from. So, do you 
understand why I did that? Do you now understand the important, 
significant, relevant assessment of thinking?  
 
 
It’s not that there’s no value in those thoughts. There’s a great deal of value. 
It’s just that the value in that particular element comes later in this cycle. My 
influence cycle is five days long, which is the length of this course. So, the 
value of that bit of information will become relevant in about two days’ time. 
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? Right now I’m redirecting towards just 
general things. So, you want to me more like me. What does that mean to 
you, by the way? 
 
Student: I love the idea of having excellence in what I do and to be able to help people 
reach whatever it is they’re looking for as fast as possible. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. All I’m doing right now is I’m establishing a context, a frame and a 
bit of motivation. In other words, I’m doing my best to shortcut what you’ve 
been doing all morning because I didn’t have this discussion with you, and 
now we can get into the meat of questions. Just to summarize, you want to be 
more excellent at what you’re doing so you can be a more influential 
communicator. 
 
 
In what particular context are you thinking? Are you doing more therapy, 
persuasion, sales or is this for pretty much everything in your life? 
 
Student: Mostly therapy at this point. Some sales, but it’s mostly therapy. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful. This is useful to know. How long have you been studying 
Mind Bending Language? 
 
Student: Well, I learned starting in NLP about 25 years ago. 
 
Igor: 
And specifically Mind Bending Language, the kind of style that we’re doing 
here? 
 
Student: I would say 10 years. 
 
Igor: 
So, you’ve been studying this kind of thing for about 10 years? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
189 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: Yes, but the best one I got was yours about two years ago. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, about 10 years ago you came across the similar concept as Mind 
Bending Language. It was at whatever degree of easiness or difficulty to learn, 
and about two years ago you came across my material and you’ve been 
studying it since. 
 
 
So, you’ve really been interested in Mind Bending Language for at least 10 
years, and then of course you’re increasing your skills as you go along. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Again, I’m just setting a context to allow me to actually start the questions. 
When you first came across Mind Bending Language, what is it that you were 
curious about? 
 
Student: It made me excited to know that the curiosity gave me answers that I could 
use to help the client come to the resolution they needed. 
 
Igor: 
So, you can create that state of mind that can give you answers that this client 
needs to resolve their problems? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What kind of questions have gone through your mind over the last 10 years? 
You must have had a lot of questions about the concept of Mind Bending 
Language, the application of it and so on. What kinds of questions have 
arisen? Whether or not you’ve answered them is another matter. 
 
Student: I would say the most important question – at least at this point – was why it 
took longer than what I had been trained to do over the years. When I saw 
people training, they could do it really fast, so I wanted to at least get to that 
point.  
 
 
So, the questions usually were how do I do it better, how do I do it faster, how 
can I be more effective? 
 
Igor: 
So, the idea about how to do it faster, better and more effective, it’s kind of 
like the Olympiad of Mind Bending Language. You know faster, better, higher.

Student: I hate to lose, so for me a client reaching what they came for is in fact a win. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Let’s take a little timeout here. What kinds of questions did I just 
ask? It’s relatively apparent, hopefully. It’s basically a question about the 
questions. It’s once again an additional way of establishing context and 
motivation, but now I’m asking essentially, what are the driving questions that 
drive her in this field? 
 
 
By driving, it’s basically another way of looking at motivation but it’s asking it 
in a way that she would not normally talk about motivation. She wants to be 
faster, better, more efficient and work with her clients in a better way. Right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And how much of that question have you resolved over the years? 
 
Student: Pretty close to 90%. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
How do you do that? 
 
Student: Mind Bending Language and also profiling. 
 
Igor: 
And profiling. 
 
Student: Yes, the profiling is very important. 
 
Igor: 
So, by profiling your clients and by learning concepts like Mind Bending 
Language, it’s taken you about 90% of the way to the kind of level of speed 
and eloquence and proficiency that you want. Is that correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. What kinds of questions drive you now then, because you’re so 
close to your goal?

Student: There’s always more. We can always be more excellent, I think. For me it’s a 
sense of responsibility as well that I owe it to that client who’s trusting me. 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask it this way. If you had a chance to ask one question that you knew 
you would get an absolutely intelligible answer to, that would allow you to 
achieve the actual goal that you want and beyond that much more, which 
when you heard the answer you would not only recognize the truth of it but it 
would allow you to go beyond your current wildest dreams of what Mind 
Bending Language can do – what would that question be? 
 
Student: I’m confused. Are you asking me if I asked a question of the client or asked 
the question of myself? 
 
Igor: 
If you were to be able to ask someone – myself, yourself or anyone else – a 
question about Mind Bending Language, which if the answer was satisfying to 
you, would give you the key to go far beyond what you currently think Mind 
Bending Language is capable of, what kind of question would that be? 
 
Student: How do I identify the client’s personal power that they don’t know so that I 
can get them to recognize it? 
 
Igor: 
Did you see the quality of that response? Is that a question worth engaging 
with? So, how do you find the personal power inside the client that will allow 
them to basically supersede or transform where the problem? Is that right or 
have I misunderstood that? 
 
Student: Well, the profiling system I use. I don’t know if you know the Enneagram.  
 
Igor: 
Yes, I know the Enneagram a little bit. 
 
Student: I studied it about 12 years. It has continued to amaze me at its accuracy, so I 
count on it quite a bit and it lets people off the hook right off top. The 
judgmental is gone. It gives them a reason for why they aren’t succeeding at 
what they want and then the solution. 
 
Igor: 
So, the Enneagram has provided you a lot of the answer to that question. 
 
Student: Very much so. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
192 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
But not everything. So, if you found another answer that went beyond the 
Enneagram and maybe profiling – but included it – then you’d have something 
that would really allow you to go much further with Mind Bending Language 
and helping people than you’ve currently gone. Is that accurate? 
 
Student: Yes, it could be that’s available. If it’s available, yes. 
 
Igor: 
If it’s available, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did you notice what just happened there? Who would care to hazard a guess 
as to what that is? There is a form of resistance – I wouldn’t necessarily call it 
resistance because I don’t actually believe in that as much. There’s a defense 
mechanism there. 
 
 
 
What do you think that defense mechanism is about? There’s a pretty high 
chance that it’s about one thing. Permission is close but not quite. It’s 
protection 100%. That’s my best guess. 
 
Student: Maybe I can’t do it. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Let me ask you this then. This is the way to test. Are you suggesting 
that if such a system existed, you’d be delighted but you’re kind of a little 
afraid that it doesn’t exist and you’re kind of fooling yourself? Is that what 
you’re suggesting? 
 
Student: No, I think I’m afraid that I might not find it if it does exist. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. So, if it does exist, you might not find it. 
 
Student: Or recognize it. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. So, we’re pretty much there. It’s a protective mechanism. If you knew 
you could find a system or a method that would allow you to have the kind of 
results that the Enneagram has given you so far but go far beyond that – 
which may be actually included in the Enneagram but maybe beyond or 
outside of it – then that would be a system worth looking for, wouldn’t it? 
 
Student: Absolutely, yes.

Igor: 
I’m curious as to what questions you haven’t asked yet. 
 
Student: Do you know that system that I’m looking for? Does anybody know it and they 
could teach me? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. That’s one question. That’s actually a very useful question because now 
you can seek outside and maybe do research and so on. That’s what research 
does, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s how you found the Enneagram and that’s how you found other things. 
 
Student: I have another question. 
 
Igor: 
That’s good. 
 
Student: Can you eliminate or change whatever’s stopping me from seeing it? 
 
Igor: 
Now we’re getting into some very good questions, aren’t we? I have a sense 
there’s an even better question as well. 
 
Student: Oh, good. Can you tell me what the question is? 
 
Igor: 
That’s my question, but those few questions are superb. Those are very good 
questions. Let me put it this way to you. When you think about all the things 
you know about Mind Bending Language and the Enneagram system you use 
in combination with that, all those things, all the understandings that you 
have and the experiences you have had, what are just some of the things you 
haven’t considered in the experiences you’ve already had, which will allow 
you to grow in a way you hadn’t thought of before? 
 
Student: Maybe I’m better than I think I am. 
 
Igor: 
Now let me just pause here. Do I have a direct road into something useful? 
Yes? I should say so. Did I have any idea we would get here? No. By the way – 
and I hope you don’t mind me talking about this – did you notice the slightly 
vulnerable but very emotional way she said that? That tells me there is a lot of 
juice on the surface here. You know that’s true, right?

Student: I can feel it too. 
 
Igor: 
You can feel it, right? 
 
Student: Yes, I can. 
 
Igor: 
Here’s the interesting part. We’re going a little bit more into therapy if you 
don’t mind. We may as well because it’s there and it’s very charming of you to 
go there. 
 
Student: Thank you, yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, just remind me of that question again. 
 
Student: Maybe I’m better than I think I am. 
 
Igor: 
Maybe you’re better than you think you are.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
To the extent you go beyond the way you have been thinking, only then will 
you find a better way of being, won’t you? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What’s that? What just happened? 
 
Student: Being is something I’ve worked with for year and the value and the 
truthfulness of it and the power of it, and that’s exactly what I do with my 
clients is I move them to state of their own being and I could only do that 
because I had to learn it. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Now aside from all the ways you’ve been so far, what’s the one 
way you haven’t thought of yet? There you go. Take your time. 
 
Student: I think I’ve been trying to prove something and maybe I don’t have anything 
to prove and secondly to stop judging myself. 
 
Igor: 
Now we’ve got it. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
195 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: Yes, stop judgment myself. 
 
Igor: 
Stop judging yourself. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Because when you go beyond that judgment, there’s a way of being that far 
exceeds Mind Bending Language, Enneagrams or anything because then 
you’re at a place where you’re not – the limitations you had before, right? 
 
Student: Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
What’s it like to be in that place because I have a sense you just got very close 
to that, didn’t you? 
 
Student: Well, I have been there a few times actually. 
 
Igor: 
You have, haven’t you? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What’s that like? 
 
Student: It’s indescribably amazing and I would say the core of it is self-love. 
 
Igor: 
Self-love, right? 
 
Student: Yes, and one of the things I’ve had to really learn over the years. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Something about self-love and you know that in at least some 
contexts you can do that very well, right? 
 
Student: Yes, absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
Like what? 
 
Student: When I’m working with my clients, I’m observing myself as I do it and I am not 
thinking. It’s flowing and I can completely trust that absolutely and then also 
when I hold my cats.

196 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
When you hold your cats. 
 
Student: Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
How are those two situations similar? 
 
Student: Love. It’s love. 
 
Igor: 
It is love and I have a sense you’re experiencing some of that love right now, 
aren’t you? 
 
Student: Yes, and I’m very grateful. 
 
Igor: 
The big question is; is that feeling of love increasing right now? 
 
Student: No, not yet. 
 
Igor: 
Not yet. 
 
Student: But I know that it can. 
 
Igor: 
You know that it can. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
How? Are you noticing where we’re going with this? I’ve gone a little bit off 
track of what we’re doing just because I got a very genuine response and I 
have to honor that. Is that okay with you guys if I do that? Plus you get to see 
a different aspect of this too. 
 
Student: Because I’ve been there before, I can identify I’m not quite there yet but I can 
accept it also as part of that. 
 
Igor: 
You’ve been there before. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
197 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
And you’re very close to it now. You still feel that love. It’s just there’s some 
little thing missing. What’s that little missing thing about? You can see the 
probing questions, right? 
 
Student: Let’s see. What’s missing? 
 
Igor: 
You can see the unconscious moment, can you not? Really think about that 
because I have a sense that when you really think about that, you’ll discover 
there’s more – to you, I mean. 
 
Student: Yes, I think there’s a part of me that wants to resist it. 
 
Igor: 
And what’s that about? 
 
Student: But it’s not a conscious resistance. 
 
Igor: 
Of course not. 
 
Student: What’s it about? I think the people that I’ve studied and modeled and read 
about, I think I see them at a level of where I want to be that I yet can’t trust 
myself to know how to literally be there. I’m not sure I can recognize it even if 
I am until after it’s over. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so that’s an interesting question, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Just repeat that to yourself. You’re not even sure you can recognize that 
you’ve been there until it’s over. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, if you can’t recognize you’ve been there until it’s over, how would you 
know to not trust yourself now when you could be there already? 
 
Student: You’re right. I don’t know. 
 
Igor: 
So, something interesting is happening now. Notice what’s happening – that 
sense of love right now. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
198 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Yes, it changed. 
 
Igor: 
Isn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And is it growing now? 
 
Student: You’re giving me a way out of the resistance actually. 
 
Igor: 
I’m actually not doing that. Believe it or not, it’s all you and it is growing, isn’t 
it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Now I know that you have no conscious idea of how that happened. I 
understand that but then you don’t need to know how to trust, do you? 
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
You just do. 
 
Student: You just do. 
 
Igor: 
And I have a sense that you are. 
 
Student: That’s always there. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Student: If I haven’t got the outcome, I still know that trust is the catalyst. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so you’re having the trust now and that sense of love is growing? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I wonder how long you have to wait for it to grow enough for you to look back 
on your Mind Bending Language, and even the Enneagrams, and see it in a 
whole new light.

Student: Acceptance about now. It’s acceptance, is the answer. 
 
Igor: 
So, what are you accepting? Let me just pause you here a second. What’s 
happening right now inside your body? Is it strong? 
 
Student: Very. 
 
Igor: 
It is very strong, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Very. 
 
Igor: 
So, for a moment whilst I may continue talking, I don’t need any answers from 
you because I think what you’re experiencing right now goes far, far, far 
beyond any need to even describe it because it’s not about me. It has nothing 
to do with me or even them. I suspect that a door has just opened, has it not? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And what’s the point in talking about it when you can just be there? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, take your time. You can do this with your eyes closed if you prefer it that 
way. They disappear. Really respect that. There you go. Because this is huge 
and there’s so much more to this. 
 
Student: You know it’s the last understanding of my own depth that I’ve been looking 
for consciously for 25 years. 
 
Igor: 
And you’re finding it now? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Isn’t that something? 
 
Student: Yes. Thank you. It is. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Really rest with this. This is something worth really experiencing, 
and don’t worry, in a moment you’ll get a chance to sit back down if you need 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
200 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
to just relax and let people do an exercise. This is more important than 
anything else you could do right now. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Is that something you’d like to do, just to sit quietly for a bit with this? 
Because I don’t think you should rush this open door. It’s something worth 
exploring. 
 
Student: Yes, I think I’ll go for a walk in the hallway. 
 
Igor: 
Would you prefer to go on your own or would you want one of the assistants 
to come with you? 
 
Student: No, I’ll go on my own. Thank you. I’ll be okay. 
 
Igor: 
I understand that. 
 
Student: Whatever level of gratitude is the greatest, I know you’re saying it’s not you 
but let’s put it this way. You’re a reflection of me, so I’ll thank you, thank 
myself and thank everybody here. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you too. 
 
Student: Thank you so much. 
 
Igor: 
So, rather than interfere with what’s going on, I’m just going to invite you to 
have that walk, and we’ll catch you up on everything else that’s happened 
whilst you’re on that walk. I guarantee that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you so much. Go ahead and enjoy that. Give her a round of applause. 
Just come back when you’re ready.  
 
 
Did anyone expect that was going to happen? Of course I knew that was going 
to happen all along, didn’t I? 
 
 
When did that door get opened? Really this is the only type of question I was 
focusing on. I was looking for questions that she was asking herself that were 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
201 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
driving her and then checking whether there were any answers to those 
questions. 
 
 
I was a little surprised when she said that 90% of it had already been delivered 
with the Enneagram and so on. Ten percent is not very much. It’s not really, is 
it? So what the heck are you doing here getting all motivated and getting all 
fired up when you’re so close anyways and, more importantly, the way she 
said it – yes, I’m really striving for this – there’s a lot of desire there, isn’t 
there? But I’m not 90% of the way there. 
 
 
Did she sound like a woman that’s 90% to completing her biggest life’s 
dream? Not really. So, what tells her is that the 90% is really something she’s 
fooling herself on at some level.  
 
 
It’s just looking at the logic of the situation. It wasn’t until we started asking 
about the driving questions – forgive me if I don’t recall the exact question 
because I was kind of in the moment at that point – but I think the big one 
was the question if you had the one question you could ask that you’d get 
whatever you want to have. That’s where we started getting this really 
genuine response. 
 
 
Did you notice there was something very interesting going on. Did you notice 
there was a disconnect between how she was talking about things and what 
she was experiencing? It was like a conscious-unconscious dissociation, like 
something’s going on but I’m going to try to give you some ideas about it, but 
they were only very loosely related to what was actually happening, which is 
why at some point I asked her to stop talking because it was more important 
than that. 
 
 
Did you see it intensifying as soon as she stopped talking because the 
conscious mind stopped interfering, which is another talking about this whole 
sliding away to normality thing. 
 
 
So, really we got there by asking what are the burning questions that drive 
this person? It’s looking at motivation in a different way. Remember it’s 
question that drive thinking, so I’m looking at what are the thinking processes 
that are already going on, and when we found it, the extra stuff we did on top 
of that really wasn’t so much about asking questions.

That’s just using the motivation we’ve obviously got only because I recognized 
we had such a deep or vulnerable unconscious response that I couldn’t just 
leave it there. It wouldn’t have been fair to her. So, I appreciate you letting 
me poke her a little bit further with that. 
 
 
Did you also notice that there were lots of stumbling blocks along the way? 
This is obviously a very big deal for her and there’s a lot of fear attached to 
that. Oh, you’re back again. That was a short walk. Did you want to add 
something to the experience or do you just want to hang out there a bit? 
 
Student: It reminded me that when I work with clients I get that result with them, but 
then what would happen is when I came back into the world so to speak, I 
recognized that it added to my value but I didn’t recognize my value was 
actually already there.  
 
 
I wasn’t recognizing it. I thought I was getting value from succeeding as 
opposed to knowing that the value was being represented by them and 
mirrored back to me.  
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Now here’s the question, which goes back to the whole Mind 
Bending Language thing, taking that value you now know you have, can you 
reevaluate everything you know about Mind Bending Language in that light? 
 
Student: I’m sorry I didn’t hear the last part. 
 
Igor: 
Can you reevaluate all that you know about Mind Bending Language in light of 
that? 
 
Student: Yes, I have complete trust. 
 
Igor: 
And that was the bit that was missing before, wasn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
You haven’t done the exercise yet. You haven’t done anything with this yet, so 
you don’t know from experience how much you’ve grown but you do get to 
find out, don’t you? 
 
Student: Yes, thank you. I will.

Igor: 
Are you looking forward to that? 
 
Student: Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
Do you believe her? Thank you very much. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Driving Questions Continued 
 
Igor: 
So, the exercise is very simple. We’re going to be looking for driving questions 
and some of the answers they have had to that, and I’m only interested again 
in which questions are they asking that have juice.  
 
 
It’s another way of looking at the motivation and purpose issue, but do you 
notice how a very different quality of information came out? It also puts me in 
a context at the same time. I’m getting frames of reference – her relationship 
to herself versus her relationship to others. 
 
 
 
Points of view – I’m seeing it from my own eyes. I’m seeing it from my client’s 
eyes. I’m seeing it from these different positions, so it gives us a different 
quality of information that relates to what is driving or motivating her in 
terms of learning Mind Bending Language, which is also where the 
unconscious mind will step in and say great, at this point you’re now free to 
explore Mind Bending Language in a new way and develop insights you can 
only reach from this place. 
 
 
This goes right back to the Einstein quote: You can only resolve a problem 
with the consciousness that is different from the one that created it. Do you 
have any questions about the exercise? Is it straightforward?  
 
 Ask some general questions to kind of get oriented into the person, and 
then specifically you’re looking for what questions are they asking 
themselves?  
 What drives them in the form of the questions?  
 What answers are they looking for?  
 What answers have they found already?

 If they’ve found answers, what questions have those answers implied or 
not satisfied yet, because that gives you another aspect of what thinking is 
going on inside that person? 
 
 
Get in different groups of three – A, B and C – just as before. Find a group of 
three and then I’ll start you all off at the same time. Off you go. 
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back everyone. How are you doing? Did you enjoy that? What 
interesting things did you learn or deduce from that experience? Did you have 
an interesting experience or did you just talk about life, the universe and 
everything? Go ahead. Stand up so we can get a mic to you. 
 
Student: I found that having people asking their own question is very powerful in 
launching the thinking process. So it’s difficult to have a pre-made thought 
about it. 
 
Igor: 
Right. Let me put it this way. First of all when you were being asked the 
question about the questions you ask yourself, who found themselves: 
 
A. Becoming a little bit more inspired or motivated by the subject itself;  
 
B. Actually strangely started to develop some clarity about questions that 
had puzzled you anyways. Did any kind of clarity start coming out? That 
also happens. 
 
C. When you were being asked the questions about the question you’re 
asking yourself, who found themselves starting to think furiously, you 
get absorbed by that question and you kind of start thinking about 
stuff again? In other words, going beyond where you thought the 
limitation of that thought was going to be. 
 
That’s the useful thing about asking questions. On the other side, either as A 
or C, when you’re evaluating or assessing the quality of their thinking, who 
noticed that when you find out the questions that they’re asking themselves, 
it gives you a different aspect, a richer experience in terms of how they’re 
doing things?

In other words, if you were going to influence this person, who here feels they 
now have more leverage in terms of how to do that? Let me give you some 
examples. 
 
Let’s say that you were some really outlandish professional like a 
hypnotherapist. I know none of you are here, so we’ll choose something 
which is obviously not applicable.  
 
You talk to a client and he says I don’t know I’m ready for therapy, and it 
might be useful for them. You just got into a conversation. What’s therapy 
about? Oh, this and that and the other.  
 
But all you did is ask them questions – how is your life, how’s this, how’s that? 
Then you hit something that has a little bit more juice for them and you ask 
them questions like what kind of questions do you ask yourself about that?  
 
Let’s use a specific example. Let’s say it’s weight loss. What kinds of questions 
do you ask yourself about weight loss or your ability to lose weight or about 
the shape that you’re in? Well, I ask myself why am I like this I’m so fed up 
with it? 
 
I ask myself things like what can I do to improve or change it? Sometimes I ask 
what’s wrong with me that I can’t lose weight? These are the kind of things 
you might anticipate, right?  
 
So, you get some good idea around that and then you might dig a little deeper 
and throw in some Mind Bending Language to get a better quality of 
response. So, aside from all those questions that you already know about, 
what are the questions behind all of those that really drive you to want to lose 
some weight? 
 
How can I be more lovable? How can I be more attractive? How can I like the 
person I see in the mirror? These are deeper answers you might be getting – 
just supposing. 
 
First of all, even if you went down the mechanical route – which I’m about to 
go – even if you never did anything else, what are the chances if someone (a) 
knows you’re a hypnotherapy; (b) knows you specialize in weight control; and 
(c) has opened up enough to you to tell you that the question they’re asking 
themselves is how can I like the person I see in the mirror?

What are the chances that if you just turned around and said look, it sounds 
like there’s something very important going on in there, and of course this is 
exactly what I handle on a day-to-day basis.  
 
I don’t know if you think you’re ready to come in and actually find the answer 
to those questions, but if you are, I have appointments on Monday, Tuesday 
and Wednesday. It’s a cheesy ending but you get the idea of where I’m going 
with this. 
 
You don’t even have to make a particular hard close but if you are, just talk to 
me. Yes, you know I really want to do this but I’m not sure if I can. Now you’re 
going down another spiral, right?  
 
Are you beginning to see how just learning how to ask these questions in a 
respectful way, using Mind Bending Language to get a better qualify of 
information out, that on its own can be deeply persuasive. You haven’t even 
had to deal with objections or any problems with that yet. 
 
Do you understand that? Are there any comments or questions on that level 
so far? Are there any comments or questions on anything we’ve done at all?  
 
Amir: 
When I’m working in the context of therapy, when I’m working with clients, 
the first thing I do is I ask those questions. I go right for the motivation. For 
some clients it’s just so easy because they have it and it’s bing, bing, bing, 
done and total transformation. 
 
 
I find that the single factor between the success and the failure with my 
clients are really two things – if I didn’t catch the motivation or find it within 
them because then that sustains the change over for the rest of their life 
really, and the other aspect is that thinking aspect. I guess I have a two-part 
question. I don’t know where I’m going with this, but how can you find a 
motivation within a person when you can’t find it. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s just take one thing at a time. I understand the spirit of the question but 
I’ll use the actual frame you used for it, which is how can you find the 
motivation in a person when you can’t actually find it? That’s a really good 
question to ask, isn’t it? 
 
Amir: 
Yes.

Igor: 
I suspect that it’s something that’s kind of infuriating you in terms of you’re 
really furiously looking for the answer. 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Would you say that you’ve been driven by that question? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
If they don’t know what motivates them, they do know what drives them or 
what questions they’re asking themselves, and if they’re not asking 
themselves any questions, if they just say I don’t know, then it’s just a 
question of helping them find questions to ask. 
 
 
Let’s put it this way. By the way, this seminar is not about therapy. You 
understand that, right? However, he’s not asking me a therapeutic question – 
although it sounds like it – he’s asking an influencing question. How can you 
get someone to have motivation in the first place? 
 
 
We all have motivation and here’s one thing in the context that you find 
yourself in that you’ve neglected to think about. Are you ready for this? It 
won’t be particularly mind bending but it might be insightful for you. They 
came to your office. Why? 
 
Amir: 
I asked myself that question to. 
 
Igor: 
Stop asking yourself. Ask them. Why did you come? I don’t know. Would it be 
useful to role play that for you? Would that be useful? Give him a round of 
applause to come up here. 
 
Demo: Role Play – Finding Motivation 
 
Igor: 
The only reason I say this is because it’s very clear and you can obviously see 
there’s a logical inconsistency. It takes an insane amount of motivation for 
someone to bother to come to a therapist’s office, especially a hypnotist 
because hypnotists do this!

Believe me getting someone to actually want to come to an office is a huge 
thing. First of all having them bother to call. That in itself is a huge 
psychological hurdle to get through. Then they’ve got to talk to you and then 
they’re frightened because they’re talking to a hypnotist. You got to get past 
that bit. 
 
 
Then they’ve got to book an appointment. Then they’ve got to spend the 
week between booking the appointment and coming to the appointment 
trying to not talk themselves out of coming because they’re going to see the 
hypnotist and maybe deal with the problem or even try to face the problem, 
whether or not it will work in the first place. So, the fact that they’re sitting in 
your office means something, doesn’t it? 
 
Amir: 
Most of the time – I’d like to say yes but I’m finding experiences that are 
telling me otherwise. 
 
Igor: 
So, be that person. Can you be that person? Think of a specific person that did 
that. Now this will be a little bit awkward because he’s kind of channeling and 
he hasn’t got the full frame of reference but we’ll see where he takes us. So, 
you’re here to do what? 
 
Amir: 
Lose weight. 
 
Igor: 
Great. How come you want to lose weight? 
 
Amir: 
To be thinner would be nice. 
 
Igor: 
That would be nice. Good. That sounds like a really bland reason to want to 
change. Is that really why you’re here? Let me put it this way. Why did you 
come here today? 
 
Amir: 
Because I want to lose weight? 
 
Igor: 
Okay now are we getting closer? I’m goading him a bit. Really? I don’t believe 
you. Why the heck would you want to lose weight? You don’t seem 
particularly excited by it. Is he looking now? Are we getting a different quality 
of response? 
 
Amir: 
Yes.

Igor: 
So, what’s going on? You do really want to lose weight. Is that right? Let me 
put it this way. There seems to be a bit of a conflict going on. At one level it 
sounds like you do really want to lose weight and that’s genuine. Is that 
correct? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Am I right or am I wrong? 
 
Amir: 
Yeah, you’re right. You’re right. 
 
Igor: 
Really? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
On just that level on its own – forget everything else – what would losing 
weight do for you? What is it that you want to get out of that? 
 
Amir: 
It would make people like me more. I’d look better in the mirror. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. But there also seems to be some hesitation about that, isn’t there? 
 
Amir: 
Yes, it’s a lot of work. 
 
Igor: 
It’s a lot of work. 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And that’s where we have it. The fear of work is blocking the willingness to be 
motivated to change, and the defense mechanism is like I’d kind of like to 
change it. It’s kind of like yeah I’ll give it a try. It’s the fear of failure indirectly 
in this sense, right? 
 
 
So, I need to resolve that conflict first. So, aside from all the work you think 
you might have to do, what’s everything that being a slimmer, trimmer you 
would do for you?  
 
 
Really think about that. Beyond just the normal things you say to people to 
make them agree with you, there’s something really important and maybe 
even there’s a question that’s been driving you about this whole weight loss

thing. I don’t even know what that would be but I have a sense that you’re 
getting close to something there. Can you sense that? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
You haven’t necessarily got a full answer. I appreciate that because we’re 
dealing with some bigger psychological issues. I understand that. However, 
there’s something there behind all that stuff, behind the fear of all the extra 
work, and the effort and will I succeed or won’t I succeed and all that stuff. 
Behind all that, there’s something isn’t there? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What’s that? 
 
Amir: 
A drive to be better, to be the best that I can be. 
 
Igor: 
To be the best that you can be. You just want to join the Army. 
 
Amir: 
No. To do what I can. I’m role playing here – I’m sorry to interrupt you. I’m 
popping in and out of this conversation and trying to figure it out. What I’m 
realizing is this is the learnings.  
 
 
I thought I’d thought of all the ways to do it and I haven’t, so I’m seeing now 
and to a certain extent I’ve done that, but I feel like I’ve given up because I’ve 
had some clients that just weren’t as motivated as the other clients. They’re 
not as easy to influence in that sense, so I just kind of feel like these people 
don’t have it, they don’t want to have this and I realize that that’s wrong. 
 
Igor: 
By the way, in terms of being a businessperson, there also comes a point at 
which you have to make a choice. You may have to spend an entire session 
getting someone motivated, but then that’s still your time going into it and 
you have to choose do you want to help this person, or do you have enough 
other clients that you’ll do this bit for free? 
 
Amir: 
Right. 
 
Igor: 
Or do you want to fire your client and see if that will shock them into being 
motivated, which is something I like to do just to see the look on their face. 
You’re fired. What?

This is actually how I normally would frame it, and this is just giving you like a 
more kind of direct advice, which is we go down that road and say look it 
sounds to me like there’s a bit of a conflict. You kind of really want this at 
some level but there’s something blocking it. Is that right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
There are two ways we can go about this. Either you can home now and really 
think about what you want and come back to me when you know you want to 
lose weight, and all the things you think are going to be in the way, I can help 
you deal with those and believe it or not make them a heck of a lot easier 
than you currently think; or we can spend today’s session focusing exclusively 
on that, just finding what is inside you that will prove to you that you can 
make this change easily and really enjoy that process. 
 
 
Then we can focus on the actual weight loss in the future sessions. Of course 
that’s a separate extra step that we’ll taking, etc. It’s just a question of 
framing that in that sense. 
 
 
Otherwise if I can do it in the first 10 or 15 minutes, I’ll have plenty of time to 
do the session. I’ll expect that. If after half an hour there’s still extra stuff that 
needs to be done, then I’ll give them that offer.  
 
Amir: 
You know what’s interesting about exactly what you said was I’ve heard you 
say that exact thing before, but now it’s going in. Repetition is good. 
 
Igor: 
Did I influence him? Oh, it’s not repetition. 
 
Amir: 
Oh, it’s not? Just the experience to grab it or… 
 
Igor: 
Before, your mind was already made up. Now it’s not. 
 
Amir: 
Fair enough. 
 
Igor: 
Try that on for size. Doesn’t that fit? 
 
Amir: 
Yes.

Igor: 
Are there any follow-up questions for that? Do you have a follow-up 
question? 
 
Amir: 
Yes, I have a question. What are some ways – okay different context – more 
as a trainer because they train in hypnosis and NLP, so what are some ways 
that you can get people to think more instead – I mean you do an excellent 
job here getting people to think, but what are some ways that you can get an 
audience to think as opposed to just sit there and drool and listen to 
everything you’re saying? 
 
Igor: 
That’s a bigger question. 
 
Amir: 
I know. 
 
Igor: 
I’ll give you the short answer if I may to that one. 
 
Amir: 
That’s cool. 
 
Igor: 
Get them to start thinking about questions, asking questions. The smaller the 
audience, the easier it is because you can single people out and the larger the 
audience is, the easier it is for people to hide. I’ll give you another little trick if 
you want but it’s not related to Mind Bending Language – but it kind of is. 
 
 
If a large audience is being sluggish – in other words I’m trying to get them to 
think but they’re like yeah I’m thinking (yawn) – at that point it usually tells 
me it’s time for them to do something physical to break their expectations. 
 
 
Everyone stand up and do something. Then come back now. Quick, what is 
the answer to this question? People are like what? I haven’t really thought 
about that. Of course I’ve only been asking the question for half an hour, but 
you’ve changed their state. You’ve changed their expectation. You’ve changed 
everything about them and now the question has somewhere to go. 
 
Amir: 
It’s kind of annoying because I know this but I’m not doing it. 
 
Igor: 
One other thing – and this is kind of what we’re doing here, and actually we 
may as well put some of these lessons in here because this is important. Give 
him a round of applause. He did a great job.

Baby Steps & Emotional Reframing 
 
Igor: 
Now we’re getting into the process of asking questions, which are getting to 
some pretty big stuff. If you ask too big a question, you will freeze or paralyze 
people’s thinking because of the very soap box rant that I’ve been going on 
about the last few days. 
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions – Curious 
2. Non-Judgmental 
3. Validation 
4. Columbo Approach 
5. Pauses 
6. Baby Steps 
 
 
Because they think they have to have an answer and that question’s too big or 
vague for them to answer, they’re frightened of it and therefore they’d rather 
sit there a comatose defense state than to answer it.  
 
 
If you want someone to think who isn’t, ask them a question they can actually 
answer. Then ask them another one they can also answer that’s a little bit 
trickier. What’s Mind Bending Language? Why are there no hands going up?  
 
 
Let me put it this way. Let’s see how many hands go up now. What is your 
favorite aspect of Mind Bending Language? What’s the bit that really charms 
you? Hands up. Why did I get more hands going up? It’s because that is an 
easier question for you to answer. 
 
 
To me it doesn’t matter what questions you’re answering provided you are 
answering questions. Of course there are some damaging questions like what 
are you such an idiot? That’s not a good question to answer. You realize that, 
right? 
 
 
But by making the question easier for you to answer, it makes it safe for you 
to answer, which means you’ll start thinking about it to get an answer. Once 
they have success with one question, they’re like oh I kind of enjoyed 
answering that.  
 
 
Did you notice this by the way? When people are asking these questions, 
aren’t they interesting? Did you kind of enjoy saying yes this is what I think? I

can talk now for a change without being interrupted constantly with what you 
think instead of what I think. 
 
 
Once you start that thinking process going, you can start escalating it faster 
and faster. Over a period of time you can start asking harder and harder 
questions and they will rise to the challenge, but if you ask too large a 
question, too big a question too soon of an audience that has been damaged 
in the way that we’ve already discussed, then the old pattern will kick in.  
 
 
Fear will kick in and exactly the same problem that you had with the client 
you role played will kick in, and it’s safer to not think at that point because if 
you don’t think or if you don’t even try to answer the question, how can you 
feel the pain of not knowing the answer? Oh, I could have answered it. I just 
didn’t feel like it. Do you see what I mean? You want to take baby steps.  
 
 
The other part of it is what I’ll call an emotional intelligence reframe, but 
another way of thinking about this is blatant flattery and genuine 
appreciation.

Igor: 
May I borrow you for this just because I know you’re mentally robust? Come 
on up again. Give him a round of applause because he’s about to go into the 
lion’s den on this. Have a seat. Okay, what’s hypnosis? 
 
Amir: 
Well, it’s suggestion that people take in to become better. 
 
Igor: 
What’s important about hypnosis? 
 
Amir: 
That it can help people.

Igor: 
Why do you hypnotize people? 
 
Amir: 
To help them. 
 
Igor: 
What are the principles involved in hypnosis? 
 
Amir: 
It’s attention… 
 
Igor: 
What am I doing right now? 
 
Amir: 
Just bombarding me. 
 
Igor: 
I’m bombarding him. It’s an FBI interview, isn’t it? I’m asking it pretty much 
the same way. It’s like where were you Sunday night at 2:00 o’clock when that 
poor woman was murdered in her room? That’s really what a test does, isn’t 
it? It lists a bunch of questions where there’s an implication that clearly you 
can get it wrong. 
 
 
That is once again psychologically offensive but it’s an attack. This is why I 
thank you for coming up and doing this. I have attacked Amir with these 
questions – what’s hypnosis? Maybe. Okay, what’s suggestion then? 
 
Amir: 
I can’t even look at you. It just feels... 
 
Igor: 
Right. I am blocking everything. Am I doing anything even vaguely to take 
good care of him on an emotional level? No. Now I’m going to carry on asking 
hard questions in exactly the same way, but I’m going to change my style. It’s 
the same questions with a different style. 
 
 
I apologize for all that silliness but you do have some ideas about what 
hypnosis is, don’t you? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What would those be? 
 
Amir: 
Well, hypnosis is like the act of… 
 
Igor: 
See the difference?

Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s ask another hard one, which he stumbled on. I understand – and please 
correct me if I’m wrong – that suggestion is part of hypnosis as well? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, how does suggestion fit into hypnosis? 
 
Amir: 
Well, suggestion is easy because you’re giving a person an idea and on some 
level they’re going to take it in and use it for themselves. 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate you taking time to answer these questions because this is kind of 
important to me, and you clearly seem to know what you’re talking about. So, 
I’m not sure if you can actually help me with this because a lot of people have 
to waffle around with this, but hopefully you have a clearer answer than 
most. What is suggestion, do you think? What is actually the nature of 
suggestion? 
 
Amir: 
It’s giving them exactly what they need in the form of words… 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you right here. Haven’t I asked the exact same questions 
again? How much easier is it to answer those questions? 
 
Amir: 
It’s so much easier. 
 
Igor: 
So, it’s not that he doesn’t know the answers. It’s not that he can’t come up 
with answers. It’s not even that I’m asking him easier questions this time 
because I’m not. It’s the same questions.  
 
 
The only difference is that I’ve take care of his emotional wellbeing, and we’re 
not Mr. Spock. We’re not just minds of logic who don’t care about anything 
else other than reason, rationale or anything like that. We’ve got to take care 
of people emotionally, especially when we’re dealing with difficult topics. 
 
 
We’ve got to know when to back off a little bit and when to come back on 
again a little bit and say I realize that’s a difficult question. Let’s do a role play 
here. Let’s say you want to lose weight and you get all defensive. So, why do 
you want to lose weight?

Amir: 
Because it will help me… 
 
Igor: 
Let’s try that again. I’m going to ask you why you want to lose the weight and 
you get defensive on me. 
 
Amir: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
So, why do you want to lose weight? 
 
Amir: 
Because… 
 
Igor: 
Do you see he’s defensive? I apologize. I may have phrased the question a 
little incorrectly. What I’m really getting at is clearly losing weight is important 
to you. Isn’t that right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And I appreciate that even coming here to talk about it is actually quite a 
courageous act because there are a lot of emotions and other things involved 
for you in doing that, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What I’m really curious about – and hopefully you can just give me a little 
sense of this – is despite all the obstacles you’re facing, clearly there’s a lot of 
other stuff going on and you can kind of feel it right now, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
How come you came to lose weight anyway? 
 
Amir: 
Because it’s… 
 
Igor: 
It’s the same question, isn’t it? This is probably the most important part of all 
this is can you take care of their emotional wellbeing? Can you emotionally 
frame or reframe the nature of your question asking so that: 
 
 They realize they’re not going to be judged other than in a positive 
way.

 They’re not going to be made to feel stupid. 
 You don’t think you’re better than them – the Columbo approach. 
 You validate that their ideas actually have a right to exist. 
 They have a right to exist as a person. 
 They have a right to be resistant or have defense mechanisms or feel 
bad things. 
 They may have been violated in the past. 
 
 
You told me you’ve been to other weight control courses and so on, and I 
understand they haven’t worked for you and that’s kind of disappointing. 
Personally, I’m a bit shocked that they turned around and said oh you’re being 
resistant and it’s all your fault when clearly it’s their process that’s not 
working. 
 
Amir: 
Yes, I totally understand. 
 
Igor: 
Emotional reframe. I want you to know that I may ask you some hard 
questions from time to time, but please understand it’s only because I need to 
get at what’s really going on because personally between you and me, I know 
you can make this change. I really know you can do this.  
 
 
I know you haven’t done it in the past and you may even doubt yourself right 
now, but there’s some little part of you inside that knows you can do this. 
Otherwise you wouldn’t be here. Do you know what I mean? 
 
Amir: 
Yes, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you see where we’re going with this? Do you understand the value of this? 
Has this been useful? Give him a round of applause. Thank you.  
 
 
Are you beginning to see that there are a lot of keys to doing any kind of 
questioning work, and especially Mind Bending Language?  
 
 
These are the non-verbals, the subtle things that come with it. This is the stuff 
that you’ve been really focusing on and that assessing thinking part is your 
strategy beginning to tell you which way to go with it.  
 
 
So, you’re beginning to evolve some important or interesting tools that will 
help you not just master Mind Bending Language, but understand that it goes

way beyond the language. It goes into the whole nature of the conversation 
that you’re having.  
 
Student: As you were reframing, I think I saw a pattern that before making the reframe 
you paced the emotion. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: Whether directly or indirectly, you matched the emotion before setting the 
reframe, and that’s something that I don’t know if it was part of the 
technique, or… 
 
Igor: 
All I’m doing is I’m validating the fact that it’s okay to have that emotion 
because let’s face it, given the context we just had there, that emotion has 
been rejected by them and other people all the time. This is bad. This is not 
good.  
 
 
Remember yesterday, it was Tao who was saying I’ve now got this weird 
spinning feeling in my head and it’s just silly stuff and I’m not going to think 
about that. It’s the same essential thing. There is something unpleasant going 
on.  
 
 
In this case you were judging yourself partially, and it’s only by getting past 
that, by accepting that it’s okay to do that but you don’t need to if you don’t 
want to, that all the other doors opened up.  
 
 
All we’re doing is validating them and saying it’s okay, you’re okay, you can 
have doubts, you can have fears, you can have an unpleasant thing because 
that’s how life is sometimes. Despite all that, or maybe even because of it, 
you can still make that change, etc. 
 
 
All I’m doing is I’m validating the experience and I’m proving to them in doing 
so that I’m not judging it. They’re really the same concepts. I’m just splitting 
the same concept up for ease of understanding. So, if you want to think of it 
as pacing, by all means do so. 
 
 
Personally, I think of it as validating and acknowledging it. It exists. I’m not 
afraid of it. I’m not judging it harshly. I’m actually going to value it. Let’s put it 
this way. Let’s take the example of someone who was very self-critical. It’s like 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
220 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
yeah this is horrible, I wish it would just stop, I wish I would stop thinking 
these thoughts. 
 
 
Yes, I understand. You really want these thoughts to stop and yet they’re 
serving some important function. They’re clearly doing something because 
they’ve stuck around for a long time. I’m going to start taking the side of his 
resistance.  
 
 
Whatever he’s resisting, whatever he thinks is bad, I’ll take that side and say 
whilst I know you wish it would stop and it would be a lot more pleasant 
when it does – notice the presumption – right now I want you to realize that 
it’s going to carry right on doing it until it’s done its job, and right now you 
don’t know what that is, do you?  
 
 
Can you feel a mind bending moment coming on? What? Huh? This is from 
the Ericksonian approach of course. I’ve not just joined his resistance but I’m 
now controlling it. So, go ahead and have your doubts. You can do better than 
that. They’re doing something, so you may as well let it do its job properly. 
 
 
Now maybe it’s not doing its job just right. Maybe doubting in that way is not 
the right thing. Maybe doubting whether or not you can lose the weight isn’t 
really what you ought to be doubting. What do you mean? Now we’re right 
into Mind Bending Language, aren’t we?  
 
 
Think about it. Given all the things that you are capable of as a human being – 
your brain, your neurology and so on – how much effort do you have to put 
into staying this one way? So, to the extent that you can doubt the right thing, 
you will change. What do you mean?  
 
 
Well, think of it this way. Your mind’s constantly changing. Your skin’s 
changing, your age cells, you’re growing things, your hair grows, your nails 
grow. Things are constantly changing. Can you stop your nails from growing? 
No. Doubt it. Go on. That’s silly.  
 
 
Of course it’s silly because you can only physically change, and if you can only 
constantly physically change, that’s part of your mental makeup. Your brain is 
also physically changing. So, if you’re going to doubt something for real, I’d 
doubt your ability to hang onto your weight – seriously – because you’ve had 
some serious skills to keep it on. What?

Well, think about it. It’s not just that you’re keeping weight; you’re gaining it. 
So, if anything’s worth doubting it’s your ability to not change because if you 
can gain it, you can lose it.  
 
 
Now I’m slowly leading them down a different path. Do you see where I’m 
going with this? Can you hear the mind bending strategies going on here? 
Hopefully they make more sense now. It’s not that I’m just being clever with 
my language. I don’t care about the language. 
 
 
I’m trying to steer his mind from doubting being a terrible thing to doubting 
being a good thing. Let’s recruit doubt into something useful. This is an 
example. It’s a throwaway, which goes back to the idea of nonjudgmental and 
validating the person in their experience. 
 
 
Has this been useful to you, demonstration-wise and experience-wise? Did 
you have a follow-up to that? 
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other questions or comments before we end the day? 
 
Student: I was just going to say just do what you did with all of us that want to lose the 
weight, so the rest who don’t want to lose weight can leave and we can just 
have you take us through that. 
 
Igor: 
I suspect you already are, aren’t you? Here’s the thing. Did you notice how 
our list of keys that will make Mind Bending Language work is actually longer 
than our current list of probing questions, which is not much bigger than our 
types of Mind Bending Language patterns? 
 
 
There’s a reason for this because the artistry is not in the language, although 
you can really play with the mechanics and so on. This is very useful to do, but 
the artistry comes in understanding what comes out of these questions in 
combination with your attitude here. 
 
 
When you get these things right – and when I say right, I don’t necessarily 
mean that there is a right way and a wrong way. What I mean is that there’s 
kind of a dimmer switch in terms of doing things. You get a little bit of it right 
and you recognize it and say this is good.

A little bit of that will grow into a little more of that because where attention 
goes energy flows. Your mind and body grow into what you pay attention to, 
and you’re going to pay attention to the inside, how you feel, when you say or 
do something that has the impact that you actually want and you’ll see it in 
their reaction and you’ll feel it in yours. 
 
 
That’s the only judgment of what is right. You’ve seen me do many things 
wrong but they were wrong enough to become right because all that’s 
happening is you’re getting more information.  
 
 
You’re building up a clearer picture, image, idea or concept of how that 
person is thinking, or more likely what thoughts they’re having routinely so 
that eventually you find those thoughts, the leverage you need to open a 
doorway. 
 
 
Notice how with I think it was Joanne who was up here earlier on, remember 
the first few doors we had were all closed, were they not? She had already 
figured out all the answers. It’s when we came across the questions that we 
found new material, new doors that hadn’t been considered before, and 
that’s when they started opening.  
 
 
It’s just a long-winded way of saying ask your questions and be curious about 
their thinking. How are they thinking? What’s going on inside their mind? 
Follow that. Pursue it. Don’t plan your questions ahead. Allow their response 
to bring you to another place and another place. 
 
 
You have maneuvers. You know that you can find motivation and purpose, 
and in doing so you find tremendous leverage to open the mind. You know 
that you can find a context, a frame of reference or the point of view that 
they’re using in order to understand the problem in a particular way, or the 
limitation that they have, and that they’ve got questions they’ve asked 
themselves, questions that need answers and answers that make them forget 
that the questions they had originally were actually more important than the 
answer that they found. 
 
 
We have more of these categories that we haven’t even touched on yet, but 
we will. Right now my hope is that you’re deeply curious about people at this 
point because already you’ve found a tremendous pathway into them. 
Remember these eight or so keys we’ve had so far:

 Asking questions. 
 Being nonjudgmental. 
 Validating them as a person or their responses. 
 Being willing to take the Columbo approach from time to time. 
 Pausing to let them absorb the experience or actually have it. 
 Taking baby steps, asking small questions that lead them step-by-step 
along the way. 
 Importantly, taking care of their emotions. 
 
 
You already have a tremendous toolkit. With all those ideas in mind, I would 
like you to do one thing today. Think back on your experiences of actually 
using Mind Bending Language – for example yesterday – and notice how 
primitive even your highest successes then look to you now, and the only 
reason that can be is not because those approaches were necessarily 
primitive. It’s because you have evolved far beyond those. 
 
 
Hopefully that makes sense to you in some way now. Would that be fair to 
say? That’s something that you really should be proud of for yourself. I would 
give yourselves a round of applause for having gotten to this place, and if you 
want to have more from where that came from, then be back tomorrow as 
well.

DVD 7 – Deconstruct A Persons Framework 
Using MBL Spins, Reconstruct, Uncover & 
Know The Ins And Outs 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Good morning everyone. How are you doing? Welcome to day seven. It feels 
like it, doesn’t it? Who feels like they’ve been working out a bit in their 
minds? Good. I thought we’d start today in a more sort of gentle way.  
 
 
If you have any comments in general about what you’ve been learning so far 
or if you’ve had any insights over the last couple of days, or if you have any 
questions about what you’ve been doing, now would be a good time for you 
to ask them. 
 
Student: Good morning, Igor. I have a question, a kind of insight that came yesterday 
and maybe you have some hints on how to deal with that. I found that it’s 
quite difficult to multitask, so it’s easy to be an observer and see what’s 
happening and look for the nonverbal cues, but then once you are the 
hypnotist and you need to do all of these things at the same time, I find that 
kind of difficult. 
 
Igor: 
I get it. If you’re anything like myself, the first time I ever drove a car, you 
know you have your signals and your mirrors. I learned to drive in Europe of 
course, so they have a clutch and I had to use my foot. I was actually very 
excited for my first lesson because in England when you’re 17 you get your 
provisional license. 
 
 
So, I pulled out for the very first time and I feel like I’m a speed freak. I’m 
going a thousand miles an hour. Of course the car is barely rolling past one 
mile an hour. Old ladies on their bicycles are faster than me. Probably the 
Zimmer frame as well, right? 
 
 
So, it felt like a total overload. It will at first because you have new skills. 
You’re trying to keep track of other stuff. Right now by the way, you will have 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
225 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
more chances as we continue this program to actually go back and practice 
things.  
 
 
I realize you haven’t practiced a lot of the actual questions and so on, and 
that’s because what we’re doing here is so unusual in our culture, which is to 
ask good questions, that we need to do a lot of stuff around the actual small 
experience of asking questions to make them improve, but you will have more 
and more opportunities to ask more and more questions. 
 
 
What you’ll find is at one point, your mind will just click and it will probably 
happen in here for many of you. For some of you it will happen outside of 
here, where your mind just clicks and you just ask these questions because 
you’re interested, because you’re curious. 
 
 
Meanwhile you’re seeing stuff and you’ll naturally be in that observer and 
reactive state at the same time, but it is a function of having a little bit of 
experience behind you. 
 
 
The best thing you can do right now is not worry about it. One of the reasons 
why in the exercises you put you into all three roles is precisely so that you 
get a chance to have all three experiences. As time goes by, for some of you it 
will be here because you have more experience already. Some of you will just 
have to play around with it a bit more. 
 
 
You’ll actually find that you won’t just get the two positions – the A and the C 
– integrated. You’ll actually do all three. You’ll actually be able to have a sense 
of an intuition about what they’re experiencing and where they need to go 
with it, and that’s when you get really good.  
 
 
That’s when the real strategy comes out. Right now you’re doing a little trio 
training wheels. It’s just a function of time and a little bit of experience. Does 
that help? 
 
Student: What about taking small baby steps on that to, so maybe trying to 
concentrate on one small thing? I noticed yesterday that when I did not 
expect to see or offer verbal communication, just look for one small 
unconscious cue. That was helpful and actually I picked that up. Would that 
help too or is it just better to let go entirely? 
 
Igor: 
Yes.

Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a very good question. There are many different ways of dealing with it. 
The best way to learn something is to go to a very small detail, and then go to 
a very big picture, and then go back to small and back to big. You’ll have an 
experience of that later on today. 
 
 
It’s kind of like the freeway phenomenon or the motorway phenomenon. You 
know when you’re driving at 100 kilometers or miles an hour – whatever your 
speed limits allow you to do, because of course I know all of you obey the 
speed limits – and then you come off the freeway or motorway and back into 
your regular roads, or better still you get into traffic, you may still be breaking 
the speed limit but it feels like you’re crawling along because your brain has 
basically switched. 
 
 
It’s time distortion and this is time/space distortion, so the same thing will 
occur here. At some points, I would encourage you to push yourself to just go 
beyond what you think you’re capable of. At other points, you just relax and 
do nothing.  
 
 
At other points, you’ll focus on only specific things and let everything else fall 
apart. By jumping between those three points, all the different positions will 
start integrating over time. Excellent questions, by the way. Thank you for 
that. Are there any other comments, questions, insights, praise? 
 
Student: This is more of a comment. It was very much like what she said. I was hoping 
that at some point in time all this would just click and that I would be able to 
leave here with this intact and know how to use it. That’s the comment. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, I appreciate the desire for that because, as I said, I spent eight years 
having the same desire. I suspect you will all be getting to that point much 
quicker than I did, so lucky you. 
 
 
What I can’t do is I can’t guarantee when that will happen because each one 
of you will be at a different point in the development cycle. What I can do 
here and what I am doing here is giving you enough experiences so that you 
can trust your own mind to make that happen for yourself.

There are a lot of pieces. It doesn’t seem like much. The strange thing is when 
I actually think about Mind Bending Language, it feels like I’m not doing very 
much.  
 
 
In fact a lot of people have asked me, what do you do? I say I just ask a couple 
of questions and you get this little grey area, and when you get there you 
know you’re kind of close. Then you ask them a question and you’re done. 
They’ll go what? 
 
 
Consciously that’s all I’m really paying attention to. It’s a little of emotions – 
what are their physical reactions giving me? It’s a little bit of logic in terms of 
what they’re saying if there are some interesting implications from it or some 
inconsistencies with it.  
 
 
Then every now and again I just throw some Mind Bending Language out 
there. Sometimes honestly it’s just because it amuses me and not because I 
have any great purpose, but then really who am I to know? It’s probably my 
unconscious mind recognizing it’s time to say something. 
 
 
Half the time you think I’m saying something brilliant and I have no idea 
where it came from. The brilliance of it has nothing to do with me. It has to do 
with their reaction. The ones that I thought were going to be brilliant may 
well have missed. 
 
 
It is an ongoing process. We’re not even halfway through the training yet – 
you realize that – but where I would like you to be by the end of this training 
is the point where you’re comfortable and you’re okay with not knowing 
what’s going to happen. That’s really the hardest part to get. 
 
 
If you’re okay with not being great and if you’re okay with not knowing what’s 
going to happen, than you will be great. I learned this one actually from a 
phenomenal theater producer. His name is Keith Johnson.  
 
 
He’s written a little book called Improv, and that little book about 
improvisational theater has more insights about hypnosis and the 
unconscious mind than most of the published clinical works that I’ve ever 
seen, except for Erickson. 
 
 
He really understands how the unconscious mind works. I went to one of his 
workshops. He’s very old now. He is actually a little Erickson in many ways. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
228 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
He’ll sit there and he’ll start talking whist you’re in the middle of doing an 
exercise and not realize he’s talking until bit by bit people stop and start 
paying attention to him. 
 
 
 
Then suddenly you’re riveted. It’s actually very interesting watching him work. 
One of the insights I got from him was this – the problem with improvisation 
or actors basically making skits up as they go along, is they try to be good. 
They’re trying to impress people.  
 
 
They’re trying to be the star – look at me, look at how funny I am, look at how 
clever I am – and in doing so they end up being awful. He has this way of 
saying it. He has these big watery eyes. Maybe it’s because he’s old or maybe 
it’s because he’s emotional. I’m not quite sure which. 
 
 
He’ll sit there and say don’t try to be good, don’t try to be anything, just be 
normal because whatever you think is normal will be fascinating to everyone 
else. And he’s right. Does that answer your question? 
 
Student: Actually something like that happened yesterday for me. I’ve been exposed to 
Mind Bending Language in several different venues and it’s been an area that 
I struggled with, but as I’m trying to build an intellectual framework for where 
to introduce it or where not to or how to approach the questioning, it always 
came off as conscious and awkward. 
 
 
In the exercises yesterday, I completely let go of any idea of using mind 
bending and just focused on the person and the questions and I think the 
effect for many, and certainly for me, was completely different. In there, 
some of the mind spins came through naturally and they fit.  
 
 
It’s been two years for me, but it clicked in a little bit yesterday, so there’s 
hope and I know that he’s refined the process so that it’s much faster now, so 
look out tomorrow. 
 
Igor: 
Listen to him. Tomorrow I may well have him teaching for you. This is true. I 
appreciate the desire to be good at this stuff. It’s impressive and it looks good, 
and people think wow you’re like a wizard, this is fantastic.  
 
 
Let go of it all. Honestly, let go of it all. Focus on the one task you have in front 
of you, which is what kind of questions you’re asking, and even then don’t be 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
229 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
overly concerned if you don’t get it entirely right. Kind of go with the flow 
with it.  
 
 
There are times to get technical and there are times to just let go. Between 
those two boundaries, the technical will sharpen up things but then it will 
break down the actual whole conversation and it will become more awkward. 
So, you’ll become sharper but more awkward.  
 
 
When you let go of it all, you become more natural, more conversational, 
when the real stuff happens and some of that sharpness will erode but it will 
still come through because you’ve improved that element already.  
 
 
By going between those poles, eventually it starts coming together more and 
more. I’m still learning Mind Bending Language. I’m still improving with it. I’m 
still learning hypnotic language in general as well, so there are times when I 
will specifically limit myself in order to polish a particular skill, and there are 
times especially when it counts when I’ll forget about anything that I’m trying 
to do.  
 
 
I’ll just do whatever seems right at that point in time because that seeming 
right bit is my 15 or 20 years of intuitions or probably my lifetime of intuitions 
about people coming through and guiding me down one path or another.  
 
 
It’s not an easy thing to get used to at the beginning because once again you 
have an old program running in the back of your mind. You have to know the 
answer. You have to look good so that you can get an A and not an F. You 
don’t want to fail. You don’t want to be the dunce of the class. You don’t want 
to be embarrassed in front of the other person. 
 
 
You want to feel good enough that you can tell yourself at the end of the day 
yes I did that and that was good. I’ve actually learned more from the things 
that I’ve really totally messed up and I’ve sat back and said what the heck 
happened there? That’s when real thinking occurs. 
 
 
The thinking does not occur when you’re talking to the person. The thinking 
occurs when they’ve left. That’s when you get to analyze things. That’s when 
you get to run it back through your mind.

That’s when you get to mentally rehearse other approaches you could have 
used, or consider theories of maybe when this was going on maybe that was 
going on, but that happens when they’re not there.  
 
 
This is a familiar tagline for those of you who have been to my trainings 
before. When they’re there, the less you think, the better you’ll be. Thanks for 
bringing that up. Are there any other comments or questions? 
 
Student: I don’t know if you addressed this but about those old programs, I would say I 
would be heavily indoctrinated into my system, so I find that automatically it’s 
my default program to indoctrinate others. Man, is it discouraging when I find 
myself in that spot. 
 
Igor: 
By the way, I find myself in that spot too. I’m a human being. I get caught off 
guard. I remember giving people lecture and it was like damn it, I’m better 
than this. It happens, right? It’s an insidious thing. It’s a cultural thing. 
 
 
If your question is how do you deal with that, then the first point is you 
already recognize it. Now I suspect given what you just said that you’ll also 
recognize it in the middle of it. In other words, you’re in the middle of giving 
someone a lecture or an indoctrination program, and you’ll realize there’s 
something wrong with this. It’s not quite right. 
 
 
I will give you my strategy at that point. It’s not that you have to use this. This 
is just an idea but what works for me is that at that point I’ll usually just stop 
talking mid-sentence. Seriously. Why do more damage, right? Then I’ll try to 
do something to figure out what’s going on. Usually I’ll pause it so that it’s not 
too socially awkward. I’ll say let me put it another way, and then I’ll ask a 
question.  
 
 
Let’s put this in a scenario here. Let’s say I’m renting a car and I’m having a 
problem with the person who’s giving me the car. I’m about to give them a big 
lecture, and I’ll stop halfway through because I realize that I’m not getting 
anywhere.  
 
 
So then I’ll say, let me put it another way. I realize that this is your job and you 
have all kinds of things going on right now, and this is one account of many 
and you didn’t necessarily take the booking and so on. I’d like to know if you 
could just check what exactly do you have in the booking form right now?

It may not be a great question but what it’s doing right now is it’s changed the 
complete track. It’s set a new pattern of questioning and response. He’ll say I 
can tell you what it says. No, please just humor me. Look at the form and tell 
me what’s on the form.  
 
 
Then whatever he says, I’m like okay who filled out this form? What does this 
mean? What does that mean? Do you think that the person who filled out this 
form might have made a mistake because if you look at this email and that 
form, they don’t match, do they? He says no. What do you think is going on 
here? 
 
 
Now I’ve completely changed tracks. I’m now back into my questioning 
process. It’s a more mind bending process shall we say, and I’ve segued into 
that because I had – or at least my unconscious mind reminded me that – I 
was running an old program. If you want to carry on with that, I’ll shut up. But 
I’m just reminding you that this is your friendly neighborhood unconscious 
alarm clock saying stop it. Does that help? 
 
Student: It helps a lot and may I just add one quick question? The first day the thing 
that really appealed to me a lot was the grabbing at – there’s nothing there 
from those first questions. I didn’t get that yesterday and I know we’re only in 
day two, so I kind of missed that. 
 
Igor: 
To address that point, you’ll carry on missing that for at least another day. If 
you recall right at the start of yesterday, I told all of you that all the stuff we 
did on the first day with the spinning questions and all that fun stuff, forget 
that for now because we’re building another set of skills. 
 
 
If those mind bending questions or those spinning moments happen to come 
out, so be it, but that is not what we are currently practicing. That is not the 
skill we currently need. We need a separate skill set, which we’ll combine with 
that spinning sensation to make it very powerful. 
 
 
That’s the skill we’re currently learning. These are more intangible skills that 
are more difficult to teach. Hence, I’m sidelining the mind bending stuff, 
which is exciting and it’s like a shiny toy, so it can be distracting.  
 
 
So, we’re sidelining those so that you can get another skill built up, and as 
that skill starts emerging and you start seeing that skill being slow enough,

we’ll reintroduce the other language and then you’ll see what kind of 
powerhouse you’ve been building.  
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. 
 
Student: His question brought up something and I was thinking is there a place for 
indoctrination when you’re speaking to somebody that you want to convey 
certain things and maybe you want to say okay this is what I suggest you do, 
or should it all evolve? 
 
Igor: 
What do you think? 
 
Student: I think I can reframe it such that instead of asking a direct question- get what 
they could do out of them by giving them choices. 
 
Igor: 
I think that’s a nice idea. 
 
Student: I was avoiding a yes. 
 
Igor: 
Sometimes too much certainty is not a good thing. The reason I say that is 
because when we’re certain about something, a door closes and we stop 
looking for better answers.  
 
 
To give you another answer – and I don’t mean to avoid the topic. I just want 
to make sure that you have that train of thought continuing because it is a 
very good question to ask yourself. 
 
 
I view indoctrination and education as a continuum. On the one end you have 
indoctrination. Pure indoctrination is what most school teachers currently 
use. Not all.  
 
 
Some are great educators but many if not most actually just say here’s 
information, here’s more practice, more practice and memorize that because 
it will be on the test.  
 
 
That’s the standard approach. I over-emphasize. I know people spend years 
going to teaching colleges but really that’s what they end up doing. Then you 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
233 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
have a kind of hybrid approach, which is what we use here, where I give some 
facts but then ask some questions.  
 
 
I can ask those questions verbally, I can ask those questions behaviorally, I can 
ask those questions in a context by setting up a certain situation where you’ll 
naturally have to start thinking, or I can go to the pure question route. Allow 
me to indoctrinate you a little bit in my experiences as to what happens with 
those ranges. 
 
 
Pure questions tend to be the most powerful. Whatever people get by 
answering the pure question approach, the pure educational approach, will 
transform them – they get from the inside out. It will be them.  
 
 
They will never forget that. You can never forget something that you have 
developed in an educational process, ever. Memory is not even a question at 
that point.  
 
 
You very quickly forget everything that you’ve been indoctrinated about. 
That’s why it has to be reinforced. There are lots of studies about the way that 
memory degrades over time and how you can reestablish it with periodic 
reviews and so on. That’s why repetition is required for that indoctrination 
process to get into long-term memory. 
 
 
The advantage that indoctrination has – in other words putting information in 
– is it can be faster. It seems faster. It’s a shortcut. The other advantage is 
indoctrination works with any sized group. Whether you’re 100,000, a million, 
a whole nation or a world, people have been fooled like that before. 
 
 
In fact, people are currently being fooled like that. That gives no freedom of 
thought, none. When people say that they’re educating them and teaching 
them how to think, they’re not.  
 
 
They’re teaching them to have their thoughts. The problem with education is 
the larger the group, the harder it is to do because each mind wants to go in 
different directions, and you have to allow that mind to explore that direction, 
and it starts breaking down when there’s one person trying to do it with lots 
of people.  
 
 
Hence, for a group like this, we have a hybrid approach. I’ll use enough of 
indoctrination. I’ll give you enough answers like I’m doing right now to speed 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
234 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
the process up, but then at the crucial points – the bits where it really 
matters, where you really have to have an inner learning – we’ll switch back 
to the education approach. 
 
 
By flipping between the two, we have a faster approach that you still 
internalize. I can’t tell you where on that continuum to sit. That’s why I can’t 
give you a yes. All I can tell you is there is a continuum there and there are 
effects that the ranges will give you, and each context and each situation will 
have the most efficient and effective sweet spot somewhere in that range.  
 
 
You all know indoctrination really well. You’ve had years and years and years 
to perfect it. It’s been engrained into you. So, I don’t spend very much time on 
that. I spend more time on the educational side because that’s the rarer thing, 
but actually my approach is somewhere in between, depending on the nature 
of the information or the knowledge that I need you to have at that point in 
time. 
 
 
Does that give you more of a full answer? Are there any other questions or 
comments? 
 
Student: Would you say that education and indoctrination and inductive learning and 
deductive learning are synonymous? 
 
Igor: 
I wouldn’t say they’re synonymous. They’re synonymous in the way some 
people can see them to be, but they’re not. Actually the pure educational 
process – the questioning process and so on – is a form of deductive 
reasoning. I see where the temptation is to do that but you can’t map them 
one-to-one, so I’d be cautious of that if you’re looking at them on a pure 
logical sense. 
 
 
The way a lot of people talk about deductive learning or inductive learning, 
they closely correlate but if you look at it in terms of a pure logic point of 
view, the educational process – the questioning process – actually engages a 
very deductive mechanism and actually uses induction to create the material 
to be deductive about, so it gets a little complex. 
 
Student: Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any more questions?

Student: I would like to go back to asking questions. I wonder if you’re talking to a 
person who is intentionally lying to you – like what was happening yesterday 
sometimes people were giving answers that would not be completely truthful, 
not because they were lying but they were confused or they didn’t arrive at 
the true answer yet, but sometimes a person will intentionally lie and put a lot 
of energy into hiding the truth. 
 
Igor: 
If your question is how do you detect a lie or an intentional deception, as 
opposed to social masking and all that sort of stuff... 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That goes a little bit beyond the nature of this course and let me explain why. 
You can tell a liar. Actually I was talking to one of our trainers about this the 
other day.  
 
 
The way to spot a liar is a complex mix, which is a whole different set of skills 
where you have to read body language, signals of stress, soothing gestures 
and so on, combined with logical inconsistencies in what they’re doing, 
combined with some surprising things that Mind Bending Language can help 
with to get a slightly genuine response, which will then conflict with 
information they’ve given before, which then has been triggered – or at least 
is giving you a hint – by a cluster of nonverbal responses that then have to be 
tested because you don’t know if that’s a question of confusion or actually a 
direct lie. 
 
 
It gets very involved. People who are good at this spend years perfecting that 
sort of thing, and it’s really not something that we can cover here. It just goes 
beyond the scope of what we’re doing here. Yes, it is a fascinating field. The 
simple answer is the way you catch a liar is you get them to elaborate on their 
truth, so to speak.  
 
 
They have to invent it and at some point there will be an inconsistency, and 
when you focus on that inconsistency it starts to fall apart. The 
inconsistencies when someone is actually just confused versus actually lying 
have a different quality to them. That’s the best I can give you at this point. 
 
Student: Just to follow up on Joanne’s question and Tayo’s comment as well, the 
strategy to communicate in between the guru mood and question type – does 
that apply to teenagers?

Igor: 
Absolutely. In fact, either tomorrow or the day after, I’m going to go through 
different scenarios where the skills you’re learning here I’ll demonstrate how 
you might use in different scenarios.  
 
 
The kind of scenarios I’m thinking about are parenting a teenager because 
that’s interesting, or teaching someone something whether you’re an 
educator or a boss trying to create a skill set in the office, giving someone a 
performance review or a sales situation, so I can give you a whole context on 
how to apply this stuff in a sales situation, and if you have actual scenarios 
that you want to think about as well like… 
 
Student: A spouse. 
 
Igor: 
Very comparable. That’s not going to be of interest to anyone, is it? We’ll be 
actually going through scenarios tomorrow or the day after. You still need 
some more building blocks before we can start handling that.  
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Freestyle MBL & Probing Questions 
 
Igor: 
We spent the first day just spinning around with crazy language just to kind of 
have fun with it. You had your heads turned inside out. Some of you enjoyed 
it and some of you started learning to enjoy it.  
 
 
Then yesterday we paused all that and instead we got very curious and 
interested about people’s thinking styles or thought processes and developed 
a method of getting inside someone’s mind to kind of find out what’s inside it, 
get more clarity and a little more sense of what’s going on, but we focused on 
individual aspects.  
 
 
These are the kinds of probing questions we had: 
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context frames & POV 
3. Driving Qs & Answers 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
237 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 Motivation. 
 Purpose. 
 Context. 
 Frames. 
 Points of view. 
 What kinds of questions they ask themselves. 
 What kinds of answers they found. 
 What kinds of questions did they stop asking themselves when they 
found a good enough answer. 
 
What I’d like to do now is in a moment you’ll find a partner and I want you to 
take seven or eight minutes apiece to – maybe we’ll stick with the Mind 
Bending Language thing – to go through these kinds of questions but totally 
freestyle now.  
 
In other words, you don’t have to conform to any of these questions. You 
don’t have to assess their thoughts in this way. The only thing I want you to 
focus on is: 
 
 
1. How natural is the conversation that you’re having. 
 
2. Can you follow up on anything they say that is of interest to you, that 
makes you curious about it? 
 
3. Pay attention to what layer of the layer cake you’re at. Are you at a 
total glib conscious level, or can you kind of drop lower on that layer 
cake?  
 
I don’t care how you do that, by the way. The only thing I do care about is that 
you don’t plan it. You’re only allowed to decide what your next question will 
be after they’ve finished talking and you’ve observed them. Then you say 
okay, good.  
 
Now if whilst they’re talking you get inspired with a question that fits what 
they happen to be talking about, by all means feel free to pause them and say 
let me just pause you a second. You just said something interesting there. Let 
me just follow up on that.  
 
That’s fine because you’re observing them then. The only thing to avoid is if 
you ask a question like what’s Mind Bending Language to you, and then 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
238 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
furiously you’re like Wittgenstein – what’s the next question, what’s the next 
question, what’s the next question? Okay, stop talking. I have a question. 
 
There are varying degrees of the Wittgenstein response, although I’m doing a 
great man a great disservice, so hopefully you realize it’s tongue-in-cheek. 
There are varying degrees of that. As long as you can avoid that, pretty much 
anything else goes. Do you understand the nature of the exercise? 
 
Student: Can we ask any question? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, there are no constraints whatsoever. You’re just going to have a regular 
conversation. Your only object is to find out how deep into the layer cake can 
you drop and how conversational and how natural can you be?  
 
 
The only constrain you have is you may not plan anything, except possibly the 
first question, which I’ll give to you right now – what do you think Mind 
Bending Language is all about? To be honest with you, you don’t even have to 
use that one. That’s just to get the ball rolling.  
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
So, how did that go for you guys? Stand up and we’ll get a mic to you. Go 
ahead. 
 
Student: I was going to say the amazing part of that exercise for me was that even 
without focusing on the whole hypnotic response and the Mind Bending 
Language, just how much watching my partner and watching him just light up 
and be fascinated and the amazing things he was saying, how much it just 
helped me without the hypnotic context to it.  
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. In fact, this is the key right there. They are the roadmap. If you 
want to have a little map on how to get from A to B, watch them. They’re the 
roadmap. Their reactions tell you. So, that’s perfect. Thank you. Go ahead. 
 
Student: We were having a conversation and we started off with a question and it 
quickly morphed into something else, which was completely fascinating. As 
Cassie said, his face lit up. He got engaged.

We were sharing. I was having a good idea of what was driving him, what his 
goals were and it was quite different from the initial question. We were just 
having a conversation actually. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, but you’re having a different kind of conversation. 
 
Student: And in the middle of it, there was something that said put in a spin. The spin 
was not probably the best, but I put in one or two and I think he got where I 
was coming from. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. By the way, do you know what the old-fashioned term for a 
hypnotic trance used to be? Hypnotic fascination. You’re beginning to get an 
insight into using hypnosis covertly. Go ahead. 
 
Student: It was a really fantastic experience and I had a really great partner to work 
with. I could see that we both went on it without any preconceived ideas of 
where we were going to go and just followed the moments, and I had the 
opportunity I think of sending him off into thinking a few times but I ended up 
stuck in a loop.  
 
Igor: 
What kind of loop was that? 
 
Student: It kept going back to the same question with the same answer, and it kind of 
would pop back up onto the intellectual level. 
 
Igor: 
So, if you were to do that again and you found the same loop occurring – a 
loop’s not a problem of course – what would you do differently the next time? 
 
Student: Well, I think I’d like to try to come up with some deeply poignant brilliant 
spinning question but I didn’t. 
 
Igor: 
What else would you do? In fact, let me ask the question a different way. 
What is the smallest thing you could do differently that might get you a 
different result? 
 
Student: Pause. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: Take a breath.

Igor: 
I agree. Did you notice the difference in the responses to the two questions? 
If you don’t mind me talking about why you got stuck, the reason you got 
stuck is when you noticed you got stuck you tried to be good. You tried to get 
your first resolution, which was to come up with some clever poignant thing. 
That’s why you got stuck. 
 
 
Your second solution seemed so much more trivial, and I would put money on 
it that that would get you exactly where you wanted to go. All you forgot was 
to have a conversation. 
 
Student: Right. Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. It’s a very useful thing to learn. I get into those loops 
constantly. The difference is once I’ve been in it long enough I remind myself 
that it’s okay to be stupid from time to time. You all think that I’m having this 
clever pause. No, I’m just resting myself. Igor, just be dense for a bit. Just ask 
the really stupid question you want to ask and just get on with it. 
 
Student: I think this is a very basic thing, but a lot of times we are not listened to, and 
part of this is when somebody is actually paying attention to you, it’s like oh 
they’re listening, they’re really listening, and there’s a trust and the wall starts 
to go down.  
 
 
If someone is framing a question, they’re not really listening. So, when they 
do, you sense it instinctively that they care enough to focus on me, so it builds 
an automatic trust I think. 
 
Igor: 
And while you think it’s very basic, you’ve just described that, and there’s a 
reason I call it the keys. Excellent. Thank you. Are there any other insights, 
realizations or questions? 
 
Student: Could we have Johnny give us a whistle lesson? 
 
Igor: 
It’s funny you should talk about that. We just talked about the same thing 
earlier on. If you guys want and if we’ve got some time at some point in the 
course, we’ll take 10 minutes and see if he can do that. He’s good, isn’t he? 
Give him a round of applause.

Student: My husband and I – he’s been here most of this – but we have a very different 
way of communicating that almost seems to be the core of what Mind 
Bending Language is anyway, in that it’s complete focused attention on the 
other person.  
 
 
While I thought he would get a lot out of being here, he was really 
questioning why people aren’t doing a lot of this pausing and totally focusing 
on the other person a lot more during normal conversations. Is it just that 
we’re weird because we do tend to get along better than most? It seems to 
be that when you do that, you have such a richer experience of every 
conversation. 
 
Igor: 
I agree 100% with you. So, instead of questioning yourselves as to whether 
you’re “good enough,” I would stand up with pride and realize you’re doing 
something that most people have to still learn how to do. You’re actually 
learning the rocket fuel that makes all this stuff work.  
 
 
Yes, we’ll come back to Mind Bending Language and the clever language tricks 
and stuff you can do with it, and yes we’ll introduce a nice little schema that 
you can be very influential with in all kinds of different contexts. You guys just 
happen to be ahead of the game. 
 
 
If you’re doing all this stuff already, that frees you up tremendously to focus 
more on the technical aspects of the questions and so on. Unfortunately – 
again I think this is a social thing because we get socialized on how we interact 
with people and so on – most people don’t have that skill set. 
 
 
I didn’t have that skill set that you’re talking about right now. It took me 
many, many years of practice and so on to get there. As you all know, that 
informed the idea of the H+ and so on. I got it from some great hypnotists, 
people like Milton Erickson.  
 
 
So, if you’re telling me that that’s your natural style already, I take my hat off 
to you. You’re already in the same league, the same category as people like 
Milton Erickson are. That’s a phenomenal place to be.  
 
 
You may doubt me, but he’s still a human being and he still has the same 
thing. The things that drive, the things that really make this stuff work, you’ve 
talked about and that’s exactly the right stuff.

The only thing you might be missing and the payoff you’ll get out of this are 
more of the technical aspects – what kind of questions to ask, where do they 
lead you, strategies about those things, what kind of language to put into it 
and so on. 
 
 
I have to balance it out because most people don’t have what you have 
already. Hence, it seems so obvious to you. There’s a man called Moshé 
Feldenkrais who came up with the Feldenkrais method. Have you heard of 
him?  
 
 
He was a great man and he wrote a book, and the title of this book alone is 
genius. It’s called The Elusive Obvious. What you guys are doing is the elusive 
obvious. This is obvious, isn’t it? Let me put it this way.  
 
 
All this stuff really is obvious once you hear it, isn’t it? But we don’t do it on a 
day-to-day basis and that’s why it’s been elusive. It’s eluded us in some ways. 
So, I’m very glad you’re doing it. Keep going. This seems to have opened the 
questioning door again. 
 
Student: I have a reflection on one of the things that is very significant to me, which is 
this phrase that you repeat a few times, and that is let me put it another way. 
So, when I think about my style of communicating in the past – maybe from 
now on I can change – but I didn’t have any other way to put it. If I were to 
just adapt that and say okay now I think we’re not understanding each other, 
let me put it another way, then after I say that I’ve got nothing else to say. I 
didn’t have any other ways. So, right now I think I have developed some of 
these other ways, which may or may not become part of me, but if it becomes 
part of me, that’s what I want to do. 
 
Igor: 
I think that’s a tremendous insight you just made there. When you put 
yourself out there like that, when you say let me put it another way – you may 
notice that I’m doing something right now and actually I’m not faking this. 
This is actually the way it happens generally. 
 
 
Usually I say that just before I have to stop and really think furiously about 
what it is I’m going to say another way because when you take the social risk 
of saying let me put it another way to you, you’ve basically just asked yourself 
a question, which means you’ve started thinking again, which means that 
amazing piece of matter between your ears is going to start doing some work 
and amazing things come out of that.

Initially because it’s new, it’s like let me put it another way [long pause]. 
That’s okay by the way. It goes back to the power of pausing. You may notice 
that I pause a lot, sometimes just to let them have an experience because 
that’s very important, and sometimes to let me have an experience because 
otherwise how on Earth will I know how to put it another way? I commend 
that. That’s a tremendous insight and a thing to reflect on. That’s a great thing 
to challenge yourself with. There’s a question over there. 
 
Student: It’s just a comment on that. I think that when we look at it, everybody in here 
basically when you set us up with somebody new, they’re strangers but the 
way that this system – just what you said this morning – it didn’t matter, but 
the basics of the non-judgment allows people to become intimate in ways 
that they will reveal things that actually is what they want to change but can’t 
actually say it to most people. Even with a therapist they can’t. 
 
 
By letting it be so almost casual but we’re still in charge by being conscious of 
it all, that intimacy can lead to that outcome that they’re looking for and they 
wonder how did that happen but I’m glad it did. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. You said a very important word right there, and that word is casual. If 
you read Erickson, he comes up with this a lot. His most important 
suggestions are usually presented very casually and then he goes onto other 
stuff. That’s part of the distraction method in many ways. 
 
 
Why do you think that is? What is the importance of keeping things casual 
even when you get into a very deep conversation? What do you think? It 
stops resistance. Why do you think it might stop people being as resistant if 
you’re keeping it casual? Hands up. 
 
Student: I’d say if you want it casual, you risk triggering the critical factor again. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. It actually goes a little bit beyond that as well, and that’s actually a huge 
thing right there.  
 
Student: Just people feel safe. 
 
Igor: 
People will feel safe because they don’t think you’re up to something, right? 
There’s one more thing I’m looking for as well – and that’s just because I’m 
looking for it.

Student: I believe when we stop resistance, things happen naturally and also one thing 
I would comment on is… 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you here a second because you just hit the nail on the head? 
What is he saying when he says things happen naturally? Who does things 
naturally – the conscious mind or the unconscious mind? By keeping it casual, 
do you think I’d be justified in suggesting that it might be more likely that we 
get an unconscious response? Isn’t that what we want as hypnotists? So, you 
hit the nail right on the head. Carry on with the other half. 
 
Student: One more comment – as I was talking to my partner, I noticed if you count the 
moment as the most important thing that’s happening right now and mindful 
of the noise and there you go. You hit the magical moment. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. I’m glad to hear you saying this because it’s really the same thing that 
you were saying over here. If you did nothing but all the clunky versions of 
Mind Bending Language and added this element – this intangible element 
shall we say – you’ll go further than most hypnotists I know of, just with those 
two things. 
 
 
Of course there are ways to improve it. What these things do is for example 
let you target where to go with it more to know what you’re trying to fix and 
get into that a little bit more clearly, be more precise with what you’re doing, 
be faster but more effective, but if all you do when you leave here is keep 
these things in mind, if you do that in every conversation you want to be 
influential in and from time to time you throw some of these things here in, 
you will be more influential than most people out there. 
 
 
Thank you for that. Norman has been very patient, so stand up and grab the 
mic. 
 
Norman: I was just wanting to comment that often learning something new is difficult 
unless we have an application in which to apply it to. So in the Ben Winter’s 
situation of not knowing what’s another way of to say it, is that not an ideal 
opportunity to practice using the Master Class No. 8, the Power States 
exercise?

Igor: 
Absolutely, it will fit in perfectly and there will be many more ways as well. 
Why would I want to limit him to one particular other way? I think it’s a very 
fruitful one. He just needs to do some thinking first.  
 
 
Let me put it to you another way – here’s a story. Let me put it another way – 
a Non-Awareness Set. Let me put it another way – forget about it. Thank you 
for that. Are we all good with the comments? No more questions? 
  
Adding MBL Spins 
 
Igor: 
The thing I’d like to do before we have another break is we’re going to do one 
more quick exercise. This exercise is kind of like jumping into a cold pool, and 
the reason for it is just to understand a contrast. I would really like you to get 
a contrast of something.  
 
 
What you did a moment ago is excellent. It’s exactly what we’re looking for. 
What we’re going to do now is have a shorter conversation, just two minutes 
apiece. You’re going to start off exactly the same way. There’s no particular 
direction you need to go.  
 
 
Get a new partner. You have to go in no particular direction with it. You’re 
just going to ask whatever questions are curious to you. Of course keep the 
keys in mind. At some point in that conversation, at any point that you feel 
like in that conversation, I’d like for you to go back to one of these mechanical 
spins.  
 
 
Just throw in there without any rhyme or reason. You don’t have to try to 
make it smooth, glib or socially appropriate. Just throw it in there just to see 
what happens. There are two things you’re observing when you do this: 
 
 
1. You want to observe their reaction. 
2. You want to observe your reaction. 
 
As soon as you’ve done that, you can carry on in your normal conversation for 
until the two minutes are up. If you wish to, you can take the Ben Winter’s 
strategy of apologizing when you’ve said your spins and say let me put it 
another way, and then go back to regular socially responsive questions.

Do you understand the nature of the exercise? It will be a little shorter. You’ll 
start off with your normal stuff. Of course you’ll still do all of these things here 
– the nonverbal emotionally appropriate things.  
 
You’ll be asking whatever questions come to mind. It’s still questions-based, 
but at some point you’re going to just jump into a hard line Mind Bending 
Language spin.  
 
You can make it as convoluted as you like, just purely for the purpose of 
experiencing both their reaction and your reaction, and then finding some 
way to smooth things over again so that you can get back to a socially 
responsive conversation. Do you understand the nature of the exercise?  
 
How was that? It was a little different from the last exercise, wasn’t it? Please 
share some of your experiences because it will be interesting to contrast the 
two. Stand up so we can get a mic to you. 
 
Student: What I’m noticing is a theme here that perhaps we’ve all been doing quite of 
bit of this already. 
 
Igor: 
Is anyone else noticing that you’ve been doing more Mind Bending Language 
than you realized?  
 
Student: That was the best two minutes so far. We just were going blah, blah, blah and 
all the sudden chung, chung, and it just went on and on. It was just fantastic. I 
just loved it. 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this. How did you do that? 
 
Student: We were just asking questions, interested in each other, and then we threw in 
some of that language. 
 
Igor: 
Without having to plan it, without straining. 
 
Student: Nothing like that. 
 
Igor: 
So, I guess you know a little more than you realized.  
 
Student: I think I do.

Igor: 
Go ahead. 
 
Student: The best part is I cannot remember the question I asked her and I don’t need 
to remember it. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Welcome to my world. Stand up and we’ll get a mic to you. 
 
Student: I found it very interesting as Tayo and I were having a conversation, she threw 
the Mind Bending Language question in and I got completely lost, and then 
she went on with the normal question and I kept going back to that mind 
bending question and I wanted to answer this question through this frame. I 
couldn’t get out of this side loop that she took me. 
 
Igor: 
If I understand you correctly, what you’re saying is that once you had that spin 
thrown in and your mind’s going through a loop and then you go back to a 
regular conversation, your mind’s still obsessing about the old spin and 
everything you’re answering from that point forward is still changed or 
transformed influence by the original spin, whether or not you managed to 
answer it. Is that right? 
 
Student: Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful, an excellent result.  
 
Student: As we keep going through these little skits and the processes here, I realize 
that this is how I usually talk to so many people and they just say stop 
analyzing me. 
 
Igor: 
Right. The reason about the analyzing stuff is if you’re not doing enough of – 
it’s just to do with that. If you go too much to the FBI interview, it seems like 
analysis.  
 
 
If you have more of a sense of curiosity or a little bit of flattery thrown in 
there as well, these are the social cues that say I’m not messing with you. I 
actually appreciate you as a person and please continue. I’m really fascinated 
about how you think and what your actual opinion is. That takes it out of the 
FBI interview frame. It’s a good thing to realize. You may just have to soften 
your style somewhat and then you’ll have the real impact kicking in.

Student: Kind of an interesting thing happened. I was working with Jules and we were 
talking, and I just kind of strung a bunch of stuff together. I had no idea where 
I was going or anything. He spun out but I spun out too and I came back with a 
question that seemed to be really relevant to him. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. This is important. This is going back to the principle of going first. 
How could you even have the arrogance to presume the other person has to 
have their mind go spinning around to crazy places unless you were to join 
them?  
 
 
One of the skills you’re learning here and specifically in the Advanced Covert 
Hypnosis set, with all the exercises we did today we did a lot more spinning 
exercises there than here – is to get you comfortable with the idea of going on 
these little inner space journeys because when you can do that, then you can 
join them and you get the benefit too.  
 
 
The quality of your questions improve and even though we haven’t got that 
many questions we’ve been asking yet – or at least that many themes that 
we’ve been focusing on – isn’t some great stuff already coming out now? Who 
here feels that already they’re communicating more powerfully and more 
influentially than before they came here? That’s excellent. 
 
Student: I wish I could have witnessed some of the wonderful conversations with 
spinning going on, which other people commented on. For me, both as the 
hypnotist and the hypnotee it did not work very well. 
 
Igor: 
So, what actually happened? 
 
Student: What actually happened – maybe I can say what the insight was because it 
was very useful. I tried too hard. I totally clunkily overdid it, so I was in a great 
conversation, having fun, and wanted to go actually more on the route we 
were pursuing but then the two minutes were nearly over, so I just threw in a 
really long mind bending thing putting everything in and it just didn’t work. 
 
Igor: 
What do you mean it just didn’t work? Did the person die in front of you? 
 
Student: No, it didn’t work or at least it felt very awkward. 
 
Igor: 
So, it felt awkward for you but what was the impact for them? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
249 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: I think it felt awkward to them. Would you like to comment on that? 
 
Student: It was actually an interesting place. 
 
Igor: 
He said it was an interesting place. So, he enjoyed it but you didn’t. What is 
the lesson here? 
 
Student: Never, ever assume. 
 
Igor: 
In fact, you’re going onto the exercise that we’re going to do in the next step. 
It’s true. It’s a very valuable lesson by the way. May I give you some ideas as 
to why you felt awkward? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The awkwardness came more because you broke your own state of mind. You 
were in a particular train of thought, in a particular train of mind, a state of 
consciousness.  
 
 
You jumped dramatically to another state of consciousness to be able to come 
up with that question, and that shift felt like there was a cognitive dissonance 
inside you. That’s where the awkwardness came from. 
 
 
The question itself may also be socially awkward, but because he enjoyed the 
conversation enough, he gave you enough leeway to take it seriously and 
enjoyed it. You’re right. In some contexts, they might find that awkward too if 
you jump in too harshly. 
 
 
The only lesson I would encourage you to take from this is more a question of 
how can you ask a similarly spinful question if you need to, but introduce it in 
a way that’s soft enough for you to feel comfortable so that you have the 
same effect without having to radically alter your state, given that you’re 
already in a good state? Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, absolutely. 
 
Student: I had the exact contrast to that because my partner went to this question and 
there were these pregnant pauses. I thought she’s amazing. These pauses are 
freaking me out. What the heck is she going to come up with now? I was 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
250 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
absolutely ecstatic with that. Then I did get spun out and it just worked real 
classically. I just went with her. 
 
Igor: 
What you discovered is again one of the important keys here. Let me share a 
very funny example of this. I did a private mentoring program for Mind 
Bending Language for hypnotherapy for our trainers. We were doing different 
exercises and focusing on therapy.  
 
 
This course is more for influence but these keys are still of course prevalent 
throughout. We were emphasizing things like pauses and so on, and at one 
point in one of the exercises that we did to work through a problem because 
it was hypnotherapeutic, and the entire mind bending conversation had 
basically four or five words in it. Would you like to see what it went like? 
 
 
So, the therapist says what’s the problem? The client says I’d like to take more 
time to make products. So, the therapist sits there and absorbs it. He says, so 
take time and make products. The client is listening to him thinking when are 
the spins going to come? Is the spin going to come? He’s just looking at me. 
Why is he just looking at me? Boom! That was the entire conversation. 
 
 
He said it was deeper than he’s been in a long, long time because the mind 
bending moment didn’t come from the language; it came from the total break 
and waiting for it and waiting for it, and suddenly realizing this was it and then 
reanalyzing the suggestion – take time to make products – at a totally 
different level, and he literally almost fell off his chair. 
 
 
Are you beginning to appreciate the power of pausing? It sounds like a silly 
thing. One of the biggest mistakes people make in this work is trying to rush. 
So, congratulations! It’s a huge insight. 
 
Student: One of the things I find myself falling into frequently is making spins that are a 
little bit too long, too spinny, too many words, too many of the chains on 
there.  
 
 
What I’d like to get better at is just the tiniest spins possible and start with a 
very small one and maybe add to it another little bit of spin, and then another 
little bit of spin, because in a sense the pause is a spin because it forces 
somebody to step out of their usual frame, and this is all about getting 
somebody to step out of their normal little frame of consciousness.

So, if we could practice starting with the minimal instead of these big long 
things we did on the first day, it would be helpful for me. 
 
Igor: 
A couple of things – number one, we will come to that particular exercise. We 
will actually address that particular thing in an exercise. I have a question for 
you however, and that is if you were to do this exercise again in light of what 
you have just said – which I think is a very wise insight – how much more 
would you do differently than all the things you’ve done so far to make it 
somehow better? Thank you. Would you like to answer that? You don’t have 
to because it seems like something important just happened. 
 
Student: I tend to be a feeling processing person and it takes me a long time to come 
up with the answers. I don’t find them quickly. I might come up with the 
answer tomorrow. 
 
Igor: 
I don’t need a verbal answer. All I want to acknowledge… 
 
Student: Let me know later what it is I gave you. 
 
Igor: 
All I want to acknowledge is the fact that something important happened 
there, right? 
 
Student: I’m not sure. 
 
Igor: 
Tell me tomorrow if that’s okay. I can wait.  
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Just keep whatever just happened in mind the next time we do an 
exercise like this – or not. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. Thank you. 
 
Student: Thank you. We’re not even halfway through the course, but I already am 
100% confident that I’ve learned a new tool to put in my toolbox that will 
change my life.  
 
Igor: 
That’s fantastic. Give him a round of applause for that. Thank you for that.

Student: And I even have a name for it. 
 
Igor: 
What’s that? 
 
Student: Taser tongue.

DVD 8 – The 3 Big Questions Of Influence & 
How They Radically Shift A Person’s View 
 
 
Expanding Probing Questions 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How are you doing? Does anyone here feel like they’ve 
learned a thing or two of late? Now that we’ve had a chance to play with 
these ideas and kind of go freestyle with it, it’s time to get back to some 
constraints again just so we can start expanding our probing vocabulary, our 
probing questions. 
 
 
The kind of questions I want to work with now should be relatively easy 
because this is the kind of stuff that people usually talk about. It’s probing 
about: 
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
 
 What questions they have. 
 What assumptions they’ve made – which is why I really like the 
question you had earlier on. 
 What opinions they have. 
 What thoughts they have about these things. 
 
This is really where most of us spend our time when we have conversations – 
why do you think that? Oh, that’s interesting. What do you think about this? 
Can I have a volunteer just to do a simple demo on that? Come on up. Give 
him a round of applause. Have a seat over here.

Demo: Deeper Probing Questions 
 
Igor: 
How are you doing, Mike? 
 
Mike: 
I’m good. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. You’ve been doing a lot of Mind Bending Language stuff over the 
last few days, some of it more overtly mind bending and some things are 
tangentally related to it. The one thing I don’t know yet is what is it that is 
important to you about Mind Bending Language? How come you came to this 
course? 
 
Mike: 
I came to this course because after studying the other Mind Bending 
Language courses, there just seemed to be something missing that made it 
more practical, something beyond just the clunky language patterns. So, I 
came here to find that piece. 
 
Igor: 
Just tell me a little more about the clunky language patterns. How do you 
know that they’re clunky? 
 
Mike: 
Because they feel clunky. 
 
Igor: 
They just feel clunky, right? 
 
Mike: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, and what specifically are you thinking about in terms of those language 
patterns? Can you give me an example of that? 
 
Mike: 
It’s the whole ‘who are you not when anytime but now’ kind of stuff and the 
way it fits within a context. 
 
Igor: 
How have you used those in the past? 
 
Mike: 
Well, I’ve used them more as a distraction or confusion technique because I 
didn’t really understand the purpose of them. 
 
Igor: 
Tell me a little bit more about that – this distraction or confusion technique. 
 
Mike: 
In what way? As an example? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
255 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
How do you use Mind Bending Language as a confusion technique? In other 
words, you had an idea how to apply them, so I’m just curious about what 
that application was. 
 
Mike: 
I would be talking to a client or a student and they’d be going down on a 
particular train of thought, which we had already talked about as being the 
normal pattern that they normally run. So, I would use it more as a pattern 
interrupt to get them off of that train of thought and then redirect them to 
someplace else. 
 
Igor: 
How come you decided to use Mind Bending Language for that? 
 
Mike: 
Because it seemed effective as a way of derailing a thought process. 
 
Igor: 
What do you think Mind Bending Language is about? 
 
Mike: 
What I think now – which is much different than I thought before – was not as 
a distraction technique or a confusion technique, but as a way to get us out of 
the auto response mode and, as you say, into more genuine thinking to be 
able to access resources that we had there all along but because we’re in this 
auto response we can’t see them anymore.  
 
Igor: 
And how does that work? How does Mind Bending Language let that happen? 
 
Mike: 
As a pattern interrupt still, but in a way that redirects thinking more toward 
alternative resources. So, instead of running the same pattern over and over 
again, now we’re looking for new pathways. 
 
Igor: 
All right, and what kind of words, what kind of language is actually included in 
Mind Bending Language and what kind of language isn’t? 
 
Mike: 
It’s more questioning language or probing type language. 
 
Igor: 
So, if you ask a probing question, you’re doing Mind Bending Language. Is that 
what you’re saying? 
 
Mike: 
Yes, that’s part of it. I’m sure there are other aspects of it as well. What I’ve 
learned this weekend is that the questions are really the key aspect of making 
it effective. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
256 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
And what are the other aspects that you mentioned? 
 
Mike: 
The other aspects are creating distance or closeness – distancing yourself 
from a problem or getting someone closer to a solution by using the spatial 
words or proximity words or things like that. 
 
Igor: 
What is there? 
 
Mike: 
That’s a good question. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s take a little timeout here. So far this looks like a regular conversation, 
doesn’t it? That’s because, as I warned you, this stuff is the stuff that we’re 
most used to dealing with.  
 
 
We’re dealing with concepts, ideas, thoughts, etc. So, we’re very comfortable 
answering those kind of questions as opposed to things more about 
motivation and stuff like that. Hence, I’ve kept away from it a little bit. 
 
 
However, we still need to know these things because if I don’t know what 
ideas are running around inside his mind, I don’t know how they’ve been 
applied or misapplied.  
 
 
Already his mind has changed in terms of what Mind Bending Language was, 
and the only bits where you’re more likely to get mind bending shall we say is 
when you start getting to the edges of that knowledge. 
 
 
Remember, what we’re looking for are: concepts, assumptions, opinions, 
thoughts and so on. It’s really how he conceives of, how he thinks about 
whatever topic is at hand. If we get close to that edge, it gets a little more 
mind bending, which is kind of where we just got to. Did you see that? 
 
 
It took us a while to get there because he’s quite knowledgeable about the 
field, which means the essential stuff has been mapped out for him already, 
so getting to that edge is going to take a little bit more time. Of course, if this 
was some kind of an influential conversation I was having, I may not spend 
that much time on these steps. Just enough to realize where is he? Does he 
have some strange assumptions about Mind Bending Language or some 
strange ideas about it that may be interfering with it?

257 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
For example, had I had this conversation with him before this seminar, it 
would have come out very quickly – this idea that he used it to distract people 
or as a pattern interrupt and that’s pretty much it, right?  
 
 
At that point I’d say great, now I understand what assumptions he has and 
how he conceives of, or how he thinks about or what ideas he has about Mind 
Bending Language, and I’d know how to expand him on that. 
 
 
Right now of course he’s got a lot more going for him, so getting to that edge 
is going to take a little longer. I apologize for the interruption but we were left 
on a very interesting question and I suspect you were thinking about that a 
little bit. 
 
Mike: 
Yes. So, what more is there to Mind Bending Language? It’s hard to put into 
words because it becomes more of a gut feeling and in the connections that 
you make with someone else while you’re engaged in that type of 
conversation. 
 
Igor: 
Can you say a little bit more about that?  
 
Mike: 
Probably not. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s take a quick timeout. You can think as I carry on with this. Again, notice 
that because we’re at the edge now, I’m getting less verbal responses. Now 
I’m still putting pressure on him but I’m not putting the pressure on him to 
get an actual answer because that could force him the wrong way. Do you 
want to see what I mean by that? I’m going to do the wrong thing for a 
moment. I apologize to you in advance. 
 
Mike: 
Sure, no problem. 
 
Igor: 
This is just to contrast what I’m talking about. So, you were just thinking about 
something. What was that? Just really think about it. What was that? 
 
Mike: 
Well, it’s the feeling that you get while you’re in the middle of that type of 
conversation of a connection that’s happening between your subconscious 
mind and the subject’s subconscious mind. 
 
Igor: 
I sense there’s more to that. Really think about it. Come on. So, I’m putting a 
little bit of the right kind of pressure on there, right? So, I am getting verbal 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

responses because he’s had a chance to think about it, but there’s only so 
much I can do of that before this hand turns into a fist, but we don’t want him 
to get off that topic because clearly important things are happening. 
 
 
So, let’s go back to these keys and see if we can use some of these keys to 
help keep the pressure on in the right way. Clearly you have some thoughts 
about what that gut feeling tells you about, and I know right now it’s difficult 
to put into words but I really want you to consider that. Even if it’s just like 
flashes or even if you’re going to say it the wrong way, what are the kinds of 
things that are going through your mind as you’re thinking about that? 
 
Mike: 
Some of the things going through my mind are… 
 
Igor: 
Do you notice the difference in the response, by the way? There’s a sigh. He’s 
looking off into the distance while he’s talking about things. I’m about to get a 
better quality answer. The last answer was just really repeating the previous 
answer, wasn’t it?  
 
 
I don’t know this for a fact but I suspect I’m very likely to get a different 
quality of response. I apologize for interrupting on that. So, what was it you 
were about to say? 
 
Mike: 
What I was about to say is that the feeling that I get when the conversation is 
flowing naturally is that the responses are more genuine and the questions 
are more genuine. 
 
Igor: 
How does this relate to Mind Bending Language? 
 
Mike: 
It relates in the way that it demonstrates the effectiveness of Mind Bending 
Language in triggering access to resources that are helpful and not limiting. 
 
Igor: 
How do you know that Mind Bending Language as a topic is actually achieving 
this? 
 
Mike: 
Just through experience, I guess. Just what we’ve experienced here and the 
exercises that we do, utilizing it in that context and how much more effective 
it becomes.

Igor: 
So, if you were to compare what you mean by Mind Bending Language now as 
opposed to before you came here, could you give me some contrast between 
what you thought it was and what you think it is now? 
 
Mike: 
Sure. I used to think it was just a way of confusing people as an overload 
mechanism, sort of a verbal shock induction, and then once you’ve spiked the 
amygdala, you go off in a different direction and try to get your suggestion in. 
I still think it has that effect. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. 
 
Mike: 
But it’s even more effective when the way that you create that effect is done 
in a context that is geared toward power resources as opposed to just 
confusion. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, and what would you say Mind Bending Language is not? 
 
Mike: 
I think it is not just a confusion technique, although if it’s used improperly 
then that’s really all it is. 
 
Igor: 
Of course, and what else is it not? Just really think about it because it’s 
actually an interesting question, isn’t it? 
 
Mike: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What else is it not? 
 
Mike: 
It’s not the typical auto response question and answer type of interaction. 
 
Igor: 
And how in your mind would you separate the two – the auto response type 
question versus the Mind Bending Language type question? How do you know 
the difference? 
 
Mike: 
One is kind of a rigid interview type process where you just have basic 
questions and you’re expecting specific answers on both sides of the table. 
We’ve all had standard questions asked to us and we have in our mind a 
standard response that we get, whereas Mind Bending Language goes beyond 
that to delve in even deeper to get more unconscious feeling responses.

Igor: 
Based on that, what do you think someone would need to know in order to be 
able to do Mind Bending Language? Consider that for a second. I’ll just talk 
elsewhere.  
 
 
Did you notice that we’re coming up with the same probes from different 
directions – through negation a little bit, through what’s beyond that and little 
miniature spins – to continue to change his context and point of view to get a 
richer picture of what’s going on? Go ahead. 
 
Mike: 
Sure. Your question was… 
 
Igor: 
What would someone else need to know in order to be able to use Mind 
Bending Language in the way that we’ve been talking about? 
 
Mike: 
I feel what they would need to know is that the questions they ask themselves 
are more important than the questions that they’re asking the other person. 
 
Igor: 
That’s an interesting idea. What kind of questions do you mean? Can you give 
me a comparison? 
 
Mike: 
A lot of it stems from the whole concept of H+ and having the right intent. So, 
instead of just asking questions to try to get a reaction out of someone, you’re 
really asking yourself what state do I need to be in, in order to access the 
resource that’s going to give me the appropriate question at the time that I 
need it that’s going to help my subject or my client to access the resources 
they need and start asking themselves the right questions? 
Igor: 
Excellent. Thank you very much. 
 
Mike: 
Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Do you get the idea of the exercise? This one’s going to seem the most like a 
normal conversation because this is the stuff we’re most used to, but still see 
if you can get to the edges of it and see if there are any inconsistencies in 
what they’re saying.  
 
 
Just get a sense of what their opinions are, what are their assumptions, what 
do they think about it, what do they think they know about it, how do they 
conceive the whole thing?

Notice how point of view, context and frame of reference comes into it at 
some point. Motivation will come into it at some point. Again, you’re coming 
at similar material from once again a different probing angle just to get a 
fuller richer picture of what’s going on. Are there any questions? 
 
 
We’ll do this one and we’ll have a little debrief and then I’ll show you 
something very interesting to do with this? Is that okay with you guys? Thank 
you very much. Give him a round of applause. 
 
Mike: 
Thank you. 
 
Demo Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Here’s what we’re going to do. In a moment, you’ll get a new partner, 
someone you haven’t worked with preferably. Ask a couple of just general 
setting the frame questions. Maybe ask about a context and motivation just  
to kind of get the general lay of the land, so to speak.  
 
 
Then just go into probing their concepts, their assumptions, their opinions 
and their thoughts, and see if they know the difference between an opinion 
and an assumption, and the difference between an assumption and a thought 
and so on. Maybe they do. Maybe they don’t. It doesn’t really matter too 
much. Just start gathering things. 
 
 
This is going to be relatively easy and this sounds like a very easy one, doesn’t 
it? There are a couple of things I want to add into this just to give you some 
things to pay attention to. 
 
 
 
Assessing Thoughts/Thinking: 
1. Clear & Concise 
2. Relevant, Important/Significant 
3. Precise & Accurate 
4. Fact, Opinion & Judgment 
 
 We’ve got this idea of being clear and concise.  
 We’ve got the idea of is this information relevant or important in 
relation to what we’re doing here. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
262 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 Now on top of these things, I want you to focus on how precise and 
accurate their thinking is.  
 
 
Then after this exercise I’ve got another thing we can do with this to clearly 
contrast against this. We may as well add this one as well because it kind of 
fits. You’ll be in groups of three again – A, B and C – the same sort of deal. On 
top of the stuff you’ve been doing before, ask yourself how precise or 
accurate is this person being? 
 
 
What do I mean by precision versus clarity? What’s the difference? Precision 
is about details. Clarity is in terms of just understanding. If I say what’s Mind 
Bending Language and you say it’s a way of triggering the amygdala so that 
we can break through automatic thought loops, that’s pretty clear. 
 
 
How precise am I being? Well, you have to use certain words like spatial 
predicates or things that will surprise them, so examples are good ways of 
checking their precision. 
 
 
What is accuracy about? A correct interpretation. It’s being able to distinguish 
between a fact and an opinion or a judgment, which kind of goes back into 
the next category as well. Hence, I put them out together at the same time. 
 
 
Do you have a rough idea of what I’m talking about with this? The best thing 
to do right now is have an experience of this. Are there any questions before 
we do that? Excellent.  
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Just general feedback – what’s happening now, what kinds of things did you 
notice, learn, experience, surprised by questions, just general open things. 
Just stand up and we’ll get a mic to you. Go ahead. 
 
Student: It was very interesting over here. I was laughing a little bit loud, so I’m sorry if 
I disturbed you guys but I noticed a lot of things. When Collin over here was 
conversing with both me and him, what really is amazing is when you consider 
what you haven’t considered. 
 
 
When people come out and they’re like what do you mean by that, it’s like no 
go back inside and really consider that because that’s where the unknown 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
263 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
territory is where you can learn so much from. Igor’s always doing this when 
we’re asking questions, including myself. 
 
 
I’m like what do you mean by that, and he just shoots it back at me. We need 
to think for ourselves, and that was a really empowering thing to really 
understand and the perspectives – you know because MBL is all about 
changing perspectives. That’s one aspect of it. 
 
 
It’s interesting to see the comical version of it because Collin’s a little bit of a 
comedian, and there are just some perspectives that you haven’t considered 
that just make you laugh ridiculously. It’s like think about this. Comedians are 
kind of using this stuff. What they do is they put you in unknown territory and 
you just start laughing ridiculously because you haven’t looked at it from that 
point of view. 
 
Igor: 
So, really what you’re talking about is what people think are thoughts and 
facts end up being more about assumptions and opinions and when they 
realize that, stuff starts happening. It starts getting mind bending. Is that kind 
of the summary of it? 
 
Student: Yes, that’s pretty much the summary of it.  
 
Igor: 
Did anyone else notice that or was it just him? Don’t worry. We have another 
exercise right after this, which will address this precise point because that is 
really one of the key features of asking these kinds of probing questions. 
Thank you for that, by the way. 
 
Student: What I noticed is in my group it was the fact that there was a disconnect and I 
could feel that, so at first when I was watching, there was a disconnect. I 
really asked myself a question. I said why is there a disconnect right now? 
 
Igor: 
Before you carry on, can you describe to us what you mean by a disconnect? 
 
Student: When I was sitting here and I was watching them interact, he was very 
animated. He was a little bit closed off. He was just asking the questions and 
he was kind of just asking the questions to just ask the questions to appease 
you, and I could feel that. 
 
 
You’re not appeasing anybody. You shouldn’t try to appease anybody. You 
should be here to learn for yourself and to really learn who you are. So, that’s 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
264 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
something I really noticed. It’s something actually me and Johnny were talking 
about.  
 
 
It’s that concept of when you connect with somebody, when you love 
somebody, when you really connect with them and you give them that look, 
and the look kind of just stares into your soul. It’s that look where everything 
else stops in the world and you’re the only ones that matter. I think that’s the 
most powerful thing that anybody can really do when you’re doing this. 
 
Igor: 
What you said just now reminds me of the old adage, which I’ve used a few 
times but I think it fits very nicely here – hypnosis is anything but a casual 
relationship. So, you choose when it’s actually appropriate but also you have 
to respect the fact that when you are doing it, there’s a lot of respect that has 
to come with it too. 
 
 
It’s just like with any very personal relationship. If it hasn’t got that respect 
that comes with it, then it’s not going to last very long. The same is true of 
your role as a hypnotist. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: No problem.  
 
Igor: 
Are there any other comments? 
 
Student: I had two very eloquent partners, who seemed to understand it very, very 
thoroughly, but personally I tabulated the whole thing with concepts, 
assumptions, opinions, thoughts and facts and I find it extremely difficult to 
differentiate what’s a concept and what’s an assumption? How do I tell the 
difference?  
 
Igor: 
I agree. 
 
Student: How do I tell the difference that this is an assumption and this is an opinion 
because both seem to be the same thing? 
 
Igor: 
I agree. 
 
Student: So, how do you do that? 
 
Igor: 
First let me ask you do you know for a fact that your partners could tell the 
difference between those things? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
265 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Well, from their eloquence, all I can do is deduce they’re very knowledgeable.  
 
Igor: 
So, if I understand you correctly, you’re saying you’re assuming that they 
knew more about this than you did. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did you know you were assuming it when you asked the question? 
 
Student: I was conceiving, maybe an assumption, but this was the way I perceived 
them that they know far more because I am new to this subject. 
 
Igor: 
I understand that you’re new and they seemed to be very eloquent. 
 
Student: So, I can’t draw the exact lines. Like I was supposed to be making a comment 
or you did this and you didn’t do that, but I was so confused in my own mind 
that I didn’t feel I had the right to say how did they do? 
 
Igor: 
First of all, if you have nothing in particular you want to say, you don’t have to 
say anything. Remember, this is not school. You don’t get marked down for 
just saying I’m just going to consider that. 
 
Student: Yes, but I’m also testing my own comprehension. 
 
Igor: 
That’s very true and that comes to the next level. I don’t even know if you 
realize it but I think everyone else has. You had a very eloquent distinction 
between concepts, assumptions and facts as it related to yourself.  
 
 
For example, you thought you conceived of the idea that the others were 
more eloquent than yourself. Unless I misunderstood you in our little 
interaction, you realized or came to realize it was an assumption because you 
haven’t even checked. Am I correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, how could you check an assumption? 
 
Student: If you have the time, you test it. It’s just like a hypothesis. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, but how would you test it in the kind of situation you were in?  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
266 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: You will probe more and ask more questions and see whether what you 
assumed was correct. 
 
Igor: 
I would agree with that. 
 
Student: It’s like in the earlier motivation and the context back and forth. 
 
Igor: 
Now taking your position as C, what makes you think you can’t do the same 
and probe your partners and ask did you know whether that was an 
assumption or a fact? 
 
Student: It was partly the question of time and I think it’s also to a great part that they 
introduce you to some deeper concepts and you get so involved that you 
forget that you are an analyzer and you should be thinking, which is the 
concept and which is the assumption.  
 
Igor: 
Right, so all you’re really saying is that if you had more time, this would be 
easier. Is that correct? 
 
Student: I think so, great. Well, you enjoy it when we give you more time later. For now 
just realize four minutes is not a huge amount of time, but we are just drilling 
certain things in. When we have a break later on, maybe you’ll want to go 
back to your partners and check whether you had assumptions or facts 
because that’s a very useful distinction to make, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I think you already know exactly how do to that now. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Give him a round of applause for that. Are there any other 
questions or comments? Go ahead. 
 
Student: I think I certainly learned the advantage of the pause. I’ve never really done 
that before. That has an incredible power, and some of the other people in 
the group did as well. They reinforced it, so it was great. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you.

Student: It seemed like it was about 20 minutes long but it was great. Four seconds. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the thing. Pauses, especially when we’re not used to them, they feel 
like they take forever but they can create just the right amount of space for 
things to actually happen in. 
 
Student: Yes, I noticed the answers I was getting kept coming and added questions for 
me to ask. It was wonderful. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. That’s a great insight. Thank you for that. Can we have a 
microphone over here please? 
 
Student: Thanks. I have a comment. My partner Bruce was interesting to watch him 
when he was the questioner because he went into the thinking state as much 
as the person being asked and that made it very fascinating because he was 
obviously engaged. Then the question I have is, is this Mind Bending Language 
actually hypnosis? 
 
Igor: 
That’s a good question.  
 
Student: Will you answer it? 
 
Igor: 
I will address it at some point towards the end of the seminar. 
 
Student: Okay. The reason I asked is because my other partner Bryant – we’re three B’s 
here – was comparing what we’re doing here. He said it would be very useful 
when he was going an induction, and I thought isn’t this hypnosis? I’m in a 
state of confusion. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just ask this. You said something very interesting there. You just asked 
a question. Could you repeat that last question you just asked? 
 
Student: No, I don’t remember what I said.  
 
Igor: 
I’ll reflect it back and I may get it incorrect, so please correct me if I’ve gotten 
this idea wrong. At some point, you were talking to your partner and he was 
talking about how he might use it in hypnosis, and you asked yourself the 
question isn’t this already hypnosis? Was that the question? 
 
Student: Yes. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
268 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Tell me a little more about why you thought of that question. 
 
Student: Because it was an assumption in his part that this is not hypnosis.  
 
Igor: 
And what were you thinking? 
 
Student: I’m assuming that it is. 
 
Igor: 
How come? 
 
Student: Because you’re the hypnosis guru and I’m here. 
 
 
[Applause] 
 
Igor: 
I see. So, that gives me a lot of leeway, doesn’t it? 
 
Student: What do you mean? 
 
Igor: 
I could do virtually anything and that means it’s hypnosis. Is that what you’re 
suggesting? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Great, welcome to Finger Painting 101. Just to give you an idea about this, 
there is an old debate. There are some who say that everything is hypnosis 
and there are some who say there’s no such thing as hypnosis. 
 
 
Personally I don’t care. If we happen to call something hypnosis, all we’re 
really doing is we’re putting a word on a set of experiences, which get a 
predicable outcome.  
 
 
So, in order to answer the question whether or not it’s hypnosis, I think the 
reference point should be less whether I’m doing the talking about it. It 
should be more a question of what you think hypnosis really is. 
 
 
If you were to define hypnosis as talking directly with someone’s unconscious 
mind and getting access to those kinds of skills, abilities, resources and so on, 
transformations that only occur in the unconscious mind, then I agree with 
you – if I understand you correctly – that most things can be hypnosis, 
including Finger Painting 101.

It’s not so much the subject that is hypnotic or not. It is the nature of the 
interaction, which means everything you’ve been doing here could be deep 
hypnosis and it could not. It has nothing to do with whether or not I’m doing 
it. It’s got more to do with how. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, it does. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. That was a great question, by the way. Give her a round of 
applause.  
 
Student: Actually, Barbara’s question triggered the question is it possible to use Mind 
Bending Language during an overt hypnosis? 
 
Igor: 
What do you think? 
 
Student: I think yes, actually I thought that it can. 
 
Igor: 
I think that’s something really worthwhile exploring. 
 
Student: Okay, thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Anyone else? 
 
Student: I had this fleeting thought when I heard the last question. Suppose you have 
put someone into hypnosis and the person is in trance. Then you’re speaking 
to the unconscious mind and then you use MBL. What would happen then if 
you say and besides and beyond and things like that?  
 
 
How would the unconscious mind answer you, because we are of course 
assuming that we all know how to speak to the unconscious mind and the 
unconscious mind will speak back to you, but in my experience of what I’ve 
seen, it would be just use simple questions, but if you use MBL to speak to the 
person who’s already deeply in trace, what happens then? 
 
Igor: 
There’s one thing I know. I know that you’re a very capable hypnotist because 
I’ve seen you do your work before. Another thing I know is that there are a lot 
of people in the room who are now curious about the very same question that 
you have. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
270 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The third thing I think I know – I’m not sure that I know – is that given enough 
time and motivation, you might find some of those people and try that out. If 
you think about it, there’s no way for you to actually know until you actually 
get the experience of it. 
 
 
Once you’ve tried that and done that and are willing to report back on this, I 
will be more than happy to share my experiences in comparison with yours. Is 
that a deal we can make? You don’t have to but nor do I. Ha-ha. You can stay 
curious or you can experiment. Either way is actually a pretty good state to be 
in. 
 
Student: What I found and not as much, I had very capable and compassionate 
partners here, but I found that the best interactions happened when we 
trusted ourselves enough to question, but there would be a tendency I found 
in myself that I had to pull back where I wanted to control it. I wanted to lead 
and it’s hard to trust the subconscious and trust that we’re asking – instead of 
asking and pushing. 
 
3 Questions Of Influence 
 
Igor: 
We may as well jump into this now, although it’s designed for a little later but 
it actually fits very nicely here. There are three kinds of questions you can use 
especially in the influence process.  
 
 
 
3 Questions: 
1. Psychologically Leading 
2. Logically Leading 
3. Intuitively Leading 
 
 
And I would pretty much leave those three in that order in terms of the 
impact it has on someone. 
 
1. A psychological leading question is the one where you already imply 
the answer pretty blatantly in the question. 
 
For example, would using hypnosis to help someone overcome a fear be a 
good thing or a bad thing? Have I given you any room to maneuver in that? 
No, it’s bad. You can’t use hypnosis to help people overcome problems. It’s a 
leading question, isn’t it? The answer is already implied within it. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
271 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
2. A logically leading question is the one where you actually to think it 
through to come to a clear, concise and precise answer of some sort. 
 
It depends on the context, but if they’ve given you a couple of facts, you can 
say you think X is the case and Y is the case, so what does that mean then? If 
you have X and you have Y, where does that take you? That’s a logically 
leading question, isn’t it? 
 
I excluded A, B and C from that, which are other things they could have been 
thinking about. I focused on X and Y. For example, you tell me that you really 
want people to overcome and live a better life, heal and feel better, and you 
tell me that you’re not sure that you’re a good person if you’re using hypnosis 
to do that.  
 
So, it just makes me curious. If someone really wants to help others and has a 
tool to do that, does that make them a good person or a bad one? It’s slightly 
psychologically leading but I’m really trying to engage them in a thinking 
process.  
 
A less leading question, a more logically leading question is if you’ve done this 
with one person and had this result, what do you think will happen when you 
do the same thing with more people? Logically you can conclude you’ll have 
the same result more often.  
 
These are logically leading questions. I’m just stacking up the elements they 
get to think about but it will still lead in a certain direction. Because they have 
to think it through, it internalizes more.  
 
3. An intuitively leading question goes even further than that because it 
can make a leap of logic. 
 
You saw this happening here for example when I think it was Joanne who 
came up here yesterday – for example when you have a strong emotion 
going.  
 
Let’s use the example of a public speaking fear. You’re talking to them and 
some way you find their motivation – I want to change the world, I want to 
make this world a better place – and they’re all excited. So, I can see clearly 
you’re very passionate about that. Yes, I really am.

So, I wonder what this has to do with your desire to get on stage. I just wish I 
could do it, get in front of people and just speak like that. Do you mean like 
that? Yes! That’s an intuitively leading question. There’s no logical connection. 
I’ve not psychologically implied anything. They’re already there. I’m letting 
them start addressing that.  
 
So, you’re feeling this way. What would you say to people? Well, I’d stand up 
and say you people have to do this and think about that. That’s what I want to 
say to them. That sounds pretty good to me why don’t you try that? All right 
then I will. 
 
Intuitively they’ve already gotten to that place and I’ve let them then, create 
their own logic as a result of it. I haven’t had to do much leading. I just have to 
let them connect the dots but in a leap of logic, in an intuitive leap. Does that 
make sense? Do you understand the nature of those three questions? 
 
When anyone says questioning is a really nice way of doing things because 
you’re not putting anything into it and there’s really no influencing going on 
there, it’s not true. Every question already binds or frees someone’s thinking 
with the nature of the question. 
 
May I give you an example of this? We’ll do this as a thought experiment for 
all of us. We’re now in 2012, unless I’ve time warped. So, let’s use that as a 
number for us to play with. Do you know the Wimbledon Tennis 
Championship? Is everyone familiar with that? 
 
I don’t know if you know how heats work. You basically have everyone who 
enters the tournament play a match, and then the winner goes through the 
next round and the loser goes. It’s simple, right? The only exception to that is 
if there’s an odd number of people in a particular round, one person will get 
an automatic buy to go to the next round because there’s an odd number of 
people and they don’t have anyone to play with otherwise. 
 
So, you continue playing in that way until you basically have the last match 
and then you have a clear winner. Let’s assume this is the 2012 Wimbledon 
Championships and there are 2,012 people that enter the competition. The 
question is how many matches will have to be played in order for you to have 
a declared winner? One match? No.

Here’s something interesting that’s happening. All of you are thinking okay 
2,012 and that makes 1,006, and you’re almost mentally working out what 
the number is. One or two of you who are more mathematically oriented will 
try to come up with an algorithm to calculate that. 
 
Now I’m going to ask you the question again. One person already knows the 
answer because I think we did this before. I don’t know if we did or not. I’m 
going to ask you the same question again differently, and I’m going to move 
your mind into the instant recognition of the answer. Would that be an 
impressive magic trick? 
 
This by the way is a magic moment. The question is this reformulated but it’s 
exactly the same question. How many people have to lose a match before you 
have a clear winner? 2,011. That’s your answer because everyone only gets to 
lose once, and everyone has to lose once for one person to win. 
 
So, the questions that you ask are all leading one way or another. The 
question I asked originally was actually logically leading and partly 
psychologically leading. I was leading you down a particularly difficult path of 
logic to work out the answer.  
 
The second question was more intuitively leading – it was actually slightly 
psychologically leading as well – because it presented the answer 
straightaway to you. It made it apparent to you. So, do you understand 
another nuance to the whole questioning game? Thank you for that. Are 
there any other questions before we move on? 
 
What I’d like to do now is borrow you again for this. Stay in your groups. You’ll 
see why in a moment. Come on up. Give him a round of applause. Thank you 
very much.  
 
We’re going to do the exercise again. We’re going to again focus on concepts, 
assumptions, opinions, thoughts, facts and so on, only this time now that 
you’ve done it with something you’ve all been thinking about already, I’d like 
for you to have a contrast with something else, which usually has less thinking 
involved, as a result of which there’s no actual judgment going on here.  
 
This is the demonstration of how people are thinking in that sense, right? So, 
I’m going to change the topic because it will help us to actually get to that

point a little bit more fully. The question I have for you is, are you a free man? 
Do you see a more unconscious response happening straightaway?  
 
This is something that we in most societies don’t really think about. We’re 
given an answer by the way, aren’t we? We’re the free West, free thinking, 
but are you a free man? What do you think? I’ll make it easier. Do you think 
you’re a free man? 
 
Mike: 
Sometimes. 
 
Igor: 
Sometimes. That’s a little bit easier question to answer, isn’t it? What makes 
you think that you’re free sometimes?  
 
Mike: 
When I can really express myself and do things that I feel I want to do. 
 
Igor: 
And when do you feel you’re not free? 
 
Mike: 
When I feel like I’m constrained by social expectations, role expectations, 
legal boundaries and things like that – not that I want to do anything illegal. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, that’s interesting. So, you think that if someone wants to do something 
illegal, then it’s immoral. Is that what you’re suggesting? 
 
Mike: 
No, not at all. 
 
Igor: 
So, what was that little quip about then? I’m genuinely interested in this. 
What was the thought behind that joke about not wanting to do anything 
illegal? 
 
Mike: 
Well… 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you again. Do you see how much more thinking is going on 
here? How many questions did I have to ask about opinions, assumptions and 
facts to get there? Very few because this is not a topic that most people 
spend much time thinking about, right? I’m genuinely actually curious about 
the answer, so go ahead. 
 
Mike: 
Well, some laws that are put in place are not really a question of morality or 
immorality. They’re there because of political or social direction, conformity 
and things like that.

So, in complying with those laws or breaking them, you’re not really doing 
anything that would harm yourself or others, but you’d go against maybe 
popular opinion or some political direction that’s being implied. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. So, coming back – this is the relevancy frame – to this idea of freedom, 
what is freedom? Let me pause you again just to take a little step back. How 
are you feeling right now when I’m asking you these questions? Do you feel a 
little bit on the spot? 
 
Mike: 
Yes and no. Yes there’s pressure to try to come up with the answer, but it’s a 
gentle pressure because it’s engaging. 
 
Igor: 
It’s non-judgmental. You can tell that I’m not going to rip you a new one for 
disagreeing with me because you’re wrong!  
 
Mike: 
Right. Go back to your seat! 
 
Igor: 
Yes, go back to your seat! You are free! That’s the answer! You’re free! 
Repeat after me – I am free! Go! This reminds of a genuine event. There’s a 
big motivational speaker. I won’t mention his name. He does this whole 
leadership program and there are like 2,000 people in the stadium. That 
probably tells you who it was. 
 
 
The funniest part for me was when he pumps his fist in the air and says repeat 
after me – I’m a leader, not a follower! 
 
Mike: 
Steve Martin did a similar thing. 
 
Igor: 
It just amuses me. This is a relatively short exercise in terms of the 
demonstration. I will give you more time to explore this. Feel free to choose 
another topic. If you’re stuck for a topic, the idea of freedom I think is a very 
useful one, partly because it actually is a genuinely useful thing for you to 
think about as a human being. 
 
 
Let’s face it. Does anyone here want to live a happy fulfilling life? Does anyone 
here think their freedom has anything to do with being happy and fulfilled? 
Some people do and some people don’t. Most people do. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

To the extent that it does, that’s a question worth asking. To the extent that it 
doesn’t you may well ask, what does lead towards it? Personally I’m of the 
opinion that freedom does promote happiness and the absence of freedom 
promotes unhappiness. 
 
 
You’re welcome to challenge me on that, but did you see how quickly we’re 
now into a topic where you can really get your teeth into, and you now have 
stuff where you can really have concepts, assumptions, opinions, thoughts 
and facts contrast against each other in a very much more stark sort of way, 
so it will be a lot easier to tell the distinction between them? 
 
 
Do you understand the nature of the exercise everyone? First of all, let’s give 
Mike a round of applause. Thank you very much.  
 
Student: Doesn’t it lead a person to doubt his freedom, so isn’t it kind of… 
 
Igor: 
It might do. 
 
Student: So, I was supposed to… 
 
Igor: 
Let’s put it this way. What is the danger of someone doubting whether they’re 
free or not? 
 
Student: Their view on life starts changing. 
 
Igor: 
And what’s the problem with that? 
 
Student: They can become depressed. 
 
Igor: 
They might if you psychologically lead them and leave them in an unpleasant 
place. Let me put it this way, and I’m just using the indoctrination version for 
the sake of speed. You can lead them to a depressed state because they 
conceive of themselves being less free than they thought they were. 
 
 
If on the other hand you actually help them at that point to decide what 
actual freedom is, and instead of being depressed they realize they better do 
something about being more free than they actually are so they can be as free 
as they thought they should be, isn’t that an empowering thing?

Student: Well, I remember an old question. Is it better to be an unhappy Socrates than 
to be a happy pig? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, there’s the old question – to reframe that one – that says ignorance is 
bliss, but then consider this. How many times do we pay the consequences of 
our ignorance and wonder what the heck we keep paying this consequence 
for without realizing what’s going on? 
 
 
The nice part is you only have four minutes, so you can really mess someone 
up. So, if you really want to mess someone up in those four minutes, go for it. 
If, of course, you’re inclined to that. But I have a feeling that the frame has 
changed enough already that whatever damage you think you can do, you 
won’t here.  
 
 
It is actually a useful question to ask yourself by the way, and this is a 
question of ethics, isn’t it? If you’re going to open a box like that, you’re 
correct that there is a very strong set of ethical implications that wherever 
people are left, that has to be a good starting point to somewhere better. 
 
 
Putting those things generally into that perspective when you’re doing the 
exercise now, hopefully you’ll be more confident or comfortable doing that 
without having a row of people hanging from the rafters outside. Not the kind 
of decoration that I’d be particularly interested in exploring here. 
 
 
Thank you for asking though because that is actually a genuinely important 
ethical consideration to take into account, isn’t it? Aside from that particular 
question, are there any other things before we do the exercise? 
 
Student: Other than the topic that we’re choosing, I’m not clear what’s different about 
this exercise than the last one. 
 
Igor: 
They’re identical. That is actually why you’re not clear. The only difference in 
this exercise is you will see the distinctions between concepts, assumptions, 
opinions, facts, thoughts, etc. more clearly the less someone’s thought about 
it. 
 
 
Mind Bending Language is something that all of you have been thinking about 
for some time, at the very least because you’ve had two days of thinking 
about it. Hence, it’s a little more difficult to tell the distinction.

278 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
We’re now opening a topic up. Freedom is a very useful one for this because 
everyone thinks they know about it, but actually very few people have 
thought about it enough to actually have facts, thoughts, assumptions, 
opinions etc. separated in their minds. 
 
 
You’ll not only stay in the same group, but I’d also like you to take the same 
roles you did before so that you’re questioning the same person, the same 
mind, because that will give you a contrast to what happened before. Do you 
understand? So, it’s the same groups, the same roles, the same person is A 
first, B first, C first and so on. In that way, you’ll have a nice contrast to what 
you did immediately before this to see a clearer contrast between these 
ideas. 
 
 
The question is whatever you want it to be, but start with what do you think 
freedom is? Do you think you’re a free person? Explore that if you have no 
other default. Four minutes apiece, starting now. 
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
I have a suspicion that some interesting things just happened to you guys. 
Would that be fair to say? The first question I have before I even ask you what 
happened – because that is going to be a very interesting question, so please 
keep that in mind – is why? Why do you think this exercise was so much more 
animating than some of the others you’ve been going through? 
 
Student: My observation was that I was more comfortable. Each time we go through 
these exercises, I get more comfortable asking these questions, so that was 
the main thing for me, and it’s enjoyable to just sit back and feed the person 
and then they feed you back where they give you more ideas of things to ask. 
 
Igor: 
Part of that is of course a learning process. What else do you think is the 
reason why this exercise was one of the more animated ones? Just stand up. 
 
Student: This one involved a little bit more I want to say passion. I mean my partner’s 
still red. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely.

279 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: And it’s more personal as opposed to Mind Bending Language – yes, we’re 
here to learn and stuff like that, but when we mentioned freedom, a little 
abstract and each one of us has a little different concept of it, and there are 
some trigger points. There’s economy, family constraints – can’t do this 
because I have to take care of my family. So, it actually evoked more emotion. 
 
Igor: 
There’s a lot of emotion here because I specifically gave you a very loaded 
topic. In fact, I thought carefully about which one I should give you. I had a 
couple in mind. The reason this is loaded is for several reasons: 
 
1. It is a fundamentally important issue in our lives. 
 
2. It’s something, despite how fundamentally important it is, that we 
really don’t spend much time thinking about. 
 
3. We think about all the consequences of having or not having it, but we 
don’t actually think of the actual main thing. 
 
 
So, we have a lot of material that surrounds the idea of freedom. We have 
very little experience of actually thinking about the concept of freedom itself, 
and it’s so important to us that, of course, the topic has a lot of passion, as 
you say.  
 
 
Those are three core reasons why a lot of emotion comes out and a lot of 
excitement and so on. However, there’s another reason on top of that – and 
that’s actually a core reason by the way why that exercise was so passionate. 
What else do you think might be going on – and you are 100% correct of 
course. 
 
Student: Most of the things that he just brought up were things that I was going to say, 
but the other part of it that I found with my group – all three of us already 
had considered the question and had a solid starting point to start talking 
about it. I think all three of us were talking about it as part of our identities.  
 
Igor: 
It’s a very important part of an identity. 
 
Student: Guarding and explaining part of what you are to other people.

Igor: 
This is very important. You now have a more dramatic example of why you 
never want to argue with someone directly. Let’s do a little role play of the 
wrong way to do this. So, would you say you’re free? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Based on what? 
 
Student: I am free to take any action that the physical world will allow me to take as 
long as I accept the consequences. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, is that really freedom then if you have to take consequences? 
 
Student: I’m free to make the choice every time. 
 
Igor: 
You’re wrong. Thank you. And that really was the socially polite version of 
how an argument like that actually ensues isn’t it? Because as soon as I say no 
you’re wrong and what freedom really is; is this – it’s not the Lichtenstein; this 
is the Hulk.  
 
 
And that’s how we get ourselves into a lot of hot water because we make 
assumptions or we have ideas that are such a close part of our identity. Now 
you can feel what it feels like when someone actually attacks an idea that is so 
close to you that it may as well be your identity. 
 
 
You never know what ideas that people are particularly attached to. Hence, 
you want to be very careful. You want to explore the idea well before you 
start attacking and going down that road.  
 
 
My preference, of course, is to use your Mind Bending Language and your 
questioning skills to increase their choices so that if they want to go back to 
the idea they had, that’s great, but they might come up with a better idea and 
they can discard the old one. 
 
 
It’s very much like when Mike was describing his concept of Mind Bending 
Language. His original understanding of Mind Bending Language was great – a 
pattern interrupt that works, it’s like a shock induction. It’s a great way for 
you to think about it as a starting point. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
281 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
However, he has a much richer idea of it. It doesn’t mean he has to release 
the old idea. He can still use it as a shock induction, can’t he? But he has a 
much richer idea, which means my influencing him has actually improved him. 
Are you glad that I influenced you, Michael? 
 
 
That’s how you get to the point where you can influence people ethically and 
do it in such a way that they will thank you for it. That’s what we really want 
because that’s when you have a real win-win. Thank you for that. I appreciate 
that. 
 
 
There’s one more thing that I’m still thinking of though, but whether or not to 
read my mind, who knows? I’ll tell you eventually anyways. There was a hand 
over here. 
 
Student: I noticed that some of my personal thoughts kind of slipped into the 
questions, and our opinion of freedom was very, very different. We noticed 
that there were some regional differences, for example, and towards the end 
it kind of took a turn and I almost came up with oh see… 
 
Igor: 
See? I’m right. 
 
Student: And I slipped into that and I didn’t notice it until it happened.  
 
Igor: 
Right and this is a very important thing again. We can talk until the cows come 
home about not putting your fish in their dreams, not trying to manipulate 
them in a negative sense, not trying to give them the freedom – there it is 
again – to choose their own way and so on, but when we are attached to an 
idea it’s very tempting to get involved in it, isn’t it? 
 
 
Again, that’s something you need to be careful of. Even if you want to 
persuade them of your idea – which as long as you’re doing it in an ethical 
choice-based way, I think is just fine – you still have to give them the freedom 
of thought to come up with a better idea than you had. 
 
 
This goes right back to what your point was on the very first day, which is why 
you do want to be influenced by them because in the process of doing this, 
you may actually end up having a better solution, a better idea, a better way 
of doing things than you had originally thought of.

So, if you got purely your way, you might actually be more impoverished than 
if you let yourself be mutually influenced in this style or this approach. Does 
that concept make sense to you? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: This will be I guess a little pre-frame. My question is actually going to flip this 
model upside down for a second. I was told by Mercedes once – she said good 
friends are friends that will make you cry. 
 
Igor: 
Slap! 
 
Student: That really got me and I really considered that because sometimes when 
we’re with friends, they kind of just tell you bluntly what they think and they 
just kind of push things on you.  
 
 
I’m trying to consider here that sometimes being gentle – and using this 
model is very effective and I use it a lot – but my question is in which context 
would it be useful to actually just break that in a way that just gets them to 
really consider because it’s kind of very gentle and it’s very nice and smooth 
and easy, but for some people it doesn’t really clearly spell out for them 
exactly where they need to be. In which context would you just say you’re 
wrong and it would be useful? 
 
Igor: 
First of all, how does what you’re asking me now relate back to the quote you 
gave us, which Mercedes gave you – the idea of crying? 
 
Student: How does it relate back to it? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, your question. 
 
Student: Well, I needed to hear what I heard, and I didn’t like it. 
 
Igor: 
You didn’t like hearing what you heard but… 
 
Student: It made a difference. 
 
Igor: 
It made a difference, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And you were glad about that, right?

Student: Now I am. 
 
Igor: 
At the time of course it was hard to take. 
 
Student: Yes, it was like what is wrong with you? 
 
Igor: 
Of course when she said whatever she said – preframing that and so on – 
when you heard that, you shook her hand, thanked her and said thank you 
very much, I really enjoyed that and I really have grown as a person because 
of that, so thank you. 
 
Student: I did that externally but internally I was like oh God I’m never talking to her 
about that again. 
 
Igor: 
Then what happened? 
 
Student: It was that seed and I just kept thinking about it and I said I didn’t like it at first 
but at some level I needed to hear that, and no one else would have told me 
that except she said real friends. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a very good frame. The question for you is first of all how many 
different ways do you think you had to get to that realization that includes 
this one? That’s one worth considering and there’s another one. The other 
one worth considering is what makes you think that what she did didn’t bend 
your mind? 
 
Student: Oh, it did. 
 
Igor: 
So, we’re here doing Mind Bending Language and the outcome was 
important.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Now correct me if I’m wrong, but would I be accurate in thinking that she had 
enough of a relationship with you that despite the bitter pill you had to 
swallow… 
 
Student: It was okay. Yes.

Igor: 
Because there was enough… 
 
Student: Rapport and connection with them. 
 
Igor: 
Other things going on. Let me put it this way. Was she judging you or actually 
showing you a better you? 
 
Student: It depends on how I felt. At the time I was like she’s judging me, how could 
she? Then afterwards I said was she really judging me? So, I considered that 
possibility too. 
 
Igor: 
What you experienced you might call a slow burning fuse. 
 
Student: Oh, yeah. 
 
Igor: 
And that can be tremendous. Does that answer your question? 
 
Student: I want to say yes but there’s a part of me that’s not entirely clear on how I can 
do that myself with other people. 
 
Igor: 
So, if you were to think about doing one version or another, how might you 
decide? 
 
Student: Well, if this wasn’t working, then I would just jump right on that. I don’t know. 
I think that’s one possibility. 
 
Igor: 
So, you’re saying you have one way of knowing. So, in other words if one way 
of doing things doesn’t work out, you might just decide to go to till they get 
the point and there are others. Did I correctly hear you on that one? Even 
though you may not think of them right now, right? 
 
Student: Oh, of course. There has to be others. 
 
Igor: 
Right. That’s something definitely worth exploring. 
 
Student: Okay, I’m satisfied with that. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: Thank you.

Igor: 
And I mean that because this is something that has no cut and dried answer. 
This is something that you will have intuitive leaps about as you’re doing it. 
So, there’s a time to be blunt and there’s a time not to. 
 
Student: I’m just feeling like sometimes gentle and easy just isn’t exactly what a person 
needs. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a good instinct.  
 
Student: Okay, I just want to refine that. That’s all. 
 
Igor: 
That’s something that you have to refine with experience because that’s 
something that’s such a delicate judgment call that there is no hard and fast 
rule that I know of. That’s something that you will, as you quite nicely said, 
have to feel your way through. 
 
Student: Okay, I just answered that next question I had. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Would you like to give the question and the answer to everyone else? 
 
Student: Sure. I was thinking about maybe I could ask the person how would they 
basically like their feedback on what I think about them, but I was also 
considering if they wanted it cut and dry and straight to the point, maybe 
even though they’re saying that, it may not be useful for them. 
 
 
But I guess it comes down to calibration and just paying attention and 
noticing what’s working and what isn’t, so it all comes back to your results 
and is whatever you’re doing working? If it isn’t, change it up. 
 
Igor: 
So, you’re telling me basically you could preframe your bluntness to make it 
mind bending? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I like that idea. 
 
Student: It’s another way. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, you’re getting more?

Student: Yes, they’re going to probably just keep popping out throughout the rest of 
the day. 
 
Igor: 
That’s exactly how it works. Well done. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Do you want to pass the mic on back? 
 
Student: It just occurred to me that when you talk about firing a client, it’s an example 
of what he’s talking about. 
 
Igor: 
That’s exactly right. When you fire a client because they’re kind of ambivalent 
about change, it’s kind of the question you had up here before. That’s another 
one. They’re racking up now, aren’t they? Long may that continue. Carry on. 
 
Student: Freedom is one of those artfully vague terms like Erickson uses, where just 
about anybody can throw their meaning into it. It’s like what they can in NLP a 
nominalization. Anybody can just go to town with it.  
 
 
What I realized during the lesson here was when I was working with 
Cassandra, she quoted a song that meant freedom and she really, really lit up 
during that time, and then my line of questioning led her more to shut down 
because I was suddenly taking it to a more intellectual place. 
 
 
The lesson that I’m learning from here is that there are times when we can 
ride along with the artfully vague so that she can continue to light up rather 
than shutting down.  
 
 
I came along with an almost yes but answer, whereas I could have responded 
with a yes and – like oh wow, and what else does that quote mean to you – 
and continued along with the artfully vague approach as opposed to the more 
dissecting approach. 
 
Igor: 
If I hear you correctly, allow me to just paraphrase just to see if I understand 
you correctly. Are you suggesting that when you’re doing these mind bending 
probing questions that one of the things that you’re paying attention to when 
assessing the quality of their thoughts and their thinking is their emotional 
responses?

Student: Yes, absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
And based on that, as well as of course some of the other things, that will 
determine what and how you present your next question. 
 
Student: Absolutely. And whether to surf the artfully vague for a while for as long as 
that wave will take me, and then at a certain point take it somewhere else. 
 
Igor: 
It can have great value, absolutely. That’s a great insight. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: I really have a question actually because I’ve done martial arts for years and I 
know you have too, so I guess it’s a martial artist to a martial artist right now. 
 
Igor: 
Everyone please leave. This is a private conversation. 
 
Student: There you go. 
 
Igor: 
Unless you want to stay, in which case I’ll fight you for it. 
 
Student: I’m just wondering my sensei always told me it’s always better to be a leader, 
and I’m learning that that’s not entirely true. So, my question to you is when 
is it better to be just a follower? 
 
Igor: 
There’s a thought behind that, isn’t there? You’re actually thinking of a 
specific kind of context or a situation, are you not? 
 
Student: I am. 
 
Igor: 
Tell me more about that. 
 
Student: So, being a follower within the context of a communication, I’m the kind of 
person that loves to impose their beliefs on people. I love it. It’s just who I am 
and I guess that’s how I was trained, and it’s actually how I teach martial arts, 
which is not always the best thing. So, what do I have to do? 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here because you just said something very interesting. 
You said that’s not always the best thing. There are times when it’s great. I 
appreciate that. But you also mentioned there are times when it’s not the 
best thing, so I suspect you’ve had an experience of that.

Student: Oh, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Like what? 
 
Student: My business partner and me are here. We fight all the time. It’s true. He’s this 
big picture kind of guy and I’m a chunk down type of person. I love detail. He 
was pacing and leading like we were learning in NLP, and I was having a really 
hard time with it because I love to impose my beliefs. I just love to put my two 
cents in. 
 
 
 
Sometimes he’s like you just have to shut up. So, he gave it to me just like that 
– you just have to shut up and listen, you have two ears and one mouth for a 
reason. That’s the kind of thing. I honestly don’t know the strategy to do that. 
 
Igor: 
You don’t know the strategy to do that or when to do that? 
 
Student: Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
When might you do that? 
 
Student: When might I do that? I might do that when I’m working with clients.  
 
Igor: 
That’s an interesting time for it, right? 
 
Student: Yes, when I’m teaching kids especially. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a wonderful one. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Especially the kids one because believe it or not those two categories are very 
similar, and I think you appreciate what I mean by that. 
 
Student: Yes, absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
So, what is it with children that taking that role rather than the ‘this is how it 
is’ role, what do you think that they can gain from that? 
 
Student: Life isn’t too serious. It shouldn’t be that serious.

Igor: 
Right. 
 
Student: I take everything serious. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, there’s the question of an emotional response there, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, an emotional response might be a signal as to when it’s appropriate and 
when it might not be. 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
So, that’s one of those ways. 
 
Student: That’s one way, yes. 
 
Igor: 
What else might there be? 
 
Student: Instead of being silly and stuff, I mean really just taking the mother role. I do 
that with a lot of the students because a lot of the kids come in there and it 
sucks because their family walks out on them.  
 
 
My family did the same thing. They’re like oh you do this but we don’t really 
like that you do this but we’re going to walk out. It makes them feel a certain 
way, so I try to take that role model role.  
 
Igor: 
What’s the purpose of being a role model? 
 
Student: What’s the purpose of being a role model? 
 
Igor: 
I’m serious. What do you think the purpose is? What’s the point of being a 
role model? 
 
Student: To me, it’s to give them that feeling of all right someone loves me and 
someone cares about me and someone’s going to talk to me. 
 
Igor: 
All right, so when especially a child feels loved, talked to and so on, what does 
it do for that child?

Student: It just opens them up to all the possibilities that they need. 
 
Igor: 
It opens them up, so really it’s about giving children possibilities. Is that what 
you’re telling me? 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
When you’re in that sort of giving your opinion thing, which of those three are 
you doing? 
 
Student: Indoctrination. 
 
Igor: 
What opens children up? 
 
Student: Education. 
 
Igor: 
Does that begin to answer your question better? 
 
Student: That’s mind blowing right there. 
 
Igor: 
I have one more question for you, if I may. 
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Did I just lead or did I just follow? 
 
Student: I have no idea. Both? 
 
Igor: 
Right and how does that feel? 
 
Student: Balanced. 
 
Igor: 
And I think you know your answer now. 
 
Student: I do. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. 
 
Student: Thank you.

DVD 9 – Building Hypnotic Authority With 
Inferences, Summarizations & Conclusions 
 
 
Performance Skills 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back everyone. Who had a good lunch? Who’s finding their 
lunchtime conversations are beginning to flourish somewhat, become more 
interesting? If not, I would ask you the question why not, because the stuff 
you’re doing in here really shouldn’t stay in here. This is not Vegas. 
 
 
For those of you who are not familiar with North America, there’s a saying 
“what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,” whereas I have the opposite attitude. 
What happens at my seminars goes home because that’s where you want to 
use it. 
 
 
The more you start using this stuff outside of this context, in this actual room, 
the more likely you’ll be using it constantly and it will become just one of 
those natural skill sets that you use everywhere and it makes you more 
influential, and that’s really what I would like for you. 
 
 
Before we get into the next bit of content, I just want to check in with you. 
Are there any questions or comments in terms of what we’ve covered so far, 
because we’ve come quite an interesting way so far? No? In that case, there is 
another question I want to present to you and it has to do with the 
performance skills in terms of doing this stuff. 
 
 
What makes something overt and what would allow something to be more 
covert? 
 
Student: Covert would be language patterns buried in this kind of language we’re 
learning here, and overt is more direct. 
 
Igor: 
What makes the direct approach more overt and more noticeable, and the 
language patterns more covert, which is another way of saying more 
unnoticeable? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
293 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: The person you’re talking to will recognize more of what you’re saying when 
you’re overt as opposed to covert. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, really what defines overt and covert is not so much the 
language you use – if I can extrapolate your thought – but it’s really how 
much the person you’re talking to can notice you’re doing something.  
 
 
Does that fit your understanding of overt and covert? So, WHAT if I started to 
SPEAK in WAYS that are somewhat UNUSUAL? There’s nothing STRANGE 
about my language patterns, is there? So, I MUST be VERY COVERT right now, 
or not. What’s happening? What’s going on there? Does anyone care to 
comment? Hands up. What was happening there? What went wrong there? 
 
Student: What you’re demonstrating there was a communication style that was 
outside of the context of what normal conversation would be.  
 
Igor: 
What makes normal conversation normal? 
 
Student: It is the sum average of basically how we communicate, and that’s what we 
view as standard. 
 
Igor: 
For a slightly less scientific explanation, what would you in everyday language 
say was different about what I just did compared to a regular conversation? 
 
Student: Everything you just did there, the tonality was exaggerated. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. It’s not even necessarily exaggerated, although that was part of it. 
It’s just my tonality was anything but casual, wasn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
It was off. It was weird. It was downright strange, right? Especially when we’re 
going to more language pattern things, as soon as you start thinking a 
different way, your language or your tonality, your rhythms and stuff like that 
will change.  
 
 
A lot of you are already doing the natural conversational style, even with 
asking your questions and so on, which is excellent. However, some of you are 
still doing something and ASKING a question that’s MORE than you would 
normally ask.

I’m hamming it up a little bit, but you appreciate how obvious something like 
this can be in a conversation, right? I get a lot of comments from people 
emailing who get one program or another and they kind of misunderstand 
some of the concepts, especially around casualness and tonality, and they’ll 
say this is supposed to be covert, this stuff doesn’t work. 
 
 
Of course, I say what exactly are you talking about that doesn’t work? Well, I 
was talking to my friends and they could all tell I’m doing something. They’d 
look at me funny and say you’re doing something, aren’t you? WELL, if YOU 
want them to KNOW, then you can TELL them like THIS. 
 
 
And if you don’t want them to know, then you need to pay attention to how 
you feel and how you sound when you have a normal conversation. This is an 
interesting idea, isn’t it? How many of us actually pay attention to what we 
sound and feel like and what we move like when we’re having just a regular 
conversation? A few of you, but is an unusual audience. 
 
 
Most of us don’t do that, and because we don’t do that we don’t know when 
we’ve stopped being ourselves. As soon as we don’t know we’re ourselves, 
then everyone who knows us will know and then you stop being covert.  
 
 
There’s nothing wrong with being overt by the way. In certain contexts it 
works great. If they’re coming to you for therapy or if you’re a coach, then 
you CAN speak like THIS and they’ll just think that’s what hypnosis sounds 
like. 
 
Student: You just brought up a really good point just so quickly. The communication 
that you’re doing which is all weird was very incongruent to how you normally 
are and if we do this congruent to how we normally are, then it’s just 
accepted. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. Would anyone disagree with that? No, I agree with you 100%. So, I 
think it’s time at this point, seeing as we’ve hit the halfway point, that we all 
got to discover a little bit about what do we normally sound like, what do we 
normally act like and what does it mean to be congruently you? 
 
 
Only then do you know when you’ve stopped that and have gone from being 
covert to being more overt again. That makes sense, doesn’t it? This is going 
to be very easy. We don’t need very much time for this.

All I want you to do is turn to the person next to you. Make sure you have a 
person to talk to and just spend two minutes talking to each other and pay 
attention to yourself this time. Before you go, there’s one more thing.  
 
 
Pay attention to what you sound like yourself this time because I’ll give you a 
little advanced notice. Right after this we’ll do another exercise and if you can 
tell that you’re not sounding like yourself, then you can do something about 
it. 
 
 
And if you can tell that they’re not being themselves – so you want to stay 
with the same person for both exercises – then it will be your job to tell them 
ha-ha, I spotted you, you’ve now become overt, Mr. Covert. Two minutes 
apiece, start now. 
 
 
Now you know what a regular conversation with you sounds like, right? Now 
we’re going to see if we can get a little subtle on this. I’ll ask you a question, 
and please really consider this first and only put your hand up if this is true for 
you, and only keep your hand down if it’s not. 
 
 
Please put your hand up if you’ve ever been particularly thoughtful – in other 
words you’ve had thoughts running around your mind and you really got 
curious about them and got absorbed by them. If you’ve ever been absorbed 
by your thoughts, please put your hands up. 
 
 
That’s good. I’m glad to hear that. Would it be fair to say that when you’re 
absorbed in your thoughts, it’s still your natural style; it’s just different to 
what you just did. Would that be fair to say?  
 
 
What I’d like you to do now is have the same conversation with the same 
person or maybe carry on from where you were, but somewhere in that 
conversation just ask yourself a question about something. Really think about 
it and allow yourself to remember or recall the sensation of being thoughtful. 
 
 
When the other person is getting thoughtful on you, just wonder to yourself 
or ask yourself whether or not they’re being thoughtful or if they’re DOING 
something odd. Do you understand the nature of the exercise? Same person, 
two minutes apiece, so four minutes in total. Off you go.

Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Who enjoyed that? Who was busted? One person got busted? Two people got 
busted? That’s not bad odds. I like that. How did you shift gears so that you 
could go from a normal chatty conversation to a more thoughtful 
conversation where you actually had to think things through a little bit? What 
kinds of things did you do? Go ahead. 
 
Student: I noticed that the conversation is slower, more pauses, but not necessarily a 
change in tonality or volume. 
 
Igor: 
Right, but the quality is a bit slower speech and more natural pauses. If that’s 
how you communicate when you’re being thoughtful, when you’re thinking, 
what do you think you need to be doing if you want someone else to be 
thoughtful or thinking?  
 
 
Would this be a useful way of going there first, because you could do Mind 
Bending Language very quickly as well if you wanted to? Think about that 
completely and thoroughly right now. What’s your answer? Is that conducive 
to thoughtfulness? In some contexts but they’ll be fewer than the other, 
right? Did you want to add something to that, Amir? 
 
Amir: 
I was experimenting with it in a few different ways. The first way I was like 
hmmm, I wonder – oh, I just stumbled across something really amazing. What 
happens if we do this? I asked the question and I just paused and I was 
thinking about it, and then I started answering the question and then I was 
like whoa, and he just looks at me and he starts thinking what, what, what? 
 
 
I thought that was a different kind of energy in thoughtfulness. One way is 
where they’re thoughtful about what you’re going to say, and the other one is 
thoughtful about what they’re thinking and does it match? So, it was like a 
different energy in the thoughtfulness. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. So, you understand that you have some range with this stuff.  
 
Student: One thing if you know Amir, he talks about a mile a minute and normal people 
really can’t process that. Just letting you know. 
 
Igor: 
That was direct. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
297 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Yes, it was. Very direct, right? 
 
Igor: 
Don’t try. He’s still your friend. 
 
Student: I have to give direct feedback sometimes but it’s okay. 
 
Igor: 
I get it. 
 
Student: But it’s like verbal diarrhea sometimes. Do you know what I mean? I’m just 
letting you know. If it’s verbal diarrhea, if it comes in like that, it’s going to 
come out like that. All right? 
 
Igor: 
This is an important point, which is what we said about going first. People 
tend to model each other in conversations. When the other person slowed 
down and became more thoughtful in the conversation, how did you feel in 
response to that? Did they kind of drag you into that? 
 
Student: When I was talking with Phil, I started with the normal conversation, normal 
flow, and then I kind of used the Columbo effect to slow down my tone. 
 
Igor: 
Columbo was a master at this. 
 
Student: So, I kind of paused and let him think I was thinking of the answer just to slow 
down my tone, and then I gradually did that further and further and further 
into the conversation and he said it sounded very natural. 
 
Igor: 
I have no doubt it was. That’s really one of the keys to this.  
 
Student: I was just listening to my partner and actually not understanding too well 
what was going on, and my real question is around that. As soon as I went 
into my thoughtful state, I noticed my thoughts and my body relax, especially 
physiological shifts as I went to that space, but I was no way able to even 
comprehend anything she was saying now. 
 
Igor: 
So, you went to that state whilst they were talking, or you went into that state 
whilst you were being the talker? 
 
Student: While she was being the talker. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
298 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Let’s switch it around. The point of the state is not necessarily affecting their 
state whilst they’re doing the talking. Let’s think of it as an interview. I’m the 
interviewer and you’re the interviewee. If I’m going to shift, I still want to 
keep talking of course. I just want you to really consider the ideas that I’m 
coming up with for you. 
 
 
So, the only reason for me to shift in this case is to influence you, but I’m 
influencing you with the rate and the pace at which I’m developing the ideas 
and allowing you to process the ideas at the same rate that I am. Do you feel 
that now? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s it.  
 
Student: Cool. 
 
Igor: 
Very good.  
 
Student: I think we went on a total tangent because I became so interested in what 
David was saying it became an intimate sort of heart-to-heart talk, so we 
completely forgot… 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you here a second? You just did the exercise. What words did 
he use that have an equivalent consciousness state to thoughtful? What was 
the word? Intimate, heart-to-heart. That’s another way of doing the same 
thing. So, you did the same exercise with just a subtle difference. Well done. 
Now you’re beginning to realize that you can do this in many different ways. 
 
Student: Shall I pat myself? 
 
Igor: 
I would. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
And if you don’t do it soon, I’m going to ask everyone else to hug you for that. 
Are there any other comments? 
 
Amir: 
So…

Igor: 
He’s just done it, hasn’t he? Good job. And you said he can’t stop talking. 
 
Amir: 
It’s funny because that kind of answers my question.  
 
Igor: 
I realize that, but for the sake of argument just put it out there so that 
everyone else can learn from your lightning speed mind. 
 
Amir: 
So, in some contexts I have that range but sometimes I’m not paying attention 
to it. I think part of it is because I’m so obsessive with my own thoughts and 
ideas that I’m inside my head and I’m not paying attention to the person in 
front of me. I don’t know how to ask this, but how do you – I think… 
 
Igor: 
By the way, to answer the question, that’s how. 
 
Student: What I had to do with Amir last night was when I wanted him to slow down; I 
would give him some visual clues. I’d glance out, I’d put my finger to my 
mouth and I’d say I wonder what you think about something. Mind you this 
was after about three bottles of wine. It would occasionally slow down. 
 
Igor: 
He can do it. He just did it for us. 
 
Student: I know. Isn’t that amazing? 
 
Igor: 
I know. I’m glad we’ve got it on tape because folks back home won’t believe 
it. 
 
Student: Just to reflect on slowing down in order to communicate better, there is this 
other idea of pacing. So, we have been taught in other courses that if the 
other person is fast, you’ve got to be fast. Otherwise he won’t follow you. If 
he’s slow then you’ve got to be slow. Then he has better rapport, but what we 
are doing is ignore his speed and we bring him down. 
 
Igor: 
That’s not quite true. I’ll use the language that fits him. The concept of pacing 
usually comes in a pair. You pace in order to lead. Does that make you think of 
it slightly differently yet? 
 
Student: Yes and no. It’s always pace and lead, pace and lead. In other words, if the guy 
is fast, you’ve got to be fast first. Then you slow down.

Igor: 
I could not have put it any better than that. That is about as good as I could 
possibly say it.  
 
Student: So, in what we’re learning here, we didn’t use the word pace, going at their 
speed, like they’re saying having a normal conversation. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s put it this way. You’re not a dishwasher. That means you don’t have one 
set speed. You’re allowed to switch it up and down, and if they can’t follow 
along with you, then you know you’ve gone too far too soon. That’s fine. 
That’s just part of normal conversation.  
 
 
Rest assured when we do the next exercise, if you do it with a little bit of 
eloquence – I don’t require any eloquence right now – but once you start 
doing it with a little bit of eloquence, they’ll have no option but to slow down. 
Would you be interested in that element? 
 
 
 
That’s really what the next little exercise is about. It’s very easy. It’s really 
identical to what you just did. You’ll have your normal conversation at 
whatever speed feels appropriate to you. Then you’ll do whatever shift you 
managed to make just now into something more thoughtful, more intimate, 
more heart-to-heart, or however you want to conceive of it. 
 
 
As you make that switch, I’d like you to ask any question that you wish. It 
could be a probing question. It could actually be a mind bending question. 
Just notice how that works. Your job as the interviewee is to listen and not 
concern yourself about the language or the actual nature of the question.  
 
 
Only focus on how they’re asking it and what’s happening and does that seem 
natural to you? That’s it. Of course you’re asking yourself the same question 
as the interviewer. Then you’ll switch roles so that you both get a chance to 
do that. Once you’ve asked your question, it would only be polite to let them 
stew on it for a while before maybe picking up the pace again or not. Do you 
all understand the exercise? Same partner, two minutes apiece, off you go. 
 
 
How was that compared to the others? What did you learn from that? What 
did you gain from that? Hands up. Nothing? Really? Stand up and we’ll get a 
mic to you.

Student: I guess what I noticed was probably her trying to control my pace and the 
little imp in me not wanting to let her do that and speeding up in spite of it, so 
kind of outpacing her maybe. I don’t know why I did that. 
 
Igor: 
Fair enough. 
 
Student: I just seemed to want to do that. 
 
Igor: 
Let me as you this. Of course you knew the pace shift was coming because we 
talked about it. Other than that, was the pace natural or not? 
 
Student: It was very natural and it was fine. 
 
Igor: 
Then that’s fine. You were just having some fun, which I’m quite okay with 
because there’s a place for fun in learning. I agree. Thank you. Are there any 
other comments, questions, insights? Go ahead. 
 
Student: The hard part was we were getting so heart-to-heart and intimate that it was 
difficult to remember to throw something in, and also when I did remember, 
it was quite natural and I couldn’t really tell if Daniella was doing that or not, 
but it was natural throughout. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And I think that’s a function of the intimacy that was there. 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this because this is an important point, and this is a general 
question for all of you by the way. Having done this particular exercise and 
having thrown this question in, in this particular way right now, compared to 
how you’ve been doing these other exercises throughout earlier today and 
yesterday in particular, how will you be doing these exercises differently going 
forwards having had this experience? 
 
Student: I think I’ll be able to be more conscious of something that I already do 
unconsciously and use it more for purpose. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Very good, and I hope you’ve been asking yourselves the same 
question because that wasn’t just for her. You realize that, right? Go ahead.

Student: In the past I found when my subconscious starts to take over in the thinking 
process and I speak it out, I tend to ramble. Now it’s becoming controlled yet 
relaxed at the same time. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. I like those two words together. On their own they may not be 
enough but together they work very, very well. Thank you for that. Are there 
any other comments? Go ahead. 
 
Student: Could you just clarify those last two words that you said. I couldn’t 
understand them. 
 
Igor: 
She said she feels more controlled and relaxed. In the past when she’d been 
letting her unconscious mind just do stuff, she would start rambling, and I 
suspect – I don’t know this for a fact but I’m relatively sure – there will be an 
emotional state which is a little bit more frantic attached to that, whereas 
now it was more controlled and relaxed, so the pace changed with it. 
 
 
Then of course the quality of information changed alongside of that, which is 
very nice to hear. Stand up and we’ll get a mic to you. 
 
Student: This is in response to the person you were talking to just now and to your 
question to all of us. Comparing what we’re doing now to what we were doing 
earlier, frankly what I was doing earlier I’ve almost forgotten already, but 
what comes to my mind is that this is more like I’m learning a strategy. I’m 
getting more strategic in this. Am I on the track on that? 
 
Igor: 
I like what you’re saying if that’s what you’re asking for, but the main 
question is not so much about remembering what you did in the past. It’s 
more you realize that we have more exercises coming forwards. So, after now 
we’ll have more exercises and they’ll be more about these sorts of probing 
questions and so on. 
 
 
The main question is how is the experience you’ve just had going to change 
the quality of the way in which you will ask your probing questions going 
forwards when we do more exercises? That was really the main question. 
 
Student: Oh, okay. I think for me the quality is that I’m slowing down and I guess that 
came from the previous one – the slowing down. I guess that’s getting built in 
and cemented in, in a way.

Igor: 
That’s a very useful thing to do. It’s very useful because then you have the 
range because you know how to communicate the way you’ve done it your 
whole life, and now we’re trying to add some range. I know that for one or 
two of you this is very natural already, in which case it’s just a nice little recap, 
but for a lot of us it’s not. 
 
 
So, you need to expand your range so when it’s time to do Mind Bending 
Language and so on, you get away from the Mind Bending Language that 
some people DO. I’ve got a magic spell.  
 
 
It’s got to be natural. It’s got to be casual. It’s got to be invisible if you want to 
be covert, and this is one of the ways that you can make that happen whilst 
still respecting the need for the mind to shift states right along with it.  
 
Student: I was still thinking about the previous one when I was calibrating myself in this 
deal, and I did notice as I slowed down, I noticed I’m physiologically shifting, 
and I’m just wondering if that’s an intuitive lead or something like that? 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: I would be going down and leaning over and I’m just thinking, how is this 
adding to this? I just wanted to say that. 
 
Igor: 
I agree with you. You’re giving a nonverbal suggestion to the other person on 
how to process it. May I give you an example of what I think you’re referring 
to here? 
 
Student: Sure. You have my permission. 
 
Igor: 
That’s very kind. Thank you. Who are you that’s anything but now everywhere 
but here? Versus who are you… that’s anything but now… only right here? It’s 
the same exact words more or less. With that idea, I hope you’re beginning to 
appreciate that Mind Bending Language is a misnomer. 
 
 
The language is powerful and it has a great deal of use, but really you’re 
creating mind bending moments, which goes beyond language, but uses 
language as a very useful vehicle for that. Does that make sense? Very good. 
Thank you. 
 
Student: What made it make sense was the smile on your face at the very end. It’s like 
hey this guy’s friendly.

Igor: 
Yes, it’s part of the suggestion, right? It’s part of the non-verbals that you 
were mentioning.  
 
Student: What I found was as the person asking the questions – what happened was 
Stefan slowed down beautifully and I didn’t notice it, and then at the end 
after I was doing my bit, I thought I never had a chance to slow down and I 
realized he’d done it for us and I had not even noticed. 
 
 
The other thing that I was aware of was when the pace slowed, as an 
interviewer that pace allowed a stillness of thought. There was space for me 
to watch him and get questions intuitively. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a very useful space to have. It makes finding the right questions and so 
on a lot easier to do. Did you enjoy that? Did you hopefully take something of 
importance from that?  
 
 
 
What I’d like you to do now is to keep everything you just learned in mind for 
the next exercise, and with that thought in mind I’d like to have a volunteer 
please. Can I have a volunteer to have a little chat up here?  
 
Demo: Probing Inferences & Conclusions 
 
Igor: 
Come on up. Give him a round of applause. Have a seat. What’s your name? 
 
Devin: 
Devin. 
 
Igor: 
I like Devin. 
 
Devin: 
Thanks man. 
 
Igor: 
I went to school in Devin. It’s part of England. 
 
Devin: 
Nice. 
 
Igor: 
It’s quite a large county. So, we’ve been talking about Mind Bending Language 
a lot and you’ve had a lot of interactions about that. 
 
Devin: 
Yes.

Igor: 
What kind of things have you learned whilst you were here or maybe even 
before you came here? I don’t know how much exposure you had 
beforehand. 
 
Devin: 
Well, I’ve trained with Amir. I took his Conversational Hypnosis. 
 
Igor: 
Let me pause you. Did you see how easy the context comes out? I apologize. 
I’m just pulling some things out. 
 
Devin: 
Do what you’ve got to do. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Devin: 
Compliance, see that? And I took his NLP course, so I have I guess a brief 
understanding. 
 
Igor: 
And what kind of things have you learned maybe since being here or from 
that? What kind of things do you know about Mind Bending Language? 
 
Devin: 
I do it all the time without knowing it. 
 
Igor: 
What is it? 
 
Devin: 
It would be when you’re really engaged in a conversation with somebody that 
you like and they have the same interests as you. It just flows automatically. 
 
Igor: 
Again, what is it? 
 
Devin: 
It would be like whenever I have a conversation with my instructor on a 
student and all the sudden the time just passes by. That’s what it means. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, good. And how does that relate to this idea of Mind Bending Language 
as a system that we’ve been kind of playing with here and of course on the 
first day as well? 
 
Devin: 
That relates to it because Mind Bending Language is kind of like retraining 
yourself. Like you already know it but you’re bringing it back out, making it 
better, reshaping it, remodeling it and then putting it back in. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
306 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Okay, great. And what is it that you’re pulling out and putting back in? Give 
me some examples of how this works. 
 
Devin: 
The deep inner you – the one that I tend to hide or other people might tend 
to hide – you’re pulling that outside and you’re saying hey I’m a human being, 
this is what I am at the subatomic level, and now what I’m going to do is I’m 
going to show this to everybody and I’m going to bring it back to the top. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, and does that work? 
 
Devin: 
To me, yes. That metaphor works for me, absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
How does it work? How do you know it works?  
 
Devin: 
It’s a feeling.  
 
Igor: 
It’s a feeling. 
 
Devin: 
Right. 
 
Igor: 
So, you get a feeling when you’re pulling it out and that sort of stuff. 
 
Devin: 
Right. 
 
Igor: 
So, whether or not they respond positively, do you still feel that way? 
 
Devin: 
Depending, if they’re not responding positively, then I guess there’s another 
layer to it. 
 
Igor: 
What’s that layer? 
 
Devin: 
I guess uncertainty. 
 
Igor: 
Tell me more. 
 
Devin: 
So, you’re uncertain about that deep inner part of you. It’s like is this me or 
isn’t this me, and what really is me? 
 
Igor: 
Of course we’re here to use Mind Bending Language for influence and so on, 
and this idea of it being you or not being you seems very, very important and 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
307 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
unless I misunderstood you, it related right back to this idea of influencing. Is 
that correct? 
 
Devin: 
Correct. 
 
Igor: 
Is this you or is this not you – how does that relate to the whole influencing 
process? 
 
Devin: 
Again, I don’t think you can influence somebody by being cheap, by being 
somebody that’s fake, that wears a mask. 
 
Igor: 
So, how did you come to that idea or that conclusion? 
 
Devin: 
Experience. 
 
Igor: 
Can you just give me an example? 
 
Devin: 
An example is like somebody is like hey do you like this, and you’re like yeah I 
really love that, it’s awesome, but you really don’t mean it. 
 
Igor: 
And how does that not influence? 
 
Devin: 
Because they feel like well you know he’s just saying that and he really 
doesn’t care. 
 
Igor: 
How do you know? 
 
Devin: 
You can feel it. 
 
Igor: 
So, you can feel other people’s responses? 
 
Devin: 
Correct. 
 
Igor: 
Is that like a psychic thing or something else? 
 
Devin: 
I mean I guess it comes with what I do with martial arts and stuff. When I’m 
doing Jujitsu and stuff and you’re on the ground and you have to feel weight 
shift, feel movement, you really have to be connected with the person. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
308 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
So, if I understand you correctly – to use the martial arts metaphor – because 
you can feel a shift in the weight for example, that feeling actually turns into 
an emotional response that tells you which way something is going. 
 
Devin: 
Right, and which I should go. 
 
Igor: 
And which way you should go to take the dominant position, and if we apply 
that as an analogy to a conversation – and again please correct me if I 
misunderstand this – there is something that you sense from their reactions, 
which translates into a feeling that lets you know whether or not that 
conversation is being as influential as you would like. Is that it? 
 
Devin: 
Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
And you know that because you’ve both had the physical experience in terms 
of the training, and you’ve had the social experience in terms of lots of 
conversations you’ve had before and so on. 
 
Devin: 
Correct. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, great. Let’s take a little timeout here, if I may. What have I been doing? 
The first half was just getting into a little bit of context because we need this 
for what we’re doing now. Any ideas on what kind of probing I’m doing right 
now? Go ahead. 
 
Amir: 
You’re trying to find out how he understands Mind Bending Language and 
how it relates in a relationship with himself and how he processes that. 
 
Igor: 
So, that’s in the specific context. What is the type of probing I’m doing? Was I 
probing for what kind of questions he’s asking himself? Was I particularly 
probing for that at this point? 
 
Amir: 
No, you weren’t asking about himself, but he turned it to himself. 
 
Igor: 
He did, exactly. So, what kind of probing was I doing? 
 
Amir: 
His concepts around it. 
 
Igor: 
Concepts, yes. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
309 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Amir: 
Assumptions, his opinions, his thoughts, the facts. 
 
Igor: 
It’s very related to that level. There’s a slight distinction I’m going to make, 
not because this isn’t true because all this stuff did come out, but a slight 
distinction. 
 
Student: I think you were looking for his decision-making process, his conviction 
process. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly, and I’ll give it to you in a slightly different way in a moment. You’re 
correct and I’ll just let a few other people say something before I use the 
hopefully more elusive obvious version of it.  
 
Student: One thing came for me that came out of him was that you would probably be 
doing the driving questions and answers because he was going into layers, so I 
don’t know if that was… 
 
Igor: 
All of these four things, in fact all the probing questions, will by default bring 
up other information as well. It’s right here in number five. Before I fill it in, I 
want you to have some thoughts about it. You’re correct. All these other four 
are being activated and Jules almost nailed it there. In fact he did nail it. I just 
want to clean it up a little bit, that’s all. Go ahead. 
 
Student: There was some reality testing at some point. 
 
Igor: 
Some reality testing? 
 
Student: Yes. Even those point standings, several times you go to something, you do 
some probing and then you go back to the example and then back. 
 
Igor: 
What do examples do? They make things more real. Remember we talked 
about profiling? Maybe we didn’t but we’re about to. Devin, you nailed it. Is 
Devin more of an abstract thinker or a concrete thinker? What do you think? 
He’s very abstract. 
 
Devin: 
I thought I was concrete. 
 
Igor: 
You did think you were concrete, I know because what you do in terms of 
physical maneuvers and so on is actually a very physical experience, but is 
language is very much abstract. It’s conceptual. He saw the big picture.

Student: He’s rubbing off on me. 
 
Igor: 
The examples were just a way of making sure that his abstractions – that I 
wasn’t hallucinating and I wasn’t putting my fish in his dream. I actually 
understood what he meant. By putting down to an actual example, I can 
combine it with his abstraction, his general principle or his general description 
and realize okay these are the kinds of things he means by that. 
 
 
The kind of thing I’m looking for here – and a couple of you really got it. It’s 
just I want to put it in a slightly different way. I’m testing or I’m probing for 
what kind of inferences and conclusions has he drawn? There’s a difference, 
isn’t there? I’ve had conversations before when I was what we’ll call fake and 
they didn’t work out so well. I’ve had conversations before when I was me or 
more real, just to paraphrase a little bit, and they worked out great.  
 
 
Having had enough of these conversations of both styles, I can infer that it’s 
very likely that being more real will make me more influential. Does that make 
sense? What’s the difference between inferences and conclusions? Does 
anyone have any thoughts on that? Go ahead. 
 
Amir: 
Inferences I’m guessing would be having reference experiences that are 
similar but not directly related to, and they draw upon that information to try 
to draw conclusions; and conclusions is when they’ve stopped thinking and 
they’ve put a statement to a thought. 
 
Igor: 
I see where you’re coming from and you’re correct in essence, except there’s 
a minor distinction I’ll make just because it will be functional for us, but you’re 
correct in essence. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I was just going to say a conclusion seems to come from a direct logical or line 
of evidence, where an inference requires leaps in logic. 
 
Igor: 
You’re 100% right on the money right there. If I tell you one plus one equals 
two, am I correct? Yes? It’s not a trick question by the way. The way a 
conclusion works is it’s a pure process of logic. It’s a mechanical step.  
 
 
If we can agree on what one means, and we can agree on what plus means 
and we can agree on what equals means, then one plus one equals two. It’s a 
fact, unless you and I have different understandings of what a plus means or 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
311 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
what an equals means or what a one means, etc. and that was a numeric 
system. 
 
 
An inference is a very likely fact but you can never quite know. If you’ve spent 
your entire life studying swans and all you ever see are white swans, would it 
be logical for you to conclude that black swans do not exist? Yes or no?  
 
 
The answer believe it or not is no. It’s not a logical conclusion. It is a rational 
inference but unless you’ve seen every single swan in the world that has ever 
existed, is existing right now and will ever exist, you can never conclude that. 
Do you see where I’m going with this? So, conclusion is a matter of fact based 
on premises. Assuming the premises are correct, the result will be correct.  
 
An inference – we usually call it a conclusion but it’s actually an inference. An 
inference is when we have a number of experiences and we extrapolate from 
that a general principle. That general principle is very likely to be true given 
the amount of experiences we’ve had, but it’s not a fact. It’s not a logical fact. 
 
 
Most of our science is drawn from inferences and using the inferences we 
have we can then conclude things from that, but if one of our inferences is 
incorrect, if a black swan did exist, our conclusions suddenly become suspect. 
Do you understand the concept here? 
 
 
This is very, very important in the influencing process because people are 
constantly giving you the result of some internal reasoning process. They 
think they’ve concluded something when they’ve actually inferred it. They 
think it’s a fact when it’s merely a likely fact. It’s only a good candidate for a 
fact. It’s a very probable thing rather than an actual thing. 
 
 
Sometimes they conclude things based on inaccurate information. That’s 
where the assumptions and so on come from. A concept is a conclusion from 
a set of assumptions. If one of those assumptions is incorrect, then it suddenly 
puts the concept in question again. 
 
 
Are you beginning to understand the value of probing for people’s inferences 
and conclusions? Right now of course this is a slightly artificial situation, so I’m 
going right after the inferences. However, let’s say we had a situation where 
he’s concluded something which is not helpful to him. For example, let’s say 
that Devin believed that people hate him.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
312 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Is that a logical conclusion? No. He may well have inferred it from some 
unpleasant experiences, but he could equally infer other things from pleasant 
experiences he’s negated. By knowing this, I can start going backwards and 
ask him how do you know that? How did you conclude that? What are the 
assumptions? What are the experiences?  
 
 
I can challenge it enough so that eventually he has to come to the conclusion 
that thinking that everybody hates him is at the very best just a likely thing, 
not an actual thing, and that’s already given me a little leeway to start 
working with things. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
 
Then I can start deconstructing that even further and further and ultimately 
leading that to a happier outcome and so on. I’m not so interested in actually 
creating new inferences and new conclusions at this point.  
 
 
I’m more interested in probing what inferences and conclusions have 
someone made just to observe them as entities and we can use them in time. 
Do you understand the nature of what we’re doing here? Are there any 
questions on that? Let me just add something here because if we’re doing 
inferences and conclusions, in terms of assessing things, what extra criterion 
for assessing things might we want to include in our list now? 
 
 
Really you can conclude it from number five up there. Procedures? Data? It’s 
true we’ve already got easy, precise and accurate. So, in other words, is the 
information accurate? Is it correct? Is it a fact or is it an opinion. That’s 
another way of judging the accuracy of the information.  
 
 
What I’m thinking of right now – and again it’s just my particular thought and 
you’re welcome to disagree with this – how logical or reasonable are his 
conclusions, are his inferences?  
 
 
 
If he said that everyone hates him based on one unpleasant interaction, is 
that logical or reasonable? No. If it’s based on 100 interactions, is that logical 
or reasonable? More so, this is one of the assessing thoughts you’re going to 
have in the back of your mind because it will help you to determine what your 
next set of questions will be.  
 
 
Where do you want to challenge, if at all? What is going to be some 
interesting places that you can break the shell open in terms of where he’s 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
313 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
stuck and so on? Does that make sense to you? Do you want to add anything 
to that in terms of your experience or are you good? 
 
Student: I’m good. 
 
Igor: 
Give him a round of applause. Thank you.  
 
Do you get the idea of the next exercise? Let’s add one more thing to this 
whole list.  
 
Summarize & Echo 
 
Igor: 
Seeing as it’s relatively easy to think about inferences and conclusions and 
how reasonable or logical it is, what I want you to start doing as well in these 
conversations now is start summarizing or echoing back or reflecting back 
what they’re saying. 
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions – Curious 
2. Non-Judgmental 
3. Validation 
4. Columbo Approach 
5. Pauses 
6. Baby Steps 
7. EQ Reframe/Flattery & Appreciation 
8. Summarize/Echo 
 
 
So, you’re telling me this. Okay, so I hear you saying this. Is that right? Why 
might you want to start doing that? Why might we want to add summarizing 
and echoing into the keys?  
 
Student: Locking them into a position. 
 
Igor: 
It locks them into a position. It checks actually whether or not you’re actually 
correct. It can lock them into a position if you need that in terms of changing 
something and this is just one more way of doing that isn’t it? You’re 
validating and saying oh I get it, I hear where you’re coming from. You’re not 
necessarily correct but I understand where you’re coming from at that level.

Student: It’s a form of a yes set or it helps to build rapport? 
 
Igor: 
It is also a form of a yes set, so it does help build rapport even more, 
absolutely. Did I just do it? Do you feel validated? Go ahead. 
 
Student: If you’re summarizing instead of actually directly echoing, then it verifies that 
you comprehend what they said. 
 
Igor: 
It’s actually very clever what you just did there. You recognized the difference 
between echoing something and summarizing. What is the difference? Do you 
understand the difference? 
 
 
An echo is to repeat exactly back what they just said to you, which is pretty 
much what we just did with Norman. Summarizing is the act of listening 
where you change the words into your own words and that gives you one 
little advantage that most people don’t think about. 
 
 
Would you like to know what that is? Reframing. You can summarize it 
differently to what they’ve said, including a little reframe, and they’ll say oh 
yeah that’s what I meant, only they didn’t until they heard you say it. Do you 
understand the value of that? Thank you. That was a very smart distinction to 
make.  
 
Student: I’m not sure if I’m correct about this but what I noticed was when we were 
doing the inferencing compared to the conclusion. There was an emotion that 
arose during each of the conclusions. 
 
Igor: 
We tend to be very married to our conclusions. People tend to be very 
attached to their conclusions, absolutely. 
 
Student: And when he was talking about the references, it didn’t activate anything 
internally, which means that it didn’t have as much meaning as the conclusion 
would have as a focus that we can use to get that across. 
 
Igor: 
In this case you’re correct. In many cases you’ll be correct. In some cases it’s 
the background experiences that are actually more important that the 
conclusion – just to give you some variety on that. So, do you understand 
what the next exercise will be? No? You’ll get there.

Student: A quick question. On these exercises that we just did with inferences and 
conclusions, it seemed a little bit like strategy elicitation as applied to how 
people form opinions or points of view, but perhaps not quite. I’m wondering 
maybe strategy elicitation might not be on the list because it’s harder to 
maintain rapport with strategy elicitation. 
 
Igor: 
The only reason strategy elicitation is not on this list is because that’s a 
particular NLP terminology, and that would require me to go into the whole 
NLP model of the world shall we say, and that’s not what we’re doing here. 
 
 
If it helps you to think of that in those terms, by all means do so. I’m just 
thinking on a simplistic level – how did they come to that conclusion? Is it 
actually a logical conclusion or is there a flaw in their logic, which gives me 
one approach? Is it actually an inference based on experiences that can never 
have a full conclusion, which gives me another approach in terms of loosening 
up the way they’re attached to the idea?  
 
 
If it helps you to think of that in terms of strategies, by all means do so but 
we’re not going down that road because it means too many different things 
for us to make it useful here. 
 
Student: If summarizing is using our words and echoing is using their words, does it 
make any difference whether we’re using their words or our words when 
you’re guiding them into trance? 
 
Igor: 
Why don’t you find out? I’m serious. The best recipe to answer these 
questions is with actual experience. I’ll happily give you an opinion during the 
break, but it goes beyond what we’re doing at this point. Right now just try 
both of them in terms of your conversations and notice what the effects are.  
 
 
The exercise is very simple. It’s like we did all day yesterday and then some 
portions of today. Get into groups of three – A, B and C. A will ask a question, 
B will be answering and C will just see what’s going on. What kind of probing 
questions will you be focusing on? Was that psychologically leading or 
logically leading? Are you beginning to get a sense of the difference?  
 
 
So, get yourselves into groups of three. Put your hands up in the air to find 
someone and only put it down when you’ve found someone. Then we’ll start 
you all off at the same time.

Welcome back. How was the exercise? Who wants to have a little chat about 
what you discovered with that? Of course you do, Amir. Come on up. I will be 
shocked the day that your hand doesn’t go up. 
 
Amir: 
I’m trying to hold it down. 
 
Igor: 
No, don’t do that. 
 
Amir: 
On purpose when I was summarizing, I was changing what the other person 
was saying in a more positive way to see if they would accept it, and I changed 
a few things and I saw him nodding and grinning, and then I kind of pushed it 
too far and then he said no and he corrected me. 
 
Igor: 
What’s the lesson from that? 
 
Amir: 
The lesson is, don’t push too much.  You can start to suggest slowly to see if 
they’re following you and if they’re not, take their feedback, understand 
where it is they’re coming from and then more baby steps. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. I agree with everyone you said, except consider the possibility that 
sometimes pushing too much can be incredibly useful, but we’re not there 
yet. 
 
Student: I was just about to say that that gives another opportunity to reframe. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Go ahead. 
 
Student: Actually I was quite confused looking at all the keys that you put up on the 
board for being influential because it’s exactly the list that we are teaching 
mediators how to be neutral and impartial and stay in the middle between 
parties, so I was actually spinning a little bit about those ideas. 
 
 
Then I had the conversation with Gregory and I had a lot of thoughts in my 
mind how to make sense out of that because they are two quite different 
concepts, and the way he was asking questions, I think I’m on the verge of 
getting a real good thought, on the tip of your tongue. It’s not there quite yet 
but I really felt a lot of spin by him asking a lot of these questions about 
inferences and conclusions and how did he get there?

Igor: 
Believe it or not we haven’t got into the influencing process yet. Right now 
we’re still on the fact-finding mission, getting inside someone’s mind and 
finding out what’s really there. How many of you are noticing that even 
though you’re just technically fact-finding, stuff is shifting already? Things are 
changing. You’re being spun out into thoughts.  
 
 
Sometimes more important ideas arise and sometimes you actually change 
your mind about an idea. It’s like you know what, for some reason I always 
that but you’re right, this doesn’t quite fit. I think this is probably more likely. 
 
 
Who’s finding that sort of stuff happening? Just keep that in the back of your 
mind because this will become very important when we actually get into the 
influencing processes.  
 
 
Right now we’re just developing a very rich repertoire of background skills 
that will allow us to then build up a very influential palette, but the 
foundation is the key. Thank you for that. What else did you notice, 
experience, learn or discover? 
 
Student: What I found is I can see the screen quite well and I remembered the 
summarizing part and so I used that quite a bit. Then if it wasn’t on the board, 
I couldn’t remember the words, so I was really lost in getting something. 
 
Igor: 
Getting something in what way? 
 
Student: Well, I just kept summarizing a lot and then asked questions I thought I would 
do and then I think I summarized more than anything else because I couldn’t 
do it verbatim anyway. 
 
Igor: 
What I’m curious about is what is it that you were summarizing? Are you 
summarizing the same thing or are you asking questions to get information to 
be able to summarize it? 
 
Student: Well, I summarized it because I didn’t know what else to do but from that I 
got things that were said. I could go on from there. 
 
Igor: 
So, you summarized something. They said something and you summarized it 
for them. Then what happened? 
 
Student: Then I went from where they were there hopefully.

Igor: 
Where did you go from there? Did you ask a question? 
 
Student: I asked a question, yes, and then took it to somewhere else.  
 
Igor: 
If I understand you correctly, they said something, you summarized it and 
based on that summary, you asked a follow-up question. They said something 
more and you did some more summarizing and that process continued. Is that 
correct? 
 
Student: Yes, that’s basically what the whole thing was for me. 
 
Igor: 
How did you know which questions to ask? 
 
Student: Because they brought something new up or they expanded on something I’d 
summarized or I tried to pick out. 
 
Igor: 
Really you’re doing all this already. You’re already probing because if you’re 
not probing, how can you have any material worth summarizing? The only 
thing you may or may not have done – I don’t know yet, I’d have to ask a little 
bit further but it’s really of minor importance right now – is whether any of 
your probing focused on what kind of ideas they conclude, what kind of things 
they inferred from their experiences in life and so on? 
 
 
I don’t know if you did that or not. It matters very little because you’ll have 
another chance to do all this stuff anyways. If you did, then you did the 
exercise and being confused was just an added bonus.  
 
 
If you didn’t, then you still did really the whole process that we’re talking 
about. It’s just the next time you can put more emphasis on finding inferences 
and conclusions. That’s all. It’s a very simple small step. Thank you. 
 
Student: I may be jumping the gun a little but I stuck in a mind bending sentence. I saw 
the wheels clicking more and I had no reason and no idea why I just did that.  
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this. What was the quality of the information that came out 
after his clicking and whirring subsided? 
 
Student: It was pretty much when you told us to switch, so not much came after that 
unfortunately. I felt like I should have had a command, a suggestion, 
something to put in there. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
319 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Tell me more. What is it that makes you think that? 
 
Student: That’s my idea of the purpose of the course. 
 
Igor: 
The purpose of the course is to give someone a suggestion? 
 
Student: Or something to influence them – at that point a command, a suggestion, an 
idea. 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this then. What makes you think that asking a question isn’t 
influential? 
 
Student: It can be but as I understand it, that particular question or the mechanics of 
that question is to trip up the brain to open it to the possibility of your 
suggestion. 
 
Igor: 
And what makes you think that? 
 
Student: From what you’ve told me so far. 
 
Igor: 
Have I? 
 
Student: I thought you did. 
 
Igor: 
What if you reexamined what I’ve told you?  
 
Student: I’m pretty sure I’m going to go do that now. 
 
Igor: 
I would encourage that. Did you all hear an inference that he thought was a 
conclusion that he’s now reexamining and has been influenced without a 
single suggestion or idea being presented, except of course now? 
 
 
Do you understand a more expanded frame now in terms of how and when 
you can add ideas and suggestions and when you don’t need to, or is that 
something you still want to consider a bit further? 
 
Student: Definitely. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, keep doing that.

Student: I just want to thank Charlie because at the end of that process, I figured I’d 
kind of made a mistake because we ran out of time and I never got to the 
summary and the echo part. I thought oh well, I’ve blown that one.  
 
 
Then Charlie was saying how he summarized during the process. I thought 
well actually I did that too because I was asking questions and I think I asked 
about something or another, and then I said it’s like music to your ears, which 
is a summary in my words of what he just said.  
 
 
So, I was actually doing it and I didn’t realize I’d been doing that until he spoke 
up. So, I want to acknowledge Charlie and also the value of having the 
feedback so that I don’t live my doo-doo. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. By the way, that’s actually a very nice realization to make, which is 
most of the time when you think you’ve made a mistake, just check your 
assumptions. In my experience – and you may have noticed I’ve done a lot of 
teaching so far – 99% of the time when people think they’ve made a mistake, 
all that they’ve made is an assumption.  
 
 
To coin a cheesy phrase, if you assume too much – do you know where I’m 
going with this? So, I’ll just say it. You make an ass of you and me, and I’m not 
an ass, so stop it! Thank you for that. That’s a great realization to have. Go 
ahead, Arthur. 
 
Arthur: 
I’d just like to understand the categories – probing questions, assessing 
thoughts, and the key things. If you’re doing a probing question and if you’re 
doing all of the key elements, what’s the importance of the whole group of 
assessing thoughts and thinking? 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this in return. What might be a purpose of assessing as you’re 
going along? This is what you’re doing. You’re asking questions out loud. This 
is what happens in the outside world. And this all happens in the inside world. 
This of course is actually happening in the outside world. You’re actually doing 
it partially internally, but it’s just going to affect the probing questions. 
 
 
Let’s turn to this, which is what your question is about. What might be 
important about asking yourself these questions as you’re going along? 
 
Arthur: 
I suppose that if you asked a question and all the sudden the person burst out 
crying, you could say boy that seems to be affecting you in a powerful way.

Igor: 
And then what? 
 
Arthur: 
Well, you could go on from there. You could say why or what’s happening? 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, you’ve just used number five here in terms of assessing. How did 
what you just did help the interaction continue forward? How did it smooth 
things out? 
 
Arthur: 
You recognized, you validated the experience they were having, you 
recognized it and then you led on from that. 
 
Igor: 
So, the magic word I heard you say was recognized. Did this assessing stuff 
help you recognize something that was occurring?  
 
Arthur: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And did that alter your next follow-up response? 
 
Arthur: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, do you have a sense of what this is for now? 
 
Arthur: 
I knew what it was for. I guess the question was sort of a view of in terms of 
the relative importance of the groups. I was sort of thinking maybe that’s kind 
of a smaller group. How precise and accurate they are, how clear and concise.  
 
 
I mean if somebody is talking to you, you still can deal with them if they’re not 
exactly clear and concise or if they’re not exactly precise and accurate. You 
still continue the things if the things they’re telling you are fact, opinion, and 
judgment. 
 
Igor: 
You’ll still continue but the question that I have for you is how do you know 
where to continue, which way to go? If on the other hand you’re thinking of 
these things here and you find someone’s being very unclear, would you 
continue just asking random questions, or would you be curious about that 
un-clarity and see if you can investigate that further? 
 
Arthur: 
Yes, totally if I had the presence of mind to be able to do that.

Igor: 
That’s right. So, change that title assessing thoughts and thinking to presence 
of mind. That’s all it’s there for. That is where your strategy comes from. Was 
that useful? 
 
Student: I think this particular exercise kind of invites the interviewee to just talk away, 
so what I found challenging was when and where to interrupt. Do you have 
any thoughts about how to do that better? 
 
Igor: 
What was your experience? What did you do? 
 
Student: I didn’t interrupt. I made him finish and then I summarized what he said, but it 
was challenging for me to summarize because there was too much 
information. 
 
Igor: 
How did you feel in the interaction when there was so much stuff for you to 
summarize that it would have taken you a half an hour to do so? Was that 
pleasant or unpleasant overall? 
 
Student: It was very unpleasant and I thought I’m losing some of it. 
 
Igor: 
So, taking that feeling of unpleasantness as your barometer, if you were to 
rehearse that situation again in your mind, the same scenario, what would 
you need to do differently so that you would feel pleasant at the point of 
summary rather than unpleasant? 
 
Student: To trust that I’ve got it all. 
 
Igor: 
You can either trust that you got it all – in other words you still let him ramble 
for the whole thing and then summarize it. What else could you do? 
 
Student: I should have interrupted. 
 
Igor: 
And if you did interrupt, at what point do you think would have been 
appropriate? I won’t know because I don’t know the conversation, but just 
run through that scenario inside your mind. 
 
Student: I thought I knew where to interrupt. I just couldn’t. I realized it after.

Igor: 
If I understand you correctly, your question isn’t so much how to know when 
to interrupt. It’s more a question of how to interrupt when you know it’s time. 
Is that the question? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, perfect. Allow me to interrupt you for a second. You just said something 
very interesting there. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And that’s one. What happens after one?  
 
Student: The next interruption. 
 
Igor: 
There are many different ways to do it. That’s what I’m suggesting. Does that 
help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: I just want to go back to Arthur’s question and share how it worked for me 
because I also had kind of a hesitation about it, and then I came up with this 
visual analogy of a terrain that has like several ways to go and depending on 
the light that was catching it to the big one. 
 
Igor: 
I think that’s an excellent analogy. Did you like that analogy? Yes, this is just 
your map that tells you it’s time to change path, or not. 
 
Student: It gives you options of which way to explore it further. 
 
Igor: 
I love that analogy. That’s a nice analogy. Okay, I think we got something of 
value out of that. Would that be fair to say? I think what would be really 
valuable at this point is to have a break. Let’s take 15 minutes.

DVD 10 – How To Use Key MBL Techniques In 
Your Daily Communication & Present Yourself 
As An Undisputed Authority Figure With 
“Echoing” 
 
 
 
Keys To Influential Communication 
 
Igor: 
Let’s start up again. In the spirit of what we’ve been doing here so far, let me 
ask you a question. This may or may not require some thinking from you, 
although you might have a useful thought already. 
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions – Curious 
2. Non-Judgmental 
3. Validation 
4. Columbo Approach 
5. Pauses 
6. Baby Steps 
7. EQ Reframe/Flattery & Appreciation 
8. Summarize/Echo 
 
 
Are these keys only useful in Mind Bending Language when you use Mind 
Bending Language? What do you think? Do you think they might be useful in 
other situations and contexts too; in life in general; as a hypnotist in general 
whether you’re overt, cover, direct, indirect, Ericksonian or otherwise? 
 
 
These are generally important principles for communication in general. In fact 
they’re influential principles and if you think about it all hypnosis is a form of 
influence, isn’t it? All therapy is a form of influence.  
 
 
I had a discussion with one of the assistants earlier today. He came up with 
the realization that influence is like the big category and then you have all 
these examples of influence:

 Therapy 
 Sales 
 Coaching 
 Teaching 
 Training 
 
 
What is influence a subcategory of? This is not the right answer or the wrong 
answer. I’ll just share my opinion on this matter, if you’d like.  
 
Student: Communication. 
 
Igor: 
Communication, yes. What else do you guys have? 
 
Student: I think it’s respect. 
 
Igor: 
Respect is very important. What else? 
 
Student: I think you can use it for control. 
 
Igor: 
You can use it for control.  
 
Student: I’d say it’s a subcategory of interaction. 
 
Igor: 
I would 100% agree with that.  
 
Student: I think influence is a subcategory of life. 
 
Igor: 
On a huge scale, 100%. I’ll put something in parallel with life, which I think in 
terms of human life as opposed to life as we know it. 
 
Student: I think it’s about expressing yourself honestly. 
 
Igor: 
I agree and I think it’s very important. Allow me to present you with one 
particular idea that may or may not be useful to you, but it has been very 
useful to me. All influence and all the subcategories from training to therapy 
and all the rest of it are just examples of a learning process.  
 
 
When you communicate with someone, are they not learning something?  
 
When you’re being honest with people, are they not learning something?  
 
When you’re making a sale, are they not supposed to be learning something?  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
326 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
When you’re training someone, are they not learning something?  
 
When you do therapy, are they not learning something? 
 
 
That’s just an idea to think about because then you can look at what the 
learning process is and there’s one thing that sets mankind apart from pretty 
much every other animal on the planet, and that’s our capacity to learn. If you 
think of it in those terms, we are born to be influenced, which means 
becoming influential is actually much easier than we think. Whenever you 
think you’re not being influential, you actually are.  
 
 
You’re just teaching them a different lesson than the one you want. They’re 
learning something other than what you had hoped they’d be learning. That’s 
when education comes in very handy, right? We coming to the end of the day 
now, the last session, and we’re getting past the halfway point of this 
particular training and we’ve almost completed our lists, which is great 
because then we can actually start using them for learning influence, if that is 
not a tautology.  
 
 
What I’d like to do now is another exercise – A, B and C and so on – only we’re 
going to do this one a little bit differently. This exercise is going to require you 
to do some thinking. No, surely not! Where is the spoon to feed me? I assure 
you it will be a very easy exercise with only a small amount of thinking, but I 
do want you to start taking responsibility for your thinking now, especially 
when it relates to all these things here.  
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
5. Inferences & Conclusions 
6. Implications & Consequences 
 
 
The final category flows seamlessly from the previous one. If people make 
certain inferences and conclusions, there are always further conclusions that 
can be drawn from that. In other words, there will be consequences to that.  
 
 
A wonderful place to influence people is when they realize that the ideas or 
the conclusions that they’re attached to lead to consequences they really 
don’t want. I’ll give you an example of that, but I won’t give you a

demonstration because I want you to actually go in and do it rather than 
follow a demonstration. 
 
 
I will give you an example so that you have an idea of what I’m talking about 
here. I came across a very interesting teacher. I actually really like him 
because he is an educator and he focuses on these sorts of principles in 
teaching, which is why I found him of course. 
 
 
He tells a really funny charming story about teaching – I think it’s fifth grade. I 
don’t even know what the grades mean in North America, but it’s younger 
kids. He’s talking to them about ethics, and one of the questions he uses to 
explore ethics is, is it okay to cancel a date? When is it okay to cancel a date 
you have with someone?  
 
 
Normally kids say it’s okay. You have to be honest with people, but sometimes 
you have to cancel it because maybe something more important is happening, 
like your auntie just died and the family needs you or whatever. They come 
up with all these questions. It’s an interesting way of interacting with ethics. 
 
 
One particular year, he came across a very interesting class and this coincided 
with a particular political scandal – I think it was in North America – which I 
know will really shock and surprise you. It revolved around whether or not 
you were being told the truth by a politician. I know it’s surprising, isn’t it? 
People were shocked that a particular politician had not told the truth.  
 
 
As a result, he asked these kids when can you break a date, and they said 
anytime provided you’re being honest about it. If you don’t want to go, you 
have to be honest about it and not go and take the consequences.  
 
 
He tried every kind of question imaginable to see if they could shake their 
rigid attachment to that idea to the point of saying is it okay to make commit 
murder? They said sure, if you want to commit, you can do it. You just have to 
take the consequences.  
 
 
So, they really were attached to an idea. They were stuck on an idea. This is 
where your thinking begins, by the way. He could not shake that idea from 
them, but as an educator he realized that they had just hit a dead end, a blind 
alley, and that’s not useful for children. That’s actually not useful for anyone, 
but in this case in particular. They stopped thinking about ethical implications.

Being a rather smart educator, he let a few days go by so they would forget 
about it. They came back on Friday – it’s important that it was a Friday. It’s 
the last session of the day, so they’re a little bit tired and fragile anyways, and 
he tells them there’s going to be an exam today. 
 
 
They go what? Didn’t you say that we weren’t going to have any exams until 
the end of the year? He said oh I changed my mind. They got a little bit 
grumpy but they go all right. They get their books out and started getting 
ready. He really makes a ham out of it. He’s just getting them all ready for the 
exam. They’re not particularly happy, but they’re accepting it. He just changed 
his mind.  
 
 
Then he stops and says oh I’m only kidding, you don’t have an exam today. 
They go what? He says there’s no exam. I just felt like fooling with you. They 
were livid. What are you doing? You get us all fired up and all excited. You 
can’t do that. Then he reminded them of their conclusions from a few days 
ago – but I thought you said just a few days ago that if you felt like doing 
something that you had to be honest and do it as long as you could take the 
consequences. I felt like messing with your minds and telling you that you 
have an exam when you didn’t, so I did it. 
 
 
Of a class of 20 children, 18 changed their mind on the spot. The other two 
didn’t last long. Do you now understand the importance of probing for 
implications and consequences? We’re going to do the same exercise again – 
the A, B, C style of exercise – only this time because of the nature of 
implication and consequences, you’re going to go back to number five – the 
inferences and conclusions – and start with that and get the ball rolling.  
 
 
Let’s do it this way. It’s probably easiest. Go back to the groups you just had a 
moment ago because you already know the ballpark that you’re dealing with. 
Go back to talking about inferences and conclusions and so on, and then start 
probing for what are the inferences or the implications and consequences.  
 
 
A consequence is a fact, something that must happen. An implication means 
it’s not actually an event that must happen, but it means something that 
people may be surprised by. Do you understand the difference between the 
two? 
 
 
The consequences for the children was that the teacher could mess with their 
minds anytime he wanted to and pretend to have an exam when there wasn’t

one coming and give them that emotional roller coaster. The implications 
were that he could do that. The consequences were that he did do that. Do 
you understand the difference? 
 
 
The implications of saying you’ve got to be honest at all times are I can do 
something like I can slap you, I can shoot you, I can pretend to have an exam 
and take it away, I can torture you mentally, I can be cruel in any way I want. 
Those are all the implications. 
 
 
When he actually did one of those things, it is actually a consequence of the 
position that they locked themselves into. Do you understand the idea? That’s 
really all I want you to add to this. It’s really the same exercise you did a 
moment ago, the same stuff you did a moment ago. Go with it. Just get 
yourselves back into that sort of mode again. 
 
 
All I want you to do once you get to that point is pursue what implications and 
consequences – pleasant and unpleasant, it can go both ways – the 
conclusions and inferences they have drawn would naturally lead towards. 
Easy?  
 
 
You can just wonder out loud what the consequences of that idea might be. 
It’s just another little device, like I wonder if this means that. With the 
children for example, I wonder if it means I could mentally torture you for the 
rest of the term just because I felt like it? That would be the honest response 
wouldn’t it. So, that’s an extra little device you can put in there if you want to. 
It’s a minor thing, so you don’t have to but seeing as we’re here anyway you 
might as well. Let’s go back to here again. That’s really what you’re focusing 
on, and everything else is a bonus. Are you ready to start? Four minutes 
apiece, off you go. 
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
How did the exercise go? What kind of stuff did you get from this exercise? 
Eloquence? Seriously, what kind of things did you get from this? How was this 
exercise, with the implications following from the conclusions, different from 
just doing the conclusions earlier on?

Student: We tried something really interesting because Peter was tired of speaking 
English because it was draining him, so I said let me observe you guys 
speaking in Polish. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, because they’re both Polish. 
 
Student: I almost observed more because the words weren’t distracting me. It was 
such a great experience. 
 
Igor: 
Good job. That’s actually very worthwhile doing. Another place you can do 
this is if you’re watching TV, especially anything that has a live situation, turn 
the sound off. You see a lot then. 
 
Student: It was really interesting. I could see the shifts in real time. 
 
Igor: 
Right. You may not be able to tell whether it’s clear and concise and so on, 
but you can tell about emotional responses quite dramatically, right? 
 
Student: Very dramatic. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. Thank you. 
 
Student: I highly recommend it. 
 
Student: For me the implications and consequences was a wonderful closure, and at 
the end of that it’s just like at choice point. I can see the consequences and 
this is not my decision to what’s going to go on here, but it’s clearly given a 
closure for the person to make a choice along this road. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. That’s a really nice way of putting it. There’s another thing you can 
do with that by the way. With that closure, you can actually go the opposite 
way and open things up again.  
 
 
This is part of people not thinking things through properly and just having 
thoughts, because if they come to a conclusion with consequences they don’t 
like – in other words whose consequences clash with some previous 
assumption or value or a particular motivation or purpose – then when you 
expose that flaw to them, they will have a massive mind bending moment.

We had a great example right here with Devin. Remember Devin was saying 
he was taught the sort of taking control context and setting my mind and I 
love giving my opinion to people, but I want to learn something else. So, 
there’s a value there, right?  
 
 
We explored that value or purpose further and found out the whole thing 
with the kids to open their minds up. Can you remember what happened 
when we exposed Devin to basically the flaw in his logic, which is to say he 
wants kids who feel supported and have an open mind, yet he’s using a 
communication style that has the opposite effect? 
 
 
Did you notice the rather dramatic shift at that point? Devin, do you mind 
taking the mic and having a chat about that? What did it feel like from the 
inside at that point when we just put that together? 
 
Devin: 
Like worlds colliding. It’s the best way I can say it. I’m learning there are 
different dimensions to all these questions. It’s like there are different 
dimensions inside of me and every time you asked a different question like 
with implications and consequences, something else just pulled up, something 
else is pulled up. It’s kind of like shaking up a snow globe. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a great metaphor for that. That’s a mind bending moment really, isn’t 
it? Hopefully you all noticed it and definitely you felt it, how quickly your 
attitudes readjust and suddenly you come up with new ideas and new ways of 
doing things. 
 
Devin: 
Instant. 
 
Igor: 
Instant, and that’s the power of going the opposite way with the implications. 
You can go for closure, which is great, or we get a different kind of closure. 
We actually opened things up again so that a new path that was previously 
closed off gets reopened.  
 
Student: A new file.  
 
Igor: 
A new file. Thank you. That’s a great way of putting it. Thank you for that. 
 
Devin: 
Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Amir, did you want to add something? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
332 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Amir: 
Yes, it seems like for the consequences, it almost looks like you’re taking the 
process that they’re doing and putting a different frame on it to kind of give it 
a better perspective because in one frame it may look okay, but in a different 
frame it may not.  
 
 
If it’s a useful one, then you can kind of generalize it into a lot frames, and 
that becomes powerful for them and if it isn’t then they quickly realize it. It 
motivates them to change it. They go oh no, this is not good in other areas.  
 
Igor: 
What you’re talking about here now is actually a follow-on from what Devin 
experienced, which is all of these probing questions, the information that 
comes up – and this is where the value assessing stuff comes from, especially 
the level five, the emotional response. 
 
 
There is a hierarchy of attachment – in other words what’s important. In 
Devin’s case just because it’s a nice dramatic version of it, it was more 
important – and by the way notice how I actually cheated a bit. I did and I’m 
sorry. I did a little psychological leading.  
 
 
I stuck with the children because there’s a whole range of assumptions and 
conclusions about children that we have as a society – their need for 
protection and so on – that I’m going to use in my favor in terms of helping 
him to get where he wanted to go.  
 
 
It’s more predictable for me to know that he’s going to come to the idea that 
children need to have their minds open, to be supported, to learn to think 
about the world and so on. 
 
 
There are very few people, who think that children need to be taught to be 
closed-minded, or they need to shut up and listen or they need to be told to 
do. Some people do but most people have a different value set.  
 
 
So, I had a pretty good chance that I could use that leverage to counter-
balance the imposing your opinion mentality that he was struggling with at 
that point.  
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? I was definitely leading at that point, 
but I’m using the questions to allow him to use the flaw in the conflict, to 
collapse the conflict in a way that’s going to be positive – in other words in 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
333 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
the direction that he asked for, which is to have the option of being more this 
style of question and more softer questioning than presenting just his pure 
opinion. 
 
 
This is the important part because we’re now getting into the influencing 
cycles themselves. Devin let me ask you this. Can you still give your opinion to 
people? 
 
Devin: 
Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
And is it still enjoyable at times? 
 
Devin: 
Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
Do you believe him? Absolutely. However, do you now have a sense that you 
have a choice to change – in other words to have a different style – when 
circumstances demand? 
 
Devin: 
Yes, 100%. 
 
Igor: 
So, have I influenced him? Yes. Have I taken choices away from him? No. Is 
there a win-win at this point? To me it’s less relevant whether or not he 
actually does this. It doesn’t affect me as such, but if he came to me as a 
coach or a therapist, that’s the outcome that I’m supposed to help him with.  
 
 
The point is the influencing style that I’m promoting here is the one that does 
create a win-win. It’s the one where I don’t have to close down all his options 
just so there’s one left and that’s the one I want him to take.  
 
 
So, I’m not going to clear the room out so that there’s only a choice of one in 
this style of influencing. I want to create more options in the full knowledge 
that I can make the option that I would him to influence with – in this case to 
ask other styles of questions – so attractive that it supersedes the 
alternatives. 
 
 
So, now you can have times when you just give your opinion because you 
enjoy it, and at other times he’s perfectly free to back that off and put 
something else in place and be more influential with those things, and that’s 
called choice and that’s a wonderful place to be.

If we did more of these interactions, chances are at some point Devin would 
come up and say thank you so much for changing my mind. That’s how you 
get people to actually be grateful to you for having influenced them, and 
that’s a really powerful place to be. That builds a very powerful relationship. 
Thanks for that. 
 
Student: Just for me, my opinion I guess, adding this level of implications and 
consequences type questions, it went way beyond everything else we were 
doing and it took this to a whole new level. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: It opened up all the doors in one shot, and not only for the person getting 
questioned but for the person doing the questioning. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, you saw that whole counter-influence thing where both people 
grow as a result of the interaction, right? 
 
Student: It just rounded everything up and it’s a good place to be. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. I’m very glad to hear it. Now of course you realize it won’t always 
be the case. It happened to be it here. I want to make sure you realize that at 
any interaction, any one of these six styles of probing questions may hold the 
key or the secret to the influence. There are a couple of places that will be 
more likely than others. 
 
 
For example, motivation and purpose will tend to be a really strong 
contender. Inferences and conclusions, implications and consequences are 
basically twins. They’re like Siamese twins. They share a hip but not a brain. 
These are also very powerful places.  
 
 
The rest could be the difference that makes the total change, but the other 
three tend to be the ones that have the most juice in them. It’s just my 
experience. Yours may vary but you’re welcome to my opinion. 
 
Student: The implications and consequences basically, I found that at that point in time 
you have to be in agreement or disagreement with your conclusions and also 
the concepts, opinions, thoughts and facts. If you’re not in agreement, then 
you’re not done yet. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
335 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
How do you mean be in agreement? Give me a specific example of what you 
mean. 
 
Student: Well, if the potential consequence that you mention is not in agreement with 
the conclusion that you came up with… 
 
Igor: 
Oh, I see. There’s a conflict. There’s a logical inconsistency, right? Like the 
kids, they can conclude that you can do anything you want as long as you’re 
honest, and they had the consequences of being mentally tortured by their 
teacher, which they didn’t like.  
 
 
There is an inconsistency, like I suddenly don’t like what believing you can do 
anything you want as long as you’re honest about it – I don’t like the 
consequence of that, and that’s an emotional dissonance and that forces a re-
alignment. 
 
Student: Yes, it’s almost like a way of measuring are you on or are you not on? If you’re 
not on, you have to continue. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. I agree. This is exactly what happened with Devin. That’s when the 
collapse happened. That’s when the change occurred because one was so 
important that it overpowered the other and actually allowed the doors to 
open up. It’s a very useful place to be. I agree with that. So, I guess we’re 
done. Are there any other comments? 
 
Student: So, on some level they experienced those doors being opened and they 
experienced that kind of change and they realized the logical inconsistencies 
and as a result they have that moment of connecting how they feel with what 
they’re thinking. 
 
Igor: 
As long as it’s done in the right frame of all the other stuff we’ve been doing, 
yes. 
 
Student: Could there be other times where their state will change all of that, what 
they’re thinking and believing and feeling? 
 
Igor: 
How do you mean? 
 
Student: Say you work with this person, you get to this level where they realize – let 
me get a specific context. You get this person where they realize that doing X

event is in no way, shape or form useful for them, and they realize that and 
they feel that they shouldn’t, and they have a higher motivation which drives 
them not to do that behavior anymore. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Student: Then they feel in another way later on, like when you’re not around, and then 
it kind of changes what’s important to them at that time and as a result go 
back to the old behavior, and as a result how does the influence - I guess the 
real question is – last in a way where they keep and maintain. 
 
Igor: 
I understand. Here’s the difference. The difference comes from where did the 
insight of that conflict come? Is that a conscious insight or an unconscious 
one?  
 
 
A conscious insight can come from a process of indoctrination or 
psychological leading. Let’s assume I did none of that other conversation. He 
says he wants to be more open and I happen to know he works with kids, and 
I’ll say okay can you see that when you’re just telling people your opinion, 
well then the kids’ minds won’t be opened? I’ve just directly confronted him 
with the logical inconsistency, correct? 
 
Student: Consciously. 
 
Igor: 
Consciously. The problem is he’s done no processing, so now my most likely 
outcome will be a defense mechanism, which given that he has trained in the 
combative arts, may include violence. 
 
 
The conscious mind is very fragile and we do not enjoy having our flaws 
pointed out to us. So, it’s not the conscious change that is of interest to me 
because he can acknowledge the conflict – and a lot of people do that. If you 
want to have a classic example of a whole category of people whose 
conscious insight totally conflicts with their behavior, talk to smokers. 
 
 
Ninety percent of them will tell you it’s a dirty habit, it’s a bad habit, I hate it, I 
wish I wasn’t doing it, but they continue doing it. So, there’s a conscious 
insight that never reached the unconscious behavior.  
 
 
What we did here was different. Remember, psychologically leading is the 
weakest of the three styles of questions. Indoctrination is the weakest of all. It 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
337 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
requires a huge amount of reinforcement for it to work. There are some 
concepts in our society that are reinforced in that way but that’s another 
story. 
 
 
Psychologically leading is the next layer after indoctrination. It’s faster but 
again its stickiness is less. Logically leading, provided someone is emotionally 
being taken care of so that there are no emotional reactions that are blocking 
things, that is going to create a very strong change. 
 
 
If you want to see how that works, look at the works of Socrates, or actually 
Plato who wrote about him. You will see two clear reactions. Those that just 
hated him because he could destroy their position and they hated him for it 
and got very upset and left – it’s nicely documented – and those that went 
you’re so right.  
 
 
So, with logically leading you run a risk that it can go either way. When it goes 
one way, it will probably stick. If you go the other way, then you may well get 
the jujitsu violence that we appall, unless of course you’re paying for it, in 
which case we love it. 
 
 
Intuitive leading – that’s the one where personally in my experience you have 
a transformation that sticks because they connected the dots. I didn’t say very 
much. Devin had to connect the dots. I had to gently lead him to the point 
where the pressure was strong enough that it leap across and actually make 
that conclusion, which he did. 
 
 
The best answer is really sitting right next to you right there because he’s 
experienced it. Go ahead and give it to him. Put yourself in the situation 
where you’re working with kids because that was the context that we were 
mostly in. How would you feel now about just telling them what to do in a 
situation where they need to really learn something to be inspired as a human 
being rather than just because it’s a silly little thing? 
 
Devin: 
I feel like a big brother. 
 
Igor: 
A big brother in what way? 
 
Devin: 
In the way I’m supposed to be. If I’m forced to eat pizza every day of my life, 
I’m going to hate pizza. Sometimes you want spaghetti or sometimes you 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
338 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
want sushi. So, I mean you have to have some kind of variations, definitely 
variations. 
 
Igor: 
Can you hear what’s going on here? He’s now rationalizing for us all the 
reasons why the new behavior is correct. Now the way to test it is how would 
you feel if you only ever treated the kids in your old style? If that’s the only 
thing you ever did, how would you feel about yourself? 
 
Devin: 
I’d feel addicted or like Stalin or something. 
 
Igor: 
That’s how you know because now he has motivation, an emotional drive that 
will block him from being that way constantly. There will be times when it’s 
appropriate. That’s called choice. Does that answer your question better?  
 
 
It’s internally driven. It’s not externally imposed. He’s not trying to live up to 
my standard. He’s living up to his standard. If I now try to interfere and tell 
him no it’s all right, kids need structure, they need to be told what to do – you 
can already see it happening right now. He’s already thinking, you dick. 
 
Student: I don’t want to say it. 
 
Igor: 
You don’t want to say it, but you are. 
 
Student: Telepathically. 
 
Igor: 
You see this is different. This is an internally driven mechanism. He owns it 
now and that’s why of the three styles of questions, I use psychologically 
leading questions only for trivial stuff that will let me bypass relatively minor 
stuff.  
 
 
I’ll use the logically leading questions to open things up, but for the stuff that 
really matters, I’ll focus on the intuitively leading questions because that’s 
where it’s internalized totally. Between two and three, that’s where the real 
magic happens.  
 
Student: At a deep level, I think I understand that. I think what I’m missing here is – I 
had a tremendously amazing experience with a client and it was intuitively 
leading her to come to that conclusion, had an amazing shift in her life, three 
weeks later she had an event and it went back to an old state, which changed 
the way she was thinking.

Igor: 
I understand. Let’s put it this way. Number one, we have not eradicated the 
old choice. I can make a prediction right now. I haven’t really technically 
finished with Devin, but the prediction I’ll make is this.  
 
 
If Devin gets frustrated with the kids because they’re just being annoying little 
things that rhyme with its, he will revert to the old style of just telling them 
what to do because that has the strongest connections in his pathways. It’s 
been a default for so long.  
 
 
Think of it this way. Imagine a mountain with a river and a stream. The river 
has had more rainwater going down it, so when it really pours the stream will 
overflow and it will go back into the river. I need to either make that stream 
as big as the river was so he has genuine choice – which is why I said we 
haven’t totally finished in terms of the therapeutic things – or I have to build a 
dam, which means that if it starts raining there is a safety valve.  
 
 
What you’re describing really in terms of this situation is that something 
happened for which she had no coping mechanism. The only coping 
mechanism was the old style, so she went back to the old style.  
 
 
It’s really what Joe was saying about the smoking. If you fix that and say oh, 
no big deal, let’s give you a coping mechanism for that sort of thing too and 
then we’ll go back to choice again. 
 
 
Think of it this way. Let’s say there are 100 situations in which the problem 
was occurring. You do an intuitive leap like this and 99 of them are done. 
Every time it happens, no big deal. Every time it happens, no big deal.  
 
 
She never thought about that one situation because it rarely happens, but it 
happens one day. You just didn’t catch it. There’s a set of conclusions that 
happen. This thing happens and she has no coping mechanism.  
 
 
Her mind defaults to what it knows best and she does this destructive 
behavior, and what can she conclude from that? What can she infer? It didn’t 
work. It’s an inference and the inference allowed to continue will actually 
create the old behavior again for the other 99 situations. It’s not that she 
can’t do it. It’s merely that she made an incorrect assumption.

Student: So what I’m understanding from this is there’s virally, no way that you can 
guarantee 100%... 
 
Igor: 
There’s no guarantee for anything. 
 
Student: Right. So, you can do as much as you can… 
 
Igor: 
Actually, I take that back. I’ll make you one guarantee. The one guarantee I’m 
making is if you try to find anything that’s 100% in life, apart from this 
guarantee, you’ll be sorely disappointed.  
 
Student: You’re right.  
 
Igor: 
You can get very close but it’s no big deal. Just come back in, we’ll fix that, 
done. 
 
Student: It’s just frustrating. I get it. Thanks. 
 
End Of Day Benediction 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. We’ve been working hard today. I think a useful thing that 
happens at the end of a day like this is for people who have pens and papers 
they usually put them on the floor. Can you draw an inference from that? Is 
there an implication?  
 
 
If you have discovered an adequate implication from that, then you’ll 
probably be closing your eyes right about now. Whether you have closed your 
eyes or not, either way you may find that your attention starts focusing inside 
a bit more.  
 
 
Now when your attention focuses inside, there are many places of comfort 
that your mind can turn its attention to, and even a small comfort can grow in 
time. The interesting thing is your conscious attention can be on one thing 
whilst your unconscious is on another.  
 
 
So, for example, you can consciously appreciate whatever level of comfort is 
increasing. You can recollect a lifetime of experiences of relaxing your body 
and relaxing your mind and drawing deep comfort from that, whilst 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
341 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
unconsciously you could have a lifetime of experiences of learning something 
and actually learning more than you realize. 
 
 
We’ve all had the experience of wrestling with a problem and not making any 
headway, or so we thought. Then one night you sleep, you dream, you wake 
up the next day and you might have an insight, or maybe it takes for you to 
get up and take a shower and suddenly there it is. 
 
 
Maybe it was just a casual word that someone said to you, and instantly your 
mind just clicked on a whole different level, on a whole bunch of other things 
that you’ve been wrestling with and now can put to rest. 
 
 
You had many experiences here. Some you’ve wrestled with and some you’ve 
instantly appreciated. Some you learned from and knew you were learning 
consciously.  
 
 
Others, you were convinced consciously that no learning was occurring and all 
the time underneath it all had no idea of just how much you really were 
getting.  
 
 
Right now you can just sit there and relax comfortably, and hasn’t that 
comfort growth? You have no idea how you did that but there it is. Your 
breathing has altered. Your temperature has altered. Your pulse has altered. 
Your thinking has altered. Your feelings have altered.  
 
 
Chances are there’s more space now inside your mind. Isn’t it strange to think 
of that? More space inside the mind when the mind is something that isn’t 
even located in space.  
 
 
Your brain hasn’t doubled in size. The volume inside your skull hasn’t changed 
and yet you’re probably feeling an increased amount of space in your mind. I 
wonder what that means for you, that comfort and that mental space.  
 
 
You can take a pause and realize that things are occurring outside of your 
conscious awareness that are of great importance. Ideas are integrating. 
You’re beginning to draw inferences and conclusions from your experiences, 
from your understandings and your ideas, and you really do not need to know 
what those are yet.

You get to discover them in your behavior, only it will happen long after those 
things are actually quite natural to you. So, if tonight as you interact with 
people or tomorrow morning when you come back here to do some training 
you discover something interesting, pleasant or new about your behavior, 
especially with Mind Bending Language or your understanding of it, you get to 
have the pleasurable realization that that is just the tip of the iceberg of all 
the wonderful things going on deep inside now. 
 
 
You can really consider that, and I wonder just how comfortable your sleep 
will be tonight safe in the knowledge that your conscious mind will have no 
involvement with it.  
 
 
All I know is that at some point after you have slept and had dreams, you will 
wake up and that’s usually a sign that it’s time for you to get on with your day, 
isn’t it? So, whenever you’re ready, you can wake up to the end of this day 
and begin the important process of making plans about your evening, if you 
haven’t made some already.

DVD 11 – How To Powerfully Elicit A Positive 
Emotional Response 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Good morning everyone. How are you doing? Good. Today’s going to be an 
interesting day and the main reason for that is that we have now done the 
bulk of the preparation work, so we can actually get on with the influencing 
method. 
 
 
You do realize we haven’t done any influencing yet, but we have all the 
building blocks ready for that. Before we launch into that, I’d like to just open 
the floor to you again and see if you have any questions or comments, 
insights, puzzles in terms of what we’ve done so far.  
 
 
If you have any questions or comments, please just lift your hand and stand 
up so we can get the mic to you. That’s a wonderfully curious group. So, you 
know it all. It’s easy. 
 
Student: I was just explaining that long ago I recognized my learning style, which is 
basically to go to lectures, I did that all through Uni, and then build on it. 
When I’m left with reading the text, I struggle with that. So, I’ve got quite a 
number of your courses but I have to say that most of them have not been 
cracked. 
 
 
Coming to this one and being excited about it and learning, I pulled out my 
Advanced Mastery Course. I’m playing it on the CD. I can build on it. It makes 
much more sense to me now. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And also the confidence of being here and actually discovering that I can do 
this, because I was a complete, complete newbie to this but I can actually do 
this.

Igor: 
You can. That’s fantastic. It’s a great insight to have, isn’t it? By the way, the 
feeling you have right now – that sense of being inspired by it all – that’s what 
happens when you get educated rather than indoctrinated because you 
actually base it on experiences now rather than on things you haven’t 
experienced that have to be imagined but have no way of imagining about. 
That’s excellent. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: Hi. For the last couple of weeks I’ve been going in and out of being able to do 
this and going wow I’m channeling Igor, this is fantastic, and then going I don’t 
know what the heck to do. I’m stuck. I go back to my old story where I’ve got 
to be clever and I get in my own way.  
 
 
Then at the end of yesterday, watching you for a couple of days doing 
demonstrations and I thought I’d love to be able to just be in a normal 
conversation and change somebody’s life like you did Devin, like you did 
Joanne.  
 
 
I had this function to go to last night and I thought I’d really rather stay here 
and be with people and in the conversation, so I got to my function and I had 
to sit at a table – 10 lawyers and me. 
 
Igor: 
What fun. 
 
Student: Yes, that’s what I thought. I thought excellent this is going to be a great 
evening. At the end of it the man beside me said wow who would have ever 
thought I would come to a function like this, sit beside someone and have my 
life changed. And it gets better. Then he said I have more things I want to deal 
with and I have a budget for this. 
 
Igor: 
See? Random therapy, gorilla kindness pays off, right? That’s wonderful. 
Thank you so much for that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: Well, I don’t know if I can top that but I did wake up this morning and I was 
looking out the window and the word that came to me was wow I just feel so 
inspired and I don’t know why. I can’t exactly say it but that was just what 
came to me.

Igor: 
May I ask all of you in general, who here feels in similar ways? Once again, 
what is that? Why is your mind feeling inspired? Where are those emotions 
coming from? This is what happens when you open the mind up, when you 
unstick all those frozen thoughts and get back to thinking.  
 
 
You’re designed as a thinking creature, and when you’re doing it properly it is 
pleasurable. It’s a wonderful thing. So, what we think is learning, what we’ve 
been told is the way to learn – which is really just memorizing and it’s really 
not much different from what a parrot does or when you go the university 
and learn those random strings of letters and numbers to test memory. 
 
 
That’s really all you’ve been doing when you think you’ve been “learning.” 
Now you really understand what learning is because you can feel it and what 
it feels like to you right now is the learning process, and that’s how people will 
feel when you influence them.  
 
 
One thing we know about human beings is we have an incredible capacity to 
solve problems. That is one of the only things that we’re good at. We’re not 
the fastest creature. We’re not the strongest creature.  
 
 
We’re not the biggest creature. We can’t even deal with the most intensive 
variations in terms of temperature and so on. We don’t have the greatest 
scope of terrain. But the one thing we can do is we can solve problems better 
than any other creature on this planet. 
 
 
If you get stuck, that’s only because somehow your mind has done something 
ingenious to convince you that you can’t get beyond that. What you’re 
experiencing right now, that’s what happens when the mind opens back up, 
when you get back to that problem-solving ability that’s inside you. Some 
people call it the inner genius and I think I’d agree with them. Thank you for 
sharing that because I think that’s a huge and tremendous insight.  
 
Amir: 
By utilizing this process, we’re adding more choices into people’s lives and as 
a result they’ll pick the best choice available to them. Would you say that 
suggesting not to do a choice as well as providing an alternate choice would 
be a better route in some contexts, or do you think that we should kind of 
stay out of that and let them ultimately make that decision for themselves? 
 
Igor: 
It’s a great question. Do you mind if we address it once we’ve had a chance to 
actually go through the influencing method?

Amir: 
Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Because it will fit right into that. 
 
Amir: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
But it is a very good question, so it’s worth it for you to keep asking yourself 
that.  
 
Student: A few of us were thinking and talking about this and this is in reference to 
Amir. We were wondering if tongue catalepsy is possible.  
 
Igor: 
Actually you’ve missed a trick there. What you’re looking for really is called 
brain catalepsy. 
 
Student: I’d like to thank you for the hypnosis session last night just before we left. I 
have a longstanding problem with being able to sleep, and I’ve tried self-
hypnosis and relaxation and I refuse to use drugs. So, last night I slept so 
soundly and woke up this morning at 5:30 and couldn’t believe it and felt 
rested for the first time in years. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful. Long may it continue, yes! 
 
Student: Can you do the same for us tonight? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Can you do the one that sounds like this?  
 
Student: Just a question. Yesterday when we were doing the question on what 
freedom means to you, while we were doing the exercise – I think it was John 
who was asking me about what freedom means to you and I said something 
about financial freedom and all that.  
 
 
As soon as we finished the exercise, I realized that’s not what freedom means 
to me. I think if I get the skills of The Mentalist TV show that would be 
freedom to me. So, I wasn’t sure what freedom means to me actually and 
where was the real one?

Igor: 
Let me put it this way. Do you think this is trivial enough to be able to answer 
in five minutes, or is it something that’s important enough that you can spend 
the rest of your life thinking about?  
 
Student: You lost me there. 
 
Igor: 
You’re saying you don’t know what freedom is right now, right? 
 
Student: Yes, I wasn’t sure which one is real for me. 
 
Igor: 
Right. It sounds to me like you need to do some thinking, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And you have two choices. You can think about it a little bit and come to a 
minor conclusion, or you can think about it a lot and maybe change your 
whole life with it. Which would you rather do?  
 
Student: Right, well thinking about it a lot. 
 
Igor: 
I’d agree with that. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. Okay, thanks. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. 
 
Student: Can I ask another question? 
 
Igor: 
Sure, but before you do, does that help you out Amir? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Carry on. 
 
Student: So, here when we do the exercises or these techniques or methodology, 
there’s an assumption that we’re already engaged with a particular person in 
order to do the communication. So, are we going to take up techniques on 
how to engage?

Igor: 
Do you mean how to start a conversation with a complete stranger? Is that 
what you’re asking? 
 
Student: Well, not necessarily a complete stranger. Probably one of my specific 
contexts would be my teenage son. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so how do you open the conversation in the first place so you can 
actually have this sort of stuff? Is that right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. That’s what today is about in part. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: Hi, Igor.  
 
Igor: 
Hi. 
 
Student: I just wanted to talk about the problem thing, the solving and the other lady 
was talking about her problem. Just a word problem is a problem for me. I 
think when I was at school and they’d give you all these problems to solve, it’s 
the last thing I really ever wanted to be doing. I think I’ve connected that with 
this word problem, and I wonder if you can offer me any alternate words. 
 
Igor: 
In the industry people like the word challenge, for example. We are challenge-
solvers I guess or challenge-meters in some ways. If you prefer using a 
different vocabulary like that, challenge inspires some people to rise to the 
occasion so to speak. Puzzle is a nice word. Just get a thesaurus and just go 
through it and say I like this one. 
 
Student: Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
Just to carry on from that – because we will be talking about solving problems 
for the rest of today in terms of influencing and so on – would it be okay for 
you to start mentally reframing that for yourself? In other words, when I say 
one word you’ll hear another. It might be more pleasant for you. That’s all. 
 
Student: I think I’m probably a bit stupid, so I’m at a bit of a loss. These last two or 
three days I met with about 10 or 12 people, and I don’t know if it was the 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
349 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Mind Bending Language or if it was them because they opened their hearts so 
much, I felt I knew them forever. I felt that kind of oneness with them, so I 
totally forgot about how are you? What are you and so on? We just indulged 
in a nice conversation.  
 
 
So, I don’t know if that has any implications to Mind Bending Language or if it 
was just the people and how interesting they were and how nice they were. 
 
Igor: 
I agree with you that people you met were probably very nice, and I would 
suspect that most people you’ll meet are equally nice once you get past their 
defenses and barriers. The question I have for you is how did you get them to 
be so nice to you? 
 
Student: I think they are very nice people, and I didn’t think they had anything to hold 
back. So, the minute our eyes met and we started talking to each other – and I 
myself blabber quite a lot about things… 
 
Igor: 
May I give you a brief demonstration? Just watch this for a second. This is 
going to require a little bit of moral courage for this, so I apologize and 
hopefully you can bear with me on this. If you’ve ever been unpleasant to 
someone else, please put your hand up. Look around the room. It includes the 
10 or 12 people that you’ve been talking about how nice they were.  
 
 
So, if we can conclude from that – and please correct me if I’m wrong on this 
– we should be able to conclude that those people were at least as capable of 
being deeply unpleasant to you as they were nice. So, how come they chose 
one over the other? 
 
Student: I don’t know. 
 
Igor: 
That’s right. That’s something worth considering and as you’re considering 
that, consider just the mere possibility that you learned a little bit more about 
this stuff than you realized and it just came out naturally. 
 
Student: I think so. 
 
Igor: 
Which means that you’re probably a lot smarter than you realized. 
 
Student: You should ask my wife about that.

Igor: 
You may well be married to your wife but you’re also married to your 
unconscious, and I know the answer to that one already. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: It just took me back to the exercises yesterday – one of them – and what 
happens when you get a hot button issue and there’s a question that you put 
out and some of them are so polarized and you’re having a hard time keeping 
your neutrality. 
 
Igor: 
So, is it a hot button issue for you or for the person you’re trying to influence? 
 
Student: It could be for either of them or it could be for both. 
 
Igor: 
There are two slightly different situations. If it’s your hot button, then you 
need to develop enough emotional control or mental discipline to keep 
yourself out of your stuff. Otherwise the influence process becomes very 
difficult.  
 
 
It’s true. We’re human beings. If I get all riled up, then I revert to the most 
ineffective ways possible – louder, faster and repeating myself – which of 
course works really well, doesn’t it? 
 
 
If it’s the other person’s hot issue, then that’s perfect. That’s exactly what you 
want. You just hit pay dirt. You just have to be more delicate in tip-toeing 
around it.  
 
 
Remember the 10 keys, which we’ve developed nine of so far, I think. Let’s 
have a look. There’s another one! Where did that come from? Has he been 
cheating? So, there are 10 keys, which we’ll address don’t worry. Just when 
you thought you had it, right? 
 
 
But really that’s one that really is important – taking those baby steps, really 
taking care of their emotional wellbeing and validating them because all 
they’re saying when it’s a hot button is that this is the point at which they’re 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
351 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
very fragile. So, if you can respect that, your chance to influence them will 
increase significantly.  
 
Student: I’ve been very excited about what I’ve been learning. It feels like I’ve 
experienced a lot. At the same time, I also feel myself to be in this huge fog. In 
summary it’s like what the hell have I learned and where the hell am I going? 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate that. Is anyone else on that sort of boat? You’re really happy 
where you are. You just don’t know where that is or where that’s going. 
 
Student: I’m not sure at all if I’d be able to apply what I’ve learned. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. I appreciate that because let’s face it we haven’t completed the picture 
yet. If I may reiterate where we started this morning, we’ve spent the last 
three days building building-blocks. We’ve just set the foundation for 
something. You have no idea what the house looks like yet unless you can 
read my mind, and if you can, then here’s a fore-taste of what’s going to come 
today. For the rest of you, you’ll just have to wait and find out.  
 
 
The clarity will come when I’ve put the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together 
with you over the course of today and a little bit of tomorrow as well. So, 
don’t concern yourself about that.  
 
 
Like with most of my courses, you’ll spend at least the first half if not the first 
three-quarters of the course building the necessary skills to actually make 
sense of the thing I actually want to teach you, which is what we’ll be moving 
into today and tomorrow. So, the practical application elements are just 
coming now. Everything else you think you’ve learned was just a bonus. 
 
Amir: 
This is probably another question worth considering. Do you think that 
thinking is correlated with their state? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Amir: 
Because I found that based on my experiences, if it was either really positive 
or really negative I still did a lot of thinking. So, when is it useful for which? 
 
Igor: 
I think thinking is always useful. Thinking is a tool, so let me ask you this. Is a 
hammer useful? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
352 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is it useful when you’re hitting someone over the head with it? 
 
Amir: 
No, unless that’s your intention. 
 
Igor: 
A little bit of rough neurosurgery, like oh look this is a brain, I knew it looked 
like that. You get the idea, right? 
 
Amir: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, a hammer is just a tool. It can be used to build a house. It can be used to 
destroy a house. Thinking is a tool. Let’s go back to yesterday. Every question 
you will ever ask will be leading in some way. It will be psychologically leading, 
logically leading or intuitively leading. It has to lead one way or another.  
 
 
Questions are not neutral. It’s virtually impossible. Even if I say to you what is 
hypnosis, I’ve just been leading you because I’ve excluded every other topic. If 
I say what do you think about hypnosis? I’m leading you double because not 
only am I limiting your choices about what to think about, but I’m actually 
forcing some thinking too. 
 
 
So, all questions are biased by their nature. They may be marginally biased or 
more majorly biased. The only different in the thinking that you do when 
you’re upset or depressed versus when you’re happy and elated, is that the 
nature of the questions you ask yourself changes. 
 
 
When you’re depressed you ask yourself, why is my life so bad? And that’s 
something that thinking about that particular question and the implications of 
that question may well not serve you.  
 
 
On the other hand when you’re elated, you think to yourself this is amazing. 
How can I have more of this? That’s a good question to ask. Now if you can 
develop discipline, you can learn to ask yourself a question when you’re 
feeling bad like how can I get myself out of this, or how can I get through this? 
What do I need to do now? When you have a thought – for example you’re 
mean, you’re unpleasant, you’re useless etc., you know the kind of things we 
say to ourselves to cheer ourselves up when we’re depressed – you can also 
challenge those thoughts in the same way you’ve been challenging them here.

You’re useless. Really? What makes you think that? Where did that idea come 
from? What is that based on? Is that really true? The same kind of things 
we’ve been doing will fit in that context also. Now, of course, the purpose of 
this seminar has not been to teach you the self-application of thinking skills in 
that sense. This has been more of the learning in terms of how to apply a skill 
set.  
 
 
That is a separate skill set that we could very fruitfully invest time into. It kind 
of goes into the idea of an advanced self-hypnosis program if you like, but you 
get the essence of what I’m talking about. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Student: Part of my reason for coming is my sister – who’s fabulous and does 
hypnotherapy – she suggested I come. I haven’t done any of this. For me, I’ve 
worked in activism and you’re often dealing with people where it’s a hot 
button issue for both parties and I’ve never navigated it particularly well or 
with any degree of tact. 
 
 
So, it was always I would go right into the indoctrination and right into the no 
you’re wrong, and I’d do it fast and I’d get all flushed and red and it would get 
off fast, so for me yesterday I had two political conversations with people with 
whom there was a degree of commonality, but then fairly sharp divergences.  
 
 
With both of them I managed not to do no you’re wrong. I didn’t interrupt. I 
was able to find commonality. I couldn’t quite get to the questions yet, but I 
was going oh you didn’t do that, but to be able to do that and to be able to 
observe my partner when we were having a discussion over lunch eat faster 
and say okay I understand what that means, it was just so fabulous and so 
powerful. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations. I think that’s a great learning there. 
 
Student: Just a quick clarification just so I get the differences in my mind. Could you 
give a quick demonstration or example of what the difference of those three 
different types of leading questions is? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. It’s a little difficult without a context. 
 
Student: Just pick a context. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
354 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
I’m trying to construct one out of thin air. Usually I’m reacting with this, so I’m 
trying to create one right now to get a clear distinction. 
 
Student: Okay, thank you. 
 
Igor: 
A psychologically leading question might be something like okay let’s talk 
today about animal conservation. Do you think animals need protecting? 
That’s psychologically leading. I’ve opened the topic of animal conservation.  
 
 
There’s already an implication there that they need protection of some sort, 
so I’m implying the answer I want to her. Yes sir, it’s true. If I wanted a 
genuine opinion, I’d have to frame it different to give both options, like some 
people think animals need protection, especially from mankind. 
 
 
Others think that animals can take care of themselves and they’ve been doing 
so for millions of years and there’s really no need for us to interfere with that. 
What do you think? That is less leading now. Did you hear the difference? 
 
Student: Absolutely, yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, that example is a psychologically leading question. A logically leading 
question would be what is the difference between a word and a letter? 
 
Student: A letter is just a representation of the sound, and a word is something that 
actually has meaning for us. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so words don’t have sounds with them? 
 
Student: A word would be an organization of letters, so it’s a higher order. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Thank you. That’s logically leading but I’ll take it another step just to 
make it plainer. What’s the difference between a number and a numeral? Do 
you see where his mind is going?  
 
 
I’m using a difficult topic because I know in North America mathematicians 
are great at creating math phobics. Hence, it requires more thinking. Now I’m 
going to switch back to psychologically leading just for the sake of brevity. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
355 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Do you think that a numeral is to a number what a letter is to a word? Would 
that be a reasonable thing to consider? 
 
Student: Okay, yes. Now I get it. 
 
Igor: 
Did you see what happened? Did you see the realization dawning? That’s not 
as powerful as him doing it on his own. If I just let him wallow in that a little 
bit longer and added more questions to get him to that conclusion himself, 
that would be a stronger learning.  
 
 
This was a milder learning because it’s psychologically leading, but at least 
you get the difference between the two now, correct? 
 
Student: Yes, I do. 
 
Igor: 
Intuitive leading is a little more difficult to demonstrate because you really 
have to capture the moment with this. The best way I can describe it is if you 
remember when Joanne was up here having a strong emotional experience, 
and all I was saying at that point was something like that’s clearly a strong 
thing. Yes. So, what does that have to teach you about what you want to 
achieve about Mind Bending Language? Then she connected the dots. 
 
Student: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
There was no logic in that. It was a leap of logic but I knew the direction it was 
going in already. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, it does. Thank you very much for that clarification. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. 
 
Student: I’m staying with a friend downtown in Toronto and we’ve known each other 
since we were teenagers, but we haven’t seen each other for a while and he’s 
been going through some health issues. So, to have a houseguest may not be 
the best thing for him and he’s been very grouchy, very defensive. It’s been 
uncomfortable. 
 
 
Friday was very uncomfortable and I really wondered how I was going to get 
through the next few days. So, yesterday was a very exciting day and I was 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
356 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
buoyed up by what I learned and I just thought whatever happens tonight is 
what’s going to happen.  
 
 
Well, physically he was hunched over. He was green in the face when I 
arrived. I just carried I guess the excitement of what I had learned yesterday 
to his house. His whole physiology changed. His face became pink. He was 
smiling. His hair even looked different. His body posture was completely 
different. He was upright and open. I was just thrilled.  
 
Igor: 
Good job. 
 
Student: So, thank you very much. 
 
Igor: 
It’s all on you on this one. Seriously. Give her a round of applause for that. 
Now hopefully you get more of a better understanding of the power of these 
10 keys. I know we haven’t dealt with number 10 yet, but it will come. 
 
Student: Just a self-observation, I was wondering if this is a function of what we’ve 
been doing here. I’ve been attending seminars for quite a while, for some 
years, and one thing which was common as a self-observation was that I 
wasn’t really sure what I was learning apart from a couple of things which 
happened in my life. 
 
 
I wasn’t sure what I picked up from the seminars and they worked. I would 
say they were very good seminars. They were great seminars. I think I’m 
getting into this same frame of mind here where I’m saying I’ve been here for 
two days now. I’m enjoying this but I’m not really sure what I’m learning and 
maybe at the end of the five days I’ll be in the same state. 
 
Igor: 
Maybe. 
 
Student: However, what I noticed is that this is the very first time, or this is the seminar 
where I’ve talked the most in public. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. 
 
Student: So, I don’t know if it’s something to do with what’s happening here, but that’s 
a change.

Igor: 
Just remember the golden rule of hypnosis – if anything positive happens 
within a five-mile radius of you, you’re responsible. So, you’re welcome. 
 
Student: Thanks. 
 
Student: Just a very simple question. When I look at the keys, this question comes to 
my mind. Ten keys to – how do you? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: How do you complete the rest, keys to what? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: Keys to yes? 
 
Igor: 
That was a clever attempt. I guess you’ll just have to think about that for a 
while. You see, sometime the mind looks for certainty. Let’s put it this way. 
When you’re certain about something, do you bother looking for a better 
answer? So, I hope you’re certain enough about this to use it and unsure 
enough about it to keep looking. Are there any other questions? 
 
Student: I noticed when I was working with one gentleman that it was really difficult 
for me to get specifics out of him, and I was wondering if one goal maybe is to 
have people that think abstractly to get more concrete answers out of them 
and vice versa. 
 
Igor: 
That can be very mind bending for them. That’s actually a classic mind 
bending maneuver, absolutely. You guys are full of questions for people who 
seemed very reticent to start with. 
 
Student: I want to backtrack to the gentleman who was talking about his states and 
how nice the people were to him. My question is around that because it also 
lands on top of this lady’s question about just feeling good about states in 
general. 
 
 
My experience is that hey you can get addicted to this feeling good stuff, and 
that happens it’s like there’s no creativity here I’ll just go from state to state 
to state to state.

My real question to you is about the brain. At some levels, I think I’m looking 
for some correlation between brainwave activity and what we’re doing here 
because I had this thought recently at theta level – or whatever level, I’m not 
sure – but we are happy to kill each other. At another level, we’re happy to 
pray for each other. We’re busy praying for each other. Do you know what I 
mean? I’m just curious about that. 
 
Igor: 
The thing you’re describing doesn’t actually fit the brainwave model. Just to 
give you a little bit of indoctrination about the idea of brainwaves, the way it’s 
currently understood is of course your brain has electrical activity. That’s how 
it works. 
 
 
Those patterns of activity create a cycle of waves. You can measure these 
things. There are different cycles. From 15 to 20 it’s called beta; 11 to 15 
roughly is called SMR, which is part of beta and part of alpha kind of thing; 7 
to 10 or something like that will be alpha; and below that is theta, delta and 
so on. 
 
 
Now the correlation between brainwaves and any kind of experience isn’t at 
the level of oh this level is aggression and this level is this and so on. Think of 
it more like gears in a car.  
 
 
A car can take you to work in first gear and it can take you to work in third 
gear. A car has difficulty starting in third gear and a car has difficulty going fast 
in first gear. So, whether you’re driving to work or running over your granny, 
the gear is irrelevant. That’s a choice made by the driver, not by the car. 
 
 
All the gear does is it makes one particular type of activity more efficient over 
another. That’s kind of how we currently understand brainwaves to work. 
There’s a tendency in the self-improvement field to say alpha, yay, we should 
all get alpha and bliss out and be geniuses and creative and so on. 
 
 
There’s some truth to that. The problem is that without the beta brainwaves, 
you can’t focus, you can’t concentrate, you can’t complete simple common 
tasks. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests – and this is not conclusive 
– that those kids who are labeled ADD or ADHD, or at least those that haven’t 
just been conveniently labeled that because teachers are boring and think it 
can’t be me, so it must be then.

The other kids – the ones who may have something going on – tend to have 
problems keeping out of theta. Theta is basically the brainwaves you go into 
when you’re in deep sleep. The theory goes that these kids are constantly 
falling asleep and they’re acting out to engage their reticular activating system 
to stay awake, so they’re going to miss their entire life. 
 
 
By training them to go into what’s called the SMR frequency, or low-level 
beta, they learn to focus again, to concentrate and all these things that come 
with that. I don’t want to get into the whole brainwaves model at this point 
because it’s far beyond the scope of what we’re doing here. It’s just to advise 
you to look into it a little bit more carefully, and particularly look at the 
scientific studies that have been done as opposed to what people peddling 
alpha or theta states and so on are telling you because it’s a more involved 
picture than that. 
 
 
Does that make sense? Does that help? You’re right. The real answer to your 
question in terms of what makes one person be nice to people and then turn 
around and be nasty to someone else, that’s a very complex question and 
really the only way I know of finding out is to probe their minds.  
 
 
This is something we’ll come onto later today – how to use this as a functional 
tool – because we haven’t got into the influencing yet. All of you who have 
been influencing people in a positive way over the last few days, either in 
here or out there, well shame on you. You’re ahead of the class. Does that 
help? 
 
Student: I feel like I’m in this kind of curious paradoxical state of thinking and non-
thinking, and I have to think to create probing questions but when I think too 
much, I think I create brain catalepsy. So, what I’ve been trying to do and it 
seems like magic when I can empty my mind and go into non-thinking, and 
then something else kind of magical and poignant happens. I’d love to be able 
to do it on command. 
 
Igor: 
Of course. The first question I have for you is how did you do it when you did 
it well? 
 
Student: I didn’t think about it. It just seemed to happen. 
 
Igor: 
That’s right. What you’re describing – if I can maybe put some words to this 
that are a little different, and please correct me if it misses your experience –

is that you have different ways of thinking, and maybe we can call one style 
conscious thinking and the other style unconscious thinking.  
 
 
 
Both have their place and both have a value. As a rule of thumb, unconscious 
thinking is required for any performance-rated activity because it requires so 
many complex things and you can’t be aware of all of them at the same time 
consciously. You have limited capacities. Conscious thinking on the other hand 
is very, very useful to probe and correct ideas and just to have that 
intellectual curiosity and so on. So, they both have a great value. 
 
 
My personal opinion, my belief, my inference from the experiences I’ve had 
doing a lot of teaching is that the order of usefulness is the non-conscious 
thinking is the primary mode, the one that gets you most behaviors, gets most 
of the experiences, allows stuff to happen and then to use that later. The 
conscious form of thinking is phenomenal and I mean phenomenal at 
improving things that you already have. If you haven’t got them, it’s very 
difficult to polish something you don’t have.  
 
 
Think of it this way. Imagine someone planting a seed in the ground and then 
every morning getting up, digging the seed up, turning the shoots and giving 
them a little hand and saying come on, up you get, up you get, and then 
putting it back in the ground, covering it over and saying yeah that’s going to 
be a killer plant there. 
 
 
You’re helping the process along before anything’s happened. You’ve got to 
wait until the plant has grown out of the ground, and then you can start doing 
things.  
 
 
Then you can put a little stick in the ground to help it wind around it. You can 
move the plant around in the house, so more sunlight comes towards it and 
so on, but there’s no point in doing any of that stuff until the plant has taken 
root on its own.  
 
 
That to me is the difference between conscious and non-conscious thinking. 
Both have great value. You will never hear me saying that conscious thinking 
is a bad thing. It’s only a problem when it interferes with something that you 
want to achieve – for example in this case.  
 
 
Knowing that, you’ll know there are times when you could practice – in other 
words polish – and then thinking is very appropriate in the conscious style.

There are other times when you just need to be good at it – in other words 
you want to get a result – in which case thinking less will serve you more in 
the traditional sense. Does that help? 
 
Student: That helps very much because I found the moments that have been most 
poignant for me are the ones that ended up to be the simplest too.  
 
Igor: 
It seems simple but they may well have been complex or sophisticated in 
terms of your behavior. The reason it seems simple is because your conscious 
mind had no idea what was going on. It’s like oh yeah I should do this. 
Meanwhile the unconscious mind is doing the 101 tasks that are required to 
do that properly, right? 
 
Student: Yes, I can almost feel like something’s happening in the background. 
 
Igor: 
Would you all like an example of this sophisticated activity? It’s really easy but 
actually it’s devilishly hard. Would you like an example of this? Would all of 
you please just stand up for a moment? 
 
 
Now whatever you do, don’t fall over, okay? Here’s the crazy part. Do you 
have any idea how insanely difficult it is to keep your balance on these tiny 
little things when you are such a long object, which has its center of balance 
in a very awkward place? This is a very difficult task. If you ask people who 
manufacture robots or artists or something like that to allow something like 
this to occur is not impossible. Have a seat again. 
 
 
If you doubt me, then during a break go get yourself a regular pencil and 
stand it on its end. That’s essentially what you’ve been doing. Why on Earth 
did you not fall over? You think it’s simple to stand up, don’t you? You think 
it’s simple to just stand there and not fall. It’s like of course I can stand here. 
That’s not a big deal. You have no idea the amount of muscular contractions 
that you’re constantly engaging in to keep your balance. 
 
 
The fact is when you’re standing up, you’re not on balance. You’re constantly 
losing your balance and then making shifts in your muscle tone to 
compensate. That’s actually what’s going on but you don’t know this, do you? 
It seems simple to you.

Mind Bending Language is very difficult when you look at it consciously. It is 
the simplest thing in the world once you’ve done all this stuff and internalized 
it. I don’t even think about these assessing thought things anymore.  
 
 
 
Assessing Thoughts/Thinking: 
1. Clear & Concise 
2. Relevant, Important/Significant 
3. Precise & Accurate 
4. Fact, Opinion & Judgment 
5. Emotional Response 
6. Logic & Reason 
7. Type of Thinking/Thought 
 
 
Would you like to know what goes on inside my mind? It’s very simple. 
 
1. What am I curious about? They just said something. Does that make 
me curious about something?  
 
2. How are they reacting? 
 
 
Done. That’s about all my mind can cope with. I’m serious. The reason it took 
so long for us to get to this point here is because it took me literally years to 
figure out what the hell I’m doing, and this may not even be the full picture 
yet but it’s close enough that we can all get closer to this ideal point we’re 
trying to get to. 
 
 
Does that make sense to you? Does that help? That’s getting to into deep 
areas, isn’t it? Who thought you would come to a seminar and do some deep 
thinking? Are there any other questions or comments? 
 
Skills Review 
 
Igor: 
I think it’s time to do an exercise. I see that most of you have arrived now, 
which is excellent. You’re familiar with the six styles or types of probing 
questions, and of course there’s a huge variety of ways that you can probe in 
these directions, correct?

Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
5. Inferences & Conclusions 
6. Implications & Consequences 
 
 
 
Whilst you’re doing that, you have seven rough guidelines in terms of 
assessing what kind of responses you’re getting. The seventh one, by the way, 
we didn’t write up before but you’ve been doing it anyways, which is what 
kind of thinking or thoughts is this person having? 
 
 
 
Assessing Thoughts/Thinking: 
1. Clear & Concise 
2. Relevant, Important/Significant 
3. Precise & Accurate 
4. Fact, Opinion & Judgment 
5. Emotional Response 
6. Logic & Reason 
7. Type of Thinking/Thought 
 
 
Is it a glib thought? Is it a prefabricated thought? Are they being defensive 
and refusing to think? Are they actually thinking through at one level? 
Remember that layer cake you went through yesterday? You can already see 
kind of what level or type of thinking is going on inside someone.  
 
 
Would that be fair to say? This is yes. This is no. This is called brain catalepsy, 
which is its own style of thinking. That’s another little thing but that’s 
something you’ve been doing already.  
 
 
Of course we have our 10 keys to something.  
 
 
 
Keys: 
1. Questions – Curious 
2. Non-Judgmental 
3. Validation 
4. Columbo Approach 
5. Pauses 
6. Baby Steps

7. EQ Reframe/Glattery & Appreciation 
8. Summarize/Echo 
9. I Wonder….. 
10. Goading 
 
 
What that may be is a thing for you to determine. The only thing I want you to 
add now is to have a little chat about number 10. I’ve called it various things 
over the years. I currently call it goading because it sounds like goats and 
that’s a funny word to me. 
 
 
The idea for this originally came to me from a man called Frank Farrelly. Is 
anyone familiar with his work? It’s called Provocative Therapy. Frank Farrelly 
was an American Irishman, and that’s an important part of the story. You 
know, the Irish twinkle in his eye and the Irish sense of mischief.  
 
 
He was also a therapist and by his own account he was an emotionally 
ineffective therapist for the early part of his career, but he meant well. He 
was definitely trying to help people. 
 
 
One day he decided you know what, what I’m doing right now is totally 
useless. So, I’m going to do what I feel like doing instead of what I should be 
doing because, let’s face it, doing the wrong thing has a better chance of 
working than the things I’m being told to do because they’re definitely not 
working. 
 
 
It takes a bit of moral courage or intellectual courage to try that doesn’t it? I’ll 
paraphrase. I’m not entirely sure if this is exactly the first version of it, but 
you’ll get the picture of what I mean here.  
 
 
In comes a client and he sits down and says life sucks, I think I’ll kill myself. 
Frank Farrelly – and this is important – with his twinkle in his eye, which is 
kind of like number seven, with his emotional tone in the right place, he says 
okay go ahead. How would you like to do it?  
 
 
My window’s not very high up. We’d have to go to the top of the building. I 
think you’d get a good nice splat from there. You could get a gun but you’d 
have to deal with some real dodgy people, but then hey you could get lucky. 
They might shoot you before they sell you a gun.

He goes on and on and on about this, and the patient is sitting there in horror 
looking at him going what are you doing? You’re not supposed to say this. 
Aren’t you supposed to talk me out of it?  
 
 
He says yes, technically my job description tells me I should be talking you out 
of it but, let’s face it your mind’s made up. What the hell can I do? Go ahead, 
kill yourself. The patient gets indignant and says what kind of doctor do you 
call yourself? I don’t really want to kill myself. I’m just depressed! 
 
 
Did you notice what just happened? Did he get a better quality of 
information? This is what I call goading. You’re needling people. You are 
purposefully misinterpreting what they’re saying and exaggerating it to a 
ridiculous degree so that they get so upset with you that they tell you the 
truth – or actually tell you the truth they didn’t know they had. 
 
 
Now you’ve experienced it in here over the last few days. A few of you have 
already said this. You experienced it and you thought it was a mistake, not 
realizing that you just discovered the essence of an ingenious device.  
 
 
When someone says something to you and you try to summarize it and put 
your own words into it – in other words you push too hard – if someone says I 
want to fly on vacation but I can’t, you say that’s right. You want to fly on 
vacation but you can’t because your mother has leprosy and you’re afraid her 
feet will fall off when you take her on the plane. Is that right? 
 
 
That’s just a weird example. I don’t know why. What do they do? They get a 
little bit indignatious with you, don’t they? They get indignant and say no, 
that’s not what I mean. I’m afraid of planes. 
 
 
Oh, I know. I get it. I’m sorry. You got attacked by a plane when you were 
young, didn’t you? It was a run-by planing or something. They say ha-ha funny 
man. No, I’m afraid of getting in the plane and flying. I have a fear of crashing.  
 
 
So, they’re giving you the information that you need because you’re prodding 
them and you’re pushing them back, and when they’re in the pushback they 
don’t realize how much further they’re coming. It’s a very useful little 
technique.  
 
 
Don’t get carried away with it. I wouldn’t necessarily use it for everything 
because if you decide to use it for everything, then you will be writing the

next bestseller called How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. So, do you 
understand the idea of goading? 
 
Student: Is this the same idea that you presented in terms of objective. You said the 
story of the CEO and it’s where bypassing hostility and sales rejections. If 
somebody is presenting hostilely, you’re bypassing that by kind of pushing 
them too far. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, if I understand you correctly, you’re asking is that the kind of thing that I 
did with the CEO who was being hostile with us and we just left, and he starts 
running after us. That’s called a hypnotic reversal, so it’s related to it. I guess 
it will have a similar effect because you’re exaggerating it. 
 
 
The main difference is we’re not leaving. We’re not turning around in that 
way. Let me put it this way. If it’s useful for you to think in that way, then yes, 
although I think of it differently. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. 
 
Student: Would it be fair to say this is a verbal way, and what you just said about the 
whole walking out on the CEO is a physical way? 
 
Igor: 
Again, if it helps you to think of it that way, then yes, and I think of it 
differently. 
 
Student: Your story about the suicide reminds me of a Milton Erickson story where a 
woman came in and she did the same thing. She said oh Dr. Erickson, I think I 
want to kill myself and he says that’s great! She’s like what? He says how 
much money have you got? Again, she’s wondering. I can’t recall the exact 
context, if she same in rather schleppy. 
 
Igor: 
She did. 
 
Student: Yes, she did and did he comment on it? I can’t remember? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, he basically told her seeing as you’ve got that cash – it was the equivalent 
in today’s terms of maybe $50,000 – he said if you’re going to kill yourself 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
367 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
anyway and you have all this cash, there’s no point in letting the government 
get it, so you may as well spend it on something. 
 
 
He got her into the position where she would go to the department store and 
bought a whole new outfit. He actually had one of his friends take her 
shopping because she had no taste. She had never dressed in a particular 
way, so how would she know what to dress in?  
 
 
He had her dressed by someone. He had her go for a complete makeover and 
get her nails done. He was basically saying you’re going to die anyways, so you 
may as well spend this money in one last frivolous F- you to the world. Then 
slowly but surely she ends up actually appreciating having a life.  
 
Student: Yes, and felt good about herself.  
 
Igor: 
Yes, it’s exactly the same sort of idea, only he did it for the motivation. We’re 
doing it here for the information.  
 
Student: An idea came into my head regarding reframing with the airplane situation. 
We all know that driving a car is a lot safer than being in a plane. So, imagine 
you’re driving down a two-lane highway and all of the sudden there’s a Mack 
Truck coming right at you. What’s going to happen? Is the good tooth fairy 
going to show up and all the sudden that Mack Truck has changed into a fly? 
Reframing? 
 
Igor: 
It can be. Let me put it this way. The only caveat I’ll put around this whole 
thing is especially when it comes to things that may involve personal safety, 
you want to be careful about this.  
 
 
For example, I gave you the suicide quote because it’s dramatic, but there are 
different types of suicidal people – those who just talk about it and those who 
actually do it – and you want to be very careful about which one you do what 
with. 
 
 
So, I’m not giving you any advice about how to do therapy. I’m just illustrating 
the goading principle by exaggerating the situation and misunderstanding 
them. What you’re talking about right now is a reframe, and again you want 
to be careful about the implications of this.

I’ll give you a little story of this if I may because this is how I learned about the 
ecology of misunderstanding a particular idea. Back in the early days when I 
first came across things like hypnosis and NLP, I came across the fast phobic 
and I thought this is great.  
 
 
Does anyone here know the fast phobic cure? Here’s the 60-second version of 
it. You get them to think about whatever scenario they’re afraid of, a little 
image.  
 
 
You see a black and white movie going at fast speed with some clown music 
and at the end of the movie they run it all backwards, and they go backwards 
and forwards until it’s cleared. 
 
 
That’s the bit that I got from it. I had no hint of the mechanics or the 
principles involved in making this thing work. I was such a fool. One day a 
friend of mine comes back to university having gone home for the weekend to 
visit her parents. 
 
 
She’s distraught because while she was at home – let’s say it was Saturday – 
she heard this almighty crash and came running out of the kitchen just in time 
to watch her mother falling down the stairs and just slumped on the ground. 
She basically thought her mother had broken her neck and died. She hadn’t. 
She was fine but for that split second she was devastated, and that shock 
remained with her for days and I made it no better. 
 
 
I thought oh I know how to deal with this. It’s the fast phobic cure, great. 
Here’s what you do. Okay, put yourself in a house and your mother’s at the 
top of the stairs.  You got that? Yes. Now picture her falling down the stairs 
and lying on the ground. Great, now put it backwards and forwards and then 
backwards. By the end of it, she raced out in tears and didn’t talk to me for 
two weeks. 
 
 
It doesn’t mean that the fast phobia cure doesn’t work. It just means that I 
was a complete idiot in misunderstanding the principles behind it. Yes, 
goading works great and use some intelligence or be careful about how you 
use it. 
 
 
Think of it this way. What do you think might go wrong if you presented it 
exactly like that – the idea of the car and the truck coming towards you? The 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
369 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
risk that you run is that they come with a plane phobia and they leave with a 
plane and a car phobia, although your intention is to reverse that around. 
 
 
This is not to say that you can’t do that. Your train of thinking is excellent. Just 
continue that thought process into all the possible variables so that you take 
care of any of the unintended consequences too. Does that make sense? 
 
 
Hence, my preference is to exaggerate to a completely ridiculous degree 
because I’m pretty sure that no one in this history of this planet has ever been 
mugged by a plane. That’s a pretty safe bet. Whereas saying you might crash 
and go into a big fireball – well, that’s probably what they’re afraid of. 
 
 
There’s a nuance there, so think those thoughts through all the way to its 
possible conclusions. If there are no unintended consequences or the 
unintended consequences are very remote then go for it.  
 
 
I’m just giving you a little bit of an ecology check there to make sure that what 
you do is overall helpful rather than harmful. Does that help? It’s not a 
comment on what you’re doing. Just let your thinking expand further than 
that first step and you’ll have a very good check with that. 
 
 
Now the good news is in most conversations, you have a pretty good reality 
check. Even if you get it wrong, you have a great opportunity to switch it 
around very quickly. Just realize you’ve made a mistake, go back and think 
about it and say okay what did I do there? Okay, I’ll do something else.  
 
 
That’s how we learn. As I mentioned before, I have made many more 
mistakes than all of you put together, and some of them were just 
horrendous like that one. Is that helpful? Are there any other comments or 
questions? 
 
Student: Just a minor question. How do you goad a person without denigrating them? 
 
Igor: 
Without injuring them? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s where the Irish twinkle comes in. You do it with a little friendly smile on 
your face, like oh I know what’s going on here. I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you

another emotionally loaded example – this is again from Frank Farrelly with 
fewer risks involved – in other words, not the suicidal one. 
 
 
A man comes in and he says what do you want to talk about? He says I’m 
having problems with my wife. Frank puts this big dirty grin on his face and 
says oh I get it, you can’t get it up, is that right?  
 
 
He says no, the sex life is fine. It’s just that we fight all the time. Oh, I get it. 
She’s interested in other men, isn’t she? That’s what it is, isn’t it? He says no, 
we just need different things.  
 
 
So, he’s getting information out of them by purposely misunderstanding what 
they’re saying. Does that help? But the smile on the face helps. Have you ever 
teased a friend, and they knew you were teasing in some way, right? They’ll 
say oh stop it, no that’s not what I meant, I meant something completely 
different. 
 
 
That’s the kind of emotional energy that I’m talking about when you’re doing 
this. If you have any doubts about it, it’s only one of 10 things that you can 
throw in there, so you don’t need to.  
 
 
It’s there for you as a tool and if you’re not comfortable with the tool yet, 
then do others things first and come back to the tool another time when you 
have more experience doing other things. 
 
Student: As part of the 10 keys, you talked about it a few times today and I added it to 
my list – stepping into the frame of being curious or fascinated by the other 
person, and that can break or make my interaction. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, so let’s make this a little clearer. That’s what drives questions, isn’t it? 
How can you ask a question if you’re not curious about something? I mean 
that’s just how I think of it. That just kind of clarifies it a bit.  
 
 
So, we understand the rough idea of the 10 keys. What I’d like to do now is a 
simple exercise. In a moment you’ll find a partner and you can have any topic 
you wish. You can talk about Mind Bending Language or any other topic. Just 
introduce a topic. 
 
 
Then I’d like you to just completely free-for-all any probing questions that are 
of interest to you, mentally assessing whatever is happening and thinking oh 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
371 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
I’m getting curious about this, that and the other and then just pursuing those 
thoughts and see where that takes you. 
 
 
 
Then of course – I’ll leave these up here – making sure you keep their 
emotional wellbeing in mind throughout. It’s a simple exercise. Your mission 
should you choose to accept it is very simply to probe their thinking as far as it 
will go on that particular topic. 
 
 
Actually let’s make it more interesting. Do you all have an unfulfilled 
aspiration? In other words, something you’d like to achieve in life, something 
you’d like to do in life or experience in life that for whatever reason you have 
not. Does everyone have something like that? Use that as your topic. Just 
probe it as far and wide as it will go. 
 
 
Your purpose is not to do anything with it. It’s purely to probe and see what 
comes out. Make sense? You basically have carte blanche to use anything you 
can think of or not, but I prefer the ones you don’t think of. With that happy 
thought, just put your hand up in the air and find some partners and only put 
it down when you find someone to work with.  
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
How was that? Did you enjoy yourselves? Who wants to have a little chat 
about what you just experience? The first man standing gets a mic. Let’s try 
that again. Who has any experience they want to share, or an idea or an 
insight from that? 
 
Student: Oh, this was just awesome. I mean it was like they were literally just throwing 
diamonds at you.  
 
Igor: 
It’s true. Let me put it this way. Compare where you are right now to where 
you were with the idea of Mind Bending Language before you came to this 
particular course.  
 
 
Doesn’t it all seem so much easier now because you are getting all these 
diamonds? You have so many options of which path to go. You don’t have to 
take one particular path. There are many routes. Do you know the old saying 
all roads lead to Rome? So, you had an experience of that, right?

Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: I want to verbalize this so that it doesn’t escape me. I think I had a eureka 
moment and I’m very excited about that. The biggest thing for me was it all 
started with once upon a time, and now I have a new time and a new 
understanding, and I’m very grateful to my partner and to you for this 
exercise. So, I’m grateful for myself for being here and choosing to express it. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. 
 
Student: And also grateful to all the people here who made my seminar so exciting. 
 
Igor: 
Give him a round of applause. It sounds a bit like a closing speech, but he’s 
right. Without having great people here, I can’t do this. You’re a cut above the 
average mentality for your willingness to actually stick in this room through 
the highs and the lows to get this stuff.  
 
 
So, I agree with you. I genuinely appreciate the fact that you guys are doing 
this stuff. It means I get to do it with you, which is nice. Are there any other 
comments or things you noticed? 
 
Student: I’m sorry, but I would rather take Preparation H for a year than do this again 
and not be able to attempt to solve problems.  
 
Igor: 
I do have some Preparation H. Let me rephrase what I believe I was hearing. 
Either he has a medical condition – which is the more likely – or it is tempting 
and now so evident and easy to actually take the next step of actually going to 
problem-solving that it’s actually hard to keep yourself out of it.  
 
 
Just a couple of notes – and I appreciate the way you said that. First of all, 
what made you think that you weren’t allowed to help resolve the problem 
just because you didn’t need to?  
 
Student: In your introduction of the exercise, you said don’t try to fix it. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
373 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
I said don’t try to fix it and it’s not important whether you do. Whether or not 
you do something about it is fine. It’s more a question of the outcome that I 
was interested in. 
 
Student: And it’s not so much a medical problem as a mental problem. 
 
Igor: 
Well, I guess you’ll have to eat Preparation H in that case. Thank you for that. 
 
Amir: 
The biggest I guess learning or epiphany I got from this experience was even if 
the questions were wrong or bad, it was still useful because it gave you more 
information about the topic.  
 
 
So, if you’re asking the wrong questions, you’re actually asking the right ones; 
and if you’re asking the right ones, you could be asking the wrong ones, which 
is asking the right ones anyway. So, it really doesn’t matter what you’re asking 
because if you use the information, you’ll keep spinning it until you find out 
exactly what you need. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. It’s only a matter of time. 
 
Amir: 
Right. 
 
Igor: 
The only way you can mess this up is if you stop talking and think what did I 
do wrong? Excellent. Thank you for that. That’s a great realization. 
 
Student: Hi. Because you said don’t try to do this, it really freed me up to just go for it 
and things just kind of popped up. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And this was actually really beautiful because I’ve tried a few things like going 
to a little bit of an extreme – like drive on a race track if you don’t like to go 
out in the city – and a few things just popped up, and out of that suggestions 
came very, very naturally. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Good job. That’s exactly how it should be. This should be natural. It 
should feel easy to you. 
 
Student: I think this was the first time that what we’ve been trying to do for the last 
four years – I mean four days; it feels like four years. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Igor: 
Yes, I hear you. 
 
Student: It’s becoming easy for the first time. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. This is the first time that you really have all the fundamental pieces in 
place as well, right? Thank you for that.  
 
Student: I’d like to say that this exercise was very beneficial to me because we’ve been 
focusing on trying to resolve problems, and in this exercise it wasn’t really a 
problem. Both our aspirations were travel related and experiential, but just in 
the conversation we were able to find elements of that that could enhance 
other parts of our lives in ways that we didn’t think were possible.  
 
 
It was kind of a shared experience both ways when we switched turns. It was 
great to see this in a context outside of just problem-solving and more into 
just overall life enhancement. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, and that’s where you actually also get a real sense of cross-
influencing each other. That’s how we learn as people. We’re not silos. We 
don’t exist in a vacuum and this is a great way to learn how quickly that 
collegiate environment can actually help us too. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I think my partner had an upper hand on me because he has some legal 
experience and he was asking very pointed questions, but on my side I found 
it extremely difficult not to sound patronizing but at the same time I felt kind 
of inhibited to be rascally, naughty and ask questions. So, I don’t know if I did 
well or not. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s turn to your partner. Who was your partner? 
 
Student: Paul. 
 
Igor: 
Can you pass him the mic? Did he check with you after the exercise how it 
was for you? 
 
Paul: 
Do you mean how did I feel after the exercise? 
 
Igor: 
Yes.

Paul: 
Not really directly. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so let me be his mouthpiece. How did that go for you? 
 
Paul: 
It felt interesting. It was like basically an exploration. A lot of the stuff I 
already knew but I’d never articulated before. 
 
Igor: 
Did you feel you were being patronized? 
 
Paul: 
No, not at all. 
 
Igor: 
So, once again I assume you have made an assumption. This is an important 
thing, especially at these levels. I know this is the first time you’ve done this. 
This is the first time you’ve been really exposed to this, and this is very 
advanced work by the way. 
 
 
Honestly it took me eight years to even get competent at this, and it’s taken 
me another five years or so to be able to teach it like this. This is a very 
sophisticated subject, and you’ve come into it from nothing to straight to this. 
That’s a big chunk to take. 
 
 
By the way, you’re doing admirably well. One of the things I’m really going to 
encourage you to do for the rest of our time here together – and this is going 
to be serving you very, very well – is to make a point at the end of each 
exercise to check with your partner.  
 
 
You know the old how was that for you? The reason is because it will help you 
to stay out of the frame of mind where you’re making assumptions based on 
actually absence of experience. 
 
Student: I found when I was working with my partner, I had to hold back from applying 
my interpretation on the information that he was presenting. It was so 
tempting to say oh I’ve seen that, I’ve been through that, I know the answer, I 
know the answer and I’ve got to tell him; and instead ask more questions to 
find out what it meant to him.  
 
 
I think that might be the assumptions that you were talking about because I 
felt so inclined to make assumptions to short-circuit and speed up the 
conversation.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
376 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Sometimes you can make those assumptions as long as you’re aware that if 
you do so they may well become a form of goading. So, if you present them as 
goading, if you think you know what’s going on, it’s like oh is it like this or 
not? They’ll go no, it’s like this. Then you go okay, great. Then it’s a smooth 
conversation either way. It’s useful to have those instincts and later on today 
and tomorrow we’ll show you how to develop those instincts for specific 
topics. You’re correct in the general idea, and there are useful ways of using 
that too. 
 
Student: Just an observation. I started this not to fix a problem, obviously just to do it. 
What I found was the solution to his problem was the questions. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: It just came out. I asked the questions and then at about the eight-minute 
mark, he said okay that’s fixed, let’s go to something else. 
 
Igor: 
That’s exactly how it works. I’ve said this many times and people keep saying 
you’re joking with this, aren’t you, because you already know everything 
about hypnosis? That’s not the case. 
 
 
When I start doing anything related to Mind Bending Language, all I know is 
that I have to ask enough questions and eventually the solution will become 
apparent.  
 
 
My aim for you guys – like the 80 percentile range – was to get you to 
understand that experientially. Now that we’ve got that, we’ll start working 
towards practical applications of this as well.  
 
 
Student: In reference to goading, I find that it brings out the naughty part in me. 
 
Igor: 
Good. 
 
Student: Of course when my partner shared that her aspiration is to be a movie 
director, naughty thoughts come in. I said so you want to mix with the rich 
and famous?

She said yes, I want to get to know people with money. I said how do you do 
that? Do you go to bed with them? She said no, no, no. So, should we hold 
back on being naughty a bit? 
 
Igor: 
Well, what a dilemma you presented me with there. When it comes to this 
sort of thing, there’s no hard and fast rule. Really if there’s a heuristic or a rule 
of thumb, it is the more playful and charming you can be with it, the more you 
can get away with things. 
 
 
You can call a little old lady a lady of the night, and she’ll just laugh at you and 
say oh yes very funny if you do it with the right level of charm and playfulness 
and so on because it’s all on the surroundings of it, right? 
 
 
If you mis-time that framing and the emotional part of it too, then the very 
same person who would have thought that the sun shines from very dark 
places of your anatomy will become deeply offended and never wish to speak 
to you again. 
 
 
Hence, it’s difficult for me to give you a rule for that because it really depends 
on your way of expressing yourself, your social mannerisms and so on. Hence, 
it’s a judgment call on how far you push things or not.  
 
 
You will invariably make mistakes and have to apologize for them and do your 
best to fix it, and hopefully you will learn from those mistakes and learn 
where the boundary for you happens to be as you go through life. 
 
 
The artistry is flirting with how close you get to that boundary without 
crossing over it so that you’re always at your edge but not falling off it. Does 
that make sense? I can’t tell you that because that’s a very experiential thing. 
That’s so unique to your personality. 
 
Student: Approach with care. 
 
Igor: 
Approach with care, exactly.  
 
Student: Caution. 
 
Igor: 
Caution, do not feed the elephant.  
 
Student: I just have a quick question. How would you define charm?  

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
378 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Is that really a quick question? Actually, I’ll let my young friend Johnny answer 
that for you because that’s one of the specialties that he specializes in. 
 
Johnny: Charm would be the ability to elicit emotion in others in a way that feels safe 
for them. 
 
Igor: 
Nice. I like it.  
 
Johnny: Safe. Not necessarily comfortable because at some point in time they have to 
feel like whatever emotion you are bringing out in them, they’re safe to feel 
that with you. They’re safe to feel that in the environment that they’re in, and 
you happen to be a main piece of that environment. 
 
Student: Would you say it’s like teasing? 
 
Johnny: For some people it’s teasing. For some people if they were teased throughout 
their childhood, teasing is not safe. That’s what Igor was saying – approach 
with care. 
 
Igor: 
And don’t feed the elephant. Remember that one because elephants never 
forget – and other useless metaphors. 
 
Student: I had an interesting insight during this exercise. It seems the one reason why it 
seemed to work for us is that for that 10-minute segment, one person has the 
stage and it wasn’t going to be taken away from them. Whereas, typically like 
in a social environment upstairs afterwards, it’s almost as if each person is 
always continually vying for center stage and talking about self as a form of 
going for center stage.  
 
 
Here, allowing the other person to be center stage for a longer period of time, 
allowed the opportunity for thinking to occur versus the regular social 
environment could often be mostly regurgitating all thoughts because they 
feel safer than going in a new territory of thinking.  
 
Igor: 
I totally agree, and just to steal Johnny’s thunder on this one, that’s what 
makes you charming because they get to have that center stage. They get to 
let whatever they have come out in a safe way. So, that was an excellent 
realization. Thank you.

Cassie: 
I was just going to say quickly for all the people who are worried about 
making mistakes – on Amir’s point about the right and the wrong questions 
and how really everything is right.  
 
 
 
In my experience when I’ve worked with therapists and hypnotists, etc. the 
best experiences I’ve had actually came from mistakes and from them being 
very caring and having that rapport, and saying I’m sorry and fixing their 
mistake and the safety and the connection got that much higher, and it made 
me feel much more connection than people who never made mistakes with 
me. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, thank you for that. I think those are very wise words worth thinking 
about. That’s what we do here, isn’t it? Are there any other comments or 
questions before we have break? 
 
Student: Thanks. I had a very wonderful time working with Tao. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: She made me think that we just had a conversation. It was really nice and I 
could feel myself thinking, which is a great feeling. I mean it’s like working out 
and having your body feel good, except it’s in your head. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, it’s a mental workout for sure.  
 
Student: The other comment I would like to say is actually to Mr. McKechney. Because 
we are at Igor’s hypnotic extravaganza, there is a new product called 
Preparation H+. 
 
Igor: 
Oooooh! I like that. All right, I think no one can top that particular joke, so 
let’s take a break.

DVD 12 – How To Use “The RIP Formula” To 
Create Perpetual Cycles Of Influence 
 
 
Influencing Cycles - MBL 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back, everyone. How are you doing? Now that we’ve got all the 
foundations in place and now that you’ve had an experience of those 
foundations in action, I’m going to advise you to do two things. 
 
1. The first thing I’m going to advise you to do is maintain all the things 
that were working over the last three days that you’ve been doing, 
especially this morning. Whatever those qualities were, please 
continue to do them.  
 
 
In other words, the casualness, the relaxedness of it, the emotional 
awareness of another human being, the checking in with them and all these 
sorts of things, please continue doing them as we progress because we’re 
about to go into the actual influencing cycles and building off the platform 
that we’ve created together so far. 
 
2. The second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reintroduce the 
Mind Bending Language, the actual mind bending power words, but 
hopefully in a different way now.  
 
 
It reminds me of the saying that used to fascinate me when I was a boy. I used 
to be into the whole martial arts thing and Bruce Lee was, of course, was 
every school boy’s hero.  
 
 
There’s this great interview where he once said before I got into the martial 
arts a kick was just a kick, and a punch was just a punch to me. Then I started 
studying the martial arts and a kick became more than just a kick, and a punch 
became more than just a punch. Now that I’ve mastered the martial arts, a 
kick is just a kick, and a punch is just a punch.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
381 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It’s just a different kick and a different punch to the one you thought it was. 
That was my little addition. It’s my hope that before you even got involved 
with hypnosis a word was just a word, and then you got involved with Mind 
Bending Language and a word became more than just a word. 
 
 
It had lots of nuances and potentials and meanings, and hopefully over the 
course of the last three or four days much of that meaning has expanded for 
you. Would that be an accurate assessment of where you’re at? 
 
 
So, to complete the cycle, we’ve got to get back to the point where a word 
becomes just a word, only a little more. That’s what we’ll be doing now. The 
exercise is going to be very simple. In a minute you’ll get together with a 
partner again – any partner will do – and we’re going to do a series of 
exercises.  
 
 
They’ll be short five-minute pieces each, so 10 minutes in total. We’re going 
to start reintroducing the Mind Bending Language aspects more officially. I 
know that you’ve been doing it kind of by the wayside. I’m just going to 
stretch you to get into that a little bit more. 
 
 
However, I’m going to encourage you not to use a single mind bending word 
unless you can do it totally naturally. Just like that. So, only use the mind 
bending power words or your predicates to the extent that you can do so 
completely naturally and nothing else. Do you understand the restrictions you 
have? 
 
 
Now for the rest, it will be exactly the same as you did earlier on in the last 
exercise. You get to ask any questions you want, any of the six probing styles. 
You get to assess any of the information that comes out in terms of the 
thinking styles and so on. 
 
 
You’ll still be doing your 10 keys. It’s just we’re going to start reintroducing 
the mind bending power words more purposefully. Let’s get some mics out 
here please. Remind me again. What were some of the spatial predicates or 
power words relating to space? 
 
 
 
MBL Power Words/Predicates: 
1. Space – Beyond, Aside, Inside, Over, Under, Anywhere, Through, 
Here, On Top Of, All Over, Next To, In Place Of, Beside 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
382 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Let’s pause it there. It would be fair to say that you are not particularly 
challenged coming up with spatial predicates. Is that fair to say? Whilst you 
have a nice list on the board right now, this is only indicative. You get to make 
up whatever the heck you feel like because you already have. I didn’t put a 
single one of those words on that list. I just typed. I was the magic monkey. 
 
 
Who feels confident they can generate spatial predicates pretty much on the 
fly as the wind takes them? Hands up. Excellent, that’s what I want to see. 
Here’s the exercise. You’re going to get together with a partner. You’re going 
to ask them about a problem or an aspiration. 
 
 
By aspiration I don’t mean the biggest thing in their life that they want to 
achieve. It could be something they just want to get better at. You play the 
piano well. You just want to play better. That’s still an aspiration. It’s a goal. 
It’s a mission. It’s a desire. So, either a problem they want to overcome or an 
aspiration, a thing they’re already good at, that they want to improve on. Do 
you understand the nature of the topic?  
 
 
I encourage you to find a partner that you’re willing to stay with for more 
than one round of this exercise, so if they smell don’t work with them. If no 
one works with you, please take a shower. That’s one that’s going to get 
loaded, isn’t it? You’re going to choose a partner in a moment, someone you’ll 
be sticking with because we’ll be coming back for a certain exercise with these 
same reiterations.  
 
 
You’ll choose a topic to explore. The topic will be either a problem that you 
want to overcome or something that you’re already good at that you want to 
get better at, enjoy more or do better. You get the idea, right? Then all you’re 
going to do is exactly like the previous exercise. You’re going to just explore 
that topic with your six question types and your assessing and deciding what 
you’re curious about and all that sort of stuff.  
 
 
The only thing I’m going to ask you to do is from time to time throw in some 
spatial predicates. Now the most useful places you may find to put them into 
are either when they’re stuck in a loop to get them deeper into the layer cake, 
so they get a richer response; or when they’re stuck on a problem – which is 
really the same thing just wearing a different coat.

Those may be particularly useful times but if you want you can try it in other 
areas too. The key here is seeing as you’ve been so conversational so far just 
asking this probing questions, can you do it in a way that they won’t even 
know you’re doing it, even though they know the words you’re looking for? 
 
 
In other words, can they be so engaged in the questions you’re asking that 
they neglect to realize you’ve actually put a spatial predicate into the mix? 
You may or may not be able to do that. I don’t really mind which way it goes. 
It’s more the challenge that is the important part. 
 
 
This is where trying does actually matter. Do you all understand the nature of 
this exercise? All right, put your hands up and find a partner. Then as soon as 
you find a partner, sit down and face quietly this way so that I know to begin. 
 
 
Did you enjoy that? Let’s jump right into the next segment, which will be time. 
Give me some time words. Just shout them out. What are some time 
predicates? 
 
 
MBL Power Words/Predicates: 
1. Space – Beyond, Aside, Inside, Over, Under, Anywhere, Through, 
Here, On Top Of, All Over, Next To, In Place Of, Beside 
2. Time – Now, Later, Then Before, After, Forever, Anytime, Never, Once 
Upon A Time, During, Soon, Eternally 
 
 
So, you have the idea that they are lots and lots of temporal predicates that 
you can use. Is that correct? Continue where your conversation left off. Switch 
roles in the same partnership. Continue where you left off, only this time 
focus on temporal predicators or mind bending power words of time. 
 
 
How did that go? Are you having fun? You’re deepening the fun. Are you 
breaking a few minds? Carry on. Let’s turn to the energy predicates. I started 
you off because these are a little bit more unusual.

Upon A Time, During, Soon, Eternally 
3. Energy – Totally, To The Extent, Absolutely, Completely, Anyway, 
Subtly, Partially, In Connection To, Relative To, Like, Only, Barely

What words have a quality about them that would give its amount, its size 
and all that sort of stuff? 
 
 
So, you get the idea that there are a number of things we can do with that. 
Once again, five minutes each with your partners. Focus on energy predicates 
in this round. Off you go. 
 
 
Let’s have some mics. We’re going to carry on in a second but I just want to 
make sure we throw in a couple of things here. Who’s finding it a little bit 
awkward to throw that language? For those of you, I just want to give you a 
very simple idea that hopefully will just simplify it. Would that be useful to 
you? 
 
 
Someone who would like a little assistance, please grab a mic. All you’re really 
doing is you’re doing what you’ve been doing all day anyways. We’re just 
going to throw some of these words in.  
 
 
Let’s take the energy words for now because they happen to be up. I’m just 
going to start the conversation because I don’t know what you were talking 
about. What was the topic of your conversation? What is your aspiration or 
problem? 
 
Student: I want to be more helpful and one of the things that’s kind of kept me from 
that in the past is because I feel very selfish. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here. The other stuff will come out and it is important, 
but before we go down that road what does being helpful mean to you? What 
will it do for you being helpful? 
 
Student: Being helpful to others. 
 
Igor: 
What does that mean to you? What does that do for you? 
 
Student: It’s extremely satisfying. 
 
Igor: 
Extremely satisfying, right? 
 
Student: Yes.

Igor: 
She’s just given me the mind bending word already – extremely. Does that 
belong on that list? You have a good unconscious mind. What would be even 
more satisfying than that? More? Do you see the question? It’s very simple. 
It’s very natural. I could have said what else is satisfying, but then I’d have to 
go into matter and then I’d be breaking the rules. 
 
Student: To also get the appropriate monetary compensation for that. 
 
Igor: 
To get the appropriate monetary compensation. That would be rewarding, 
wouldn’t it? 
 
Student: Doubly so, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Doubly so, right? How do you feel that’s rewarding, or should I say is that 
partially rewarding or is that totally rewarding?  
 
Student: It’s a part of it. It’s not the total sum of it. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, what is everything then? Do you see what’s going on? Does this sound 
like I’m asking any crazy questions or spinning around and spitting out their 
brains, going more brains please? Not really, right? It sounds like a genuine 
question – which it really is – and the only thing you’re doing is really the 
same six probing questions from before. You’re just throwing some of this 
stuff in here to loosen things up even further, especially when you get 
towards a stopping point. 
 
 
Do you want me to show you what I mean by a stopping point? So, what 
prevents you from being as helpful to others as you’d like to be, or are you 
beyond that already? Did you hear it? Why did I say it? Because I’m curious. I 
can see mind bending moments going on in there. 
 
 
Now I may not be correct but I’m throwing it out there because either it will 
be some goading and she’ll say no actually I’m just thinking it through clearly, 
or she’ll say yes this is weird, I can’t quite think of the problem anymore. 
Either way is fine for me because it’s just new stuff coming out, which is my 
new set of questions coming out. Do you understand what I mean by that?  
 
Student:  I was going in a different direction mentally, but then when you followed up… 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
386 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Exactly because I’ve hijacked your thinking down a different path. Are you 
beginning to appreciate now how simple spins, simple predicates timed well 
make all the difference? And that wasn’t mind bending at all, was it? Does 
that help? 
 
Student: It helps. Can I make a comment? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: One of the things that I noticed in the way that you pose the questions is 
they’re very brief, and this has come up here before. Every conversation that I 
had when I was asking questions or when I was the listener, the questions are 
always very long and even when there’s something happening the follow-up 
questions are very long, so I guess this is just one of the parts of perfecting 
the skill as we get more experienced.  
 
Igor: 
Just simplify it. Think of it this way. The only way you can ask a long question 
is to try to presuppose lots of short questions and put them into one.  
 
Student: What do you mean by that? 
 
Igor: 
Give me a long question. 
 
Student: What’s the meaning of your life? 
 
Igor: 
That’s not a long question. That’s quite a short one. It’s a big question but it’s 
short.  
 
Student: I do it unconsciously. I’m long-winded usually. 
 
Igor: 
If you can’t come up with a long question, that’s fine. I just want someone 
who’s got a nice long question ready, so I can show you what the answer to 
your question is. Does anyone have a long question ready? 
 
Student: I was thinking about how there are all kinds of types of people in the world, 
and so we have all these different sort of categories of people that exist in the 
world, and we meet those people throughout the course of our lives. 
Sometimes those people show up here and sometimes those people show up 
there. So, my question is when we meet those people if sometimes – well, if 
you’ve ever met you… 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
387 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
This is a great question. This is so nice. Let me just pause the question there 
because this is a phenomenal question. How might we break that down into 
shorter questions? Would it be fair to say that there are all kinds of people in 
this world?  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And you meet some of those people in some places and some of those people 
in other places. Is that fair? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Now when you meet certain people – I don’t even know where your question 
was going with this, so I’ll just make it up. If you think about the question that 
you were asking or that anyone is asking you’re trying to presuppose many 
different situations in order to get to your actual question.  
 
 
So, when I ask about each one of those little situations, I can get a nice little 
yes set going and even if you’re wrong with one of those things, actually it’s a 
good thing because you wouldn’t know which point of question was faulty if 
you put it all into one, whereas now you can fix the faulty bit if necessary. 
 
 
Did you find that helpful? That’s really all it is. If you have the capacity to ask 
long questions, it means you’re done because you can already think of five 
questions in one go. It means you’re free for at least the next five minutes, 
unless you change your mind halfway through because better questions occur 
to you, which is very reasonable.  
 
Student: I found in the previous days that when we had these question and answer 
rounds, actually very often I would run out of questions because my questions 
were all-encompassing, and they literally only allowed one answer and I was 
done. At one point Tom actually said I ran out of questions, but with this 
approach you take it in the little chunks. 
 
Igor: 
Right. To take that thought further, how on Earth can you possibly know what 
part of your question they’re answering when you’re just limiting them down 
to the answer you want to hear? You’re not really exploring their thinking. 
You’re more trying to shove them through a particular door. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
388 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
What we’re doing here is trying to explore their thinking. They can disagree at 
any part of that question. I don’t care because it will take us to where we 
need to go, and small questions are more precise because of it. 
 
Student: If I ask a very long question, I’m realizing now that I’m actually leading in a 
very specific direction. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. That’s an example of psychological leading. The question you were 
asking was beautiful. Did you all hear an insane amount of psychological 
leading going on? There’s an assumption that some people are this way and 
you meet some people in life over here, and then other people can be over 
there, and when you meet some people you do this.  
 
 
These are all leading statements. If you present each of these leading 
statements as an actual question, not only do you have more questions in 
your back pocket, but you’ll actually get a better quality of answers. Then you 
add this into it and suddenly it really is very, very simple. It’s actually a very 
small thing you need to do to get a very large effect. It’s a compounding 
effect.  
 
 
Think of it this way. The kind of questions you’re trying to ask is like making 
the world’s biggest pencil so that it doesn’t snap. Instead of finding the 
world’s biggest pencil – which is difficult to do – I’d rather go to the local 
hardware store or the local paper shop and buy out every single pencil they 
have in the shop and say one pencil, two pencils, three pencils, four pencils, 
five pencils. 
 
 
Eventually you won’t be able to snap the pencils anymore. Does the metaphor 
sit with you well? For those of you who had trouble with the exercise a 
moment ago, does that help resolve things a little bit for you? Are there any 
follow-up questions to that? Excellent. 
 
 
So, let’s get back to this. What are some predicates that fit the matter part of 
the equation?

MBL Power Words/Predicates: 
1. Space – Beyond, Aside, Inside, Over, Under, Anywhere, Through, 
Here, On Top Of, All Over, Next To, In Place Of, Beside 
2. Time – Now, Later, Then Before, After, Forever, Anytime, Never, Once 
Upon A Time, During, Soon, Eternally 
3. Energy – Totally, To The Extent, Absolutely, Completely, Anyway, 
Subtly, Partially, In Connection To, Relative To, Like, Only, Barely 
4. Matter – Each, All That, This, Other, Many, Next, Few, Everything, 
Only, What Else, Except, Any, One 
 
 
Solid is not one. Let’s put it in a sentence. Take each house and think about it; 
take solid house and think about it. It’s mind bending but it’s not a predicate. 
It’s a different quality of word. There’s nothing wrong with the word. It’s just 
not necessarily doing this. 
 
 
By the way, these are artificial categories purely to aid your thinking and to 
give you more choices and range. These are not the end all be all of 
expressing yourself. We’re just going full circle again so that your questioning 
skills become enriched. What are some others? 
 
 
So, we have lots of ideas. Again, this is not the exclusive list. This just gives 
you some directions to go in. Does everyone understand this one? Carry on 
with the same partners.  
 
 
Go back to the original A and B dynamic again. Use the same problem or 
aspiration that you’ve been talking about and just carry on that conversation, 
only now you’re focusing on predicates that matter. Come on, give me that 
one. Thank you. 
 
 
Who enjoyed that? Was it much better this time around once you got those 
little questioning things fixed and sorted out?  
 
Freestyle MBL 
 
Igor: 
What we’re going to do now is we’re going to do one last round of this, again 
five minutes apiece, only this time you get to go totally freestyle. To help you 
get freestyle, we will do this. The sySTEM is just a mnemonic. STEM stands for 
Space, Time, Energy and Matter, so it helps you play with those things. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
390 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Then you need to put some kind of negation in – but, yet, not – and you can 
put it in or not, or you can but if you don’t, you should, but not yet. Essentially 
you’re going totally freestyle.  
 
 
            sySTEM 
 
               + 
 
 
NOT (But…Yet…Etc) 
 
 
Freestyle on the question – just follow your curiosity; freestyle on the 
language – just throw something in or not as it seems appropriate, and just 
notice what the effect has when it does slip in and when it doesn’t. Are you 
ready for the last round? Same partners, same deal, first person go back in, 
same subject. Off you go, five minutes apiece. 
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How was that? Who enjoyed themselves? Who found that 
ridiculously easy to do? Now what I want you to do is compare how doing 
essentially the same exercise on day one compares to doing pretty much 
exactly the same exercise today?  
 
 
You had an experience of just doing essentially this freestyle on the first day if 
you recall, and we have one again now after having had two or three days of 
learning stuff in between. What kind of experiences have you had? What have 
you learned or, if nothing else, what have you been impressed by? 
 
Student: I was talking with David here and we had an intensely animated conversation 
that was just totally natural. I think we both had limitations that we realized 
were entirely self-imposed, and it was just like better than therapy and totally 
natural and simple. 
 
Igor: 
Right. This is how you have a chat with a friend, a colleague or just a random 
stranger and fix stuff. Thank you for that. Excellent. 
 
Student: I can be a little wordy sometimes and I found out after the first mind bending 
sentence or two that they really weren’t working very well for me, and I got 
kind of frustrated and just shut down.

From then on all my questions were all one, two or maybe three words, and it 
was just like wow. I didn’t even ask a question. I just put a question word out 
there and they made the questions up themselves that they needed. That was 
kind of amazing. 
 
Igor: 
Really this is a case of less is more. One of the biggest problems that I see with 
Mind Bending Language is people trying to do way, way, way too much. 
Learning that just a little bit of subtle spin here can just totally just go whoosh.  
 
 
That is a real gift. That’s when you’ve really gone from competent to really 
getting into advanced and even into the master program. So, congratulations. 
Well done. Give him a round of applause for that. 
 
Student: I found that just being listened to – Barbara just listening to me – my 
creativity just started to unfold. Ideas just started flowing in. So, thank you 
Barbara. 
 
Igor: 
That’s awesome. Well done.  
 
Student: Having gone through all the probing questions one category at a time was 
very helpful and having those tools available for our conversation, and it 
made it easier for me to think about the directions that I wanted the 
conversation to go in… 
 
Igor: 
Because now you’re more strategic, right? You have a sense of oh there’s 
more juice here, there’s less there. You can have a distinction in your own 
mind, right? 
 
Student: Yes, and so I found it very easy to direct not only his thinking but his 
emotional state in the directions that I wanted it to go at different times.  
 
Igor: 
Good job. Well done. That’s awesome. Give her a round of applause.  
 
Student: An awesome experience, first of all. We went through stages like you had 
suggested us to do, but we were way ahead of the game. We couldn’t stop it. 
It was automatic almost. We were thinking of these things and we weren’t 
trying to do anything and it just occurred and it was a nice experience, a 
totally different level of connection with somebody. 
 
Igor: 
It’s very freeing, isn’t it? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
392 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: It is, absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
It’s very freeing to be able to get that level of interaction without having to 
have some clumsy mechanical thing which kind of falls apart on you. 
Student: We’re not trying anymore. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Excellent. Good job. Great job.  
 
Student: I was actually amazed at how easy and simple, how extraordinarily deep it 
went. Is it okay if I share, Hazel? I put her in a rabbit hole and I was waiting for 
the answer, and nothing. I waited and waited and waited and I thought the 10 
minutes was going to be up, and when she did come out of it she said it was 
pure feeling and here’s where I felt it in my body. I was going woo-hoo. 
 
Igor: 
It’s powerful stuff, isn’t it? Let me ask you this because this is an appropriate 
time to ask this. Could you call that a hypnotic trance that she went into? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
It was at least a significantly altered state, was it not? 
 
Student: For both of us. 
 
Igor: 
Right. This is what we call the trance of infinite possibilities, and now you guys 
have had experiences of just what infinite really means. Thank you for that. 
That’s excellent. 
 
Student: It was interesting because when we started with each set of words, we kept 
our questions simple and we gained a lot of information. Then at the end 
when you said put it all together, then I could tie it together and make a little 
pressure and give them all of those spins of what would it be like then if you 
did that now and you hadn’t done it before. What would it be like if you did 
that? That’s when I got the final spin and they went internal instead of being 
just external mostly when we did each word by itself.  
 
Igor: 
Right and you know how to do that because it felt natural at the time, did it 
not? 
 
Student: Yes. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
393 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. That was psychological leading, by the way. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: For me it was quite magical because I think I went into that trance of infinite 
possibilities. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. 
 
Student: And because Sasha seems to be very good at the questions, but I think the 
feeling I got is that you don’t really have to consciously think about any 
question – what is it I’m going to ask – because what the other person is 
saying is creating a question. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I could not agree with you more. That tells me that you’re really 
getting this. That is the heart of the whole matter. 
 
Student: Thank you, and thank you Sasha. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Actually that deserves a round of applause because that’s a huge 
realization.  
 
Student: I found as we were working, I would occasionally notice that I was using some 
of the Mind Bending Language. I suspect I was using it a lot more often than 
that, but I didn’t notice and my partner didn’t notice either.  
 
Igor: 
That’s perfect. When you don’t realize you’re doing it, that’s when you’re 
doing it the best. That’s part of the package that comes with mastery. From 
time to time you still do it on purpose for practice sake, but the point is to be 
able to let go of it and it takes care of itself and it evolves by itself. Excellent 
job. Thank you for that. 
 
Jules: 
Something really interesting happened in this one. Not only did the 
conversation flow at such a level that there was never a gone into the rabbit 
hole, but there were more significant shifts in myself in particular, and 
perhaps in my partner, than in any other conversation this weekend.  
 
 
One of the things I noticed is that as we were trying to use the sySTEM 
predicates, the choice of a sySTEM predicate would take the thought into a 
certain direction, and as we let go of that the sySTEM predicates began to be 
used to describe where we were already going rather than direct the thought. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
394 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Once that happened, it was totally easy and rather than leaving someone in 
the TIP – which many of the spins can do – the pop in and out throughout the 
conversation led to much, much deeper realizations of what was going on 
within both of us, as the questioner and as the person receiving the question. 
 
Igor: 
Plus it also feels like a more regular genuine conversation because we don’t 
spend most of our conversation like this for 10 minutes at a time. If someone 
spends 10 or 15 minutes like that in your presence, they’ll know you’re doing 
something. However, if you pop in and out like that, every now and again 
they’ll spend a minute or so going that’s just really curious.  
 
 
That’s a very different thing and the more you can make it natural like that, 
everyone in the outside world will look at you and think you’re just having a 
regular conversation or a very intimate conversation, but you will know that 
what you’re doing is fundamentally hypnotic because you’re accessing 
different parts of the mind and you can read that now rather eloquently, 
right? So, thank you for that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: I’ve really noticed a difference in my listening. I know I’ve always had a really 
bad habit of interrupting people. Now when I interrupt somebody, it is 
because I really recognize a significant moment and I need to get on it right at 
that time. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. That answers the question that someone else asked on day one, 
which is how do you know when to interrupt and so on? Whoever it was, you 
now have the answer. Basically the conversation tells you when, and that 
relevancy thing, that significance thing is huge. Good job. Well done.  
 
 
I think you should all be very self-satisfied at this point because you’ve 
achieved a significant step. Now that we’ve got this, really this is the pinnacle 
of all the work we’ve been doing for the last three and half days now.  
 
 
Based on this, we can now go forwards and actually start applying it to 
specific kinds of contexts, situations and so on and getting more strategic with 
it, etc. Who would like to have more of a strategic sense in terms of how, 
when, what and where you do things? Excellent. That means you should really 
be back in time after lunch.

The RIP Formula 
 
Igor: 
As the infamous phrase goes, how was lunch? That’s so enthusiastic. You 
must have really enjoyed lunchtime today. Who’s finding themselves asking 
more and more interesting questions and having more interesting 
conversations over lunchtime, just in your private time? 
 
 
It’s important because these are skills that are general life skills, but of course 
when it comes to the influencing process they will be particularly important as 
well. What we’ve done up to this point is we’ve created all the building blocks 
on which this palace called influence will be built. 
 
 
Before the lunch break, you put them all together and you already started 
finding yourselves being very influential without a particular set of strategies 
in place yet. Would that be fair to say?  
 
 
What I want to do a little bit now is I’d like to focus over the rest of today and 
maybe a little bit of tomorrow on five key strategies or tactics that I find 
myself using over and over again, one of which has been refined with the help 
of some of our licensed trainers who went out in the field and actually started 
using this. 
 
 
Remember I mentioned the five-minute sales process? I’d like to show you 
how to use the skills you already have for the five-minute sales process, as 
well as some other things that will help you within the influence cycle. Would 
that be of use to you? Wouldn’t that be interesting? 
 
 
Let’s get some microphones over here in case we need them. When do you 
need to influence someone? When you say to them let’s go to the cinema and 
they say yes, or do you want to buy this and they say sure? Or when you say 
do you want to buy this and they say oh I don’t know about that? When is 
there actually a time for you actually use some kind of influence process? 
That’s called a psychologically leading question.  
 
Student: When you’re not getting the results that you want. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, if you can get the result plainly just by asking for it, do you really 
need to engage in any kind of influential process? No, it’s just a matter of 
asking for it. Can you do this? Yes. Done. Why waste time and effort doing 
things the hard way when it’s already done, right?

By definition the only time we really think about wanting to be more 
influential is when the regular style of interaction doesn’t work anymore. 
There’s a problem. Someone’s stuck in some way. This is should be a no 
brainer by this stage. 
 
 
So, I’ve come up with a little formula which has been refined. It’s a very 
simple formula but there are a lot of interesting bits inside of it, which will 
hopefully lay these kinds of problems and obstacles to rest forever. Tongue-
in-cheekly – and you’ll know why I say this now – we’ll call it the RIP formula. 
 
 
 
RIP Formula: 
 
 
Rapport 
 
 
Investigate 
 
 
Problem Destroyer 
 
 
For those of you who have any kind of religious background, they may rest in 
peace, but in this case we are the funeral directors of influence company now. 
It’s just three simple steps. The first step of this really is a skill that we’ve 
indirectly been covering.  
 
1. The ability to build rapport with people. 
 
 
There are many different skills to do that. The ones you’ve developed in here 
are more than functional. This is a topic that on its own we could easily spend 
a week or two discussing and then practicing, but let’s take that as a given for 
now. 
 
 
Once you’ve got into the rapport stage, you have to create some kind of a 
segue, open the subject or introduce the idea that you want to be influential 
about, and then you go into what has become hopefully one of your strengths 
right now, which is: 
 
2. The investigation phase. 
 
 
What do you think you might want to do during the investigation phase?  
 
Student: You might want to find out what it is they are looking for or what it is they 
want. 
 
Igor: 
To make matters really simple, the investigation phase looks like that.

Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
5. Inferences & Conclusions 
6. Implications & Consequences 
 
 
It’s really all the questions you’ve been asking for the last six days. You’re 
trying to identify their motivation, the context, the driving questions and 
answers and so on. 
 
 
Tomorrow we’ll talk more about how to shortcut this, but for now let’s 
assume that time is not an issue and we can spend 20 minutes or a half an 
hour. I mean let’s face it. How long have you really spent talking to each other 
to get to these profound layers in your own experiences? 
 
 
It’s really only been a matter of 10, 15 or 20 minutes, hasn’t it? So, you 
investigate using the kind of skills you already have and then finally you’ve 
identified in that investigation process first of all where it is their thinking is 
stuck, what kind of ideas do they have present that are getting in the way, 
what motivations do they need to be redirected so that it becomes useful to 
them and so on. 
 
 
That’s where the final stage comes in: 
 
3. The problem destroyers. 
 
 
At this point, you basically just take whatever obstacles are there and you 
destroy them. I’d like to run you through five of these destroyers, and the first 
four will actually be very easy for you because they’re just a particular version 
of what we’ve been doing anyway. You’ve actually done this without 
necessarily realizing it. That’s why we waited until today to talk about this. 
 
 
 
Problem Destoyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
 
 
The first of the problem destroyers I call the choice multiplier. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
398 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The choice multiplier really is creating an open-ended experience so that 
people have more choices about what they can do, and then you can select 
one of them.  
 
 
In terms of the language, think of it this way. Can I give you a very short spin 
to give you the essence of the choice multiplier?  
 
 What are all the options you have right now to influence someone, and 
of all those ways which is the one that seems the most attractive to 
you right now? 
 
 
Notice the choice multiplier opens up lots and lots of options, and it contrasts 
that then down to closing it back down to one practical step, one practical 
option and so on, and that one will of course end up being the one that you 
have. 
 
 
Remember we talked about one of the students who was a gay pride and just 
raised an eyebrow and that changed things around? Isn’t that an example of 
multiplying the person’s choices and simultaneously increasing choices and 
collapsing it back down to one? The increasing of choices was I don’t have to 
just be afraid of talking to my parents. The collapsing it back down to one was 
the actual behavior of you know what, I will talk to my parents about this.  
 
 
If you recall a lot of the question and answer sessions we’ve had here – 
weren’t those questions answered with increasing their choices and then 
coming down to one or maybe two actual things they’ll be doing? So, you get 
this idea of language that opens them up – all, every, everything, everywhere 
– and then collapsing it down to only, one, this, that and so on. 
 
 
What I want to do now is I want you to have a little experience of this as we 
go along. In a moment we’re going to stand up. Remember that mingling 
exercise we did at the beginning of the whole crazy ride all those weeks ago? 
I’d like you to go around and just introduce yourselves to people again, just 
shake hands and say how’s it going, what are you doing here and so on. 
 
 
Then somewhere in your little conversation – and please keep it brief because 
you’ll want to be doing it with several people – I’d like you to go from the 
rapport to the investigation stage.

To do this very simply, just say it’s really nice to meet you. Whenever I’m at an 
event like this I always have a curious question to ask people. Is it okay if I ask 
you this? They’ll say yes. You can frame it any way you wish. If there’s one 
thing that you could change or improve in your life, what would that be? 
 
 
Then go into your investigation phase for just a minute or so and be curious 
about at what point will you start throwing in language that opens them up to 
more choices, to multiply their choices, and then see what happens. The fact 
is you’ve already done this at some point over the last four days. It’s just a 
question of doing it consistently here now in the next exercise. 
 
 
Do you understand the nature of what we’re doing here? Who’s ready to do 
that now? Four people? That means the rest of you better meet those four 
people because they’ll help you with your inhibitions to doing the exercise. 
Stand up. Remember the magic word because we’ll be needing it when we 
come back for the next thing. 
 
 
All I’m going to ask you to do is walk around and meet as many different 
people as possible. You’ll have about five or six minutes to do that. I’d like you 
to get through at least three people. That means you’ve got like two minutes 
apiece at the most. If you can faster, that’s even better, so you get more 
experiences of doing this. 
 
 
You don’t have to be particular eloquent with it but I would like you to be 
conversational with it. Once again, the three step are build rapport – hey, who 
are you, why are you here, how did you come here, where are you from?  
 
 
Then make a segue into the investigation – if there’s one thing that you’d like 
to improve or fix in your life, what would that be? Then ask whatever 
questions come to mind around that, and as you’re doing that see if you can 
fit in language that increases their choices in relation to whatever that is. Off 
you go. 
 
 
How did you like the choice multiplier? What kinds of things did you notice? 
What kinds of things happened? 
 
Student: I noticed that it’s really quick. 
 
Igor: 
It can be incredibly fast. Did anyone else notice that?

Student: It’s incredibly fast. 
 
Igor: 
To be fair, part of it is also that you guys have been doing a lot of thinking 
over the last few days, so that speeds things up also. Once you get someone 
to the right state of mind and you get to the right layer of the layer cake, then 
the choices multiply like rabbits. Just think on that one fully. 
 
Student: I made a point of talking to people that I haven’t talked to yet, and the 
rapport, the investigative questions and everything were also very quick. I was 
just surprised how quickly you were able to get to that level with somebody 
who was – I mean we’ve been in the same room but basically they were still 
strangers. 
 
Igor: 
Right, and partly it’s because we’ve created an atmosphere in the room, 
which is admittedly going to be part of it. However, when you start blending 
the rapport stage with the investigation stage – in other words the kinds of 
questions you’re asking – as you’ve discovered very quickly, mindbending 
language and these kinds of probes when done gently and subtly can very 
quickly break through their shells. So, that’s excellent. Very, very good.  
 
Student: I have a question. With something like selling a car – let’s put it in that context 
– how would the choice multiplier be applied to that? 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. First you’ve got to give me a context more than just selling a car. 
You’ve got to actually have a problem. I’ll just give you a classic one or you 
can give me one if you prefer as well. A classic problem is it costs too much. 
 
 
So, you investigate what do mean it costs too much? Well, it’s $100,000 and I 
only have $50,000 in my budget. So, what exactly do you want this car to do 
for $50,000? You just do a little bit of investigating around that. 
 
 
Then you say given the budget you have and the money you haven’t realized 
you still have available, what are all the options you have available in terms of 
the cars you can get, including getting a more expensive car that does more or 
a cheaper car that does less? And beyond those choices, there’s something 
right in between that will fit you. Do you get where we’re going with this? 
 
Student: Yes, that spun my head around.

Igor: 
Right. Notice something else, which is actually what we’re going to come onto 
in a second as a follow-up to this exercise. I don’t just want to throw out lots 
of choices because you can actually be overloaded with choices, and a lot of 
people when they have too many choices will just bow out and say I can’t do 
anything. They freeze. 
 
 
So, really the art here is to create a choice of one. By that I don’t mean where 
you say this is only one choice for you. I’ll give it to you in a slightly 
mindbending way. Of all the choices available to you, what’s the one that will 
really fit here? 
 
 
I’m doing it a little bit backwards. Actually we’ll come onto a sales cycle later, 
which will refine this much more but let’s go crude on this if that’s okay with 
you, just as a principle. Of all the choices of cars and all the price points you 
have available to you, which of the cars you’ve seen so far most fit what you 
need? Do you see how we’ve collapsed it from all their choices down to one?  
 
 
Well, it would be this one over here. Okay, what is it about this car that finds 
the right balance between what the car does and what the car costs? Again, 
I’m not suggesting that’s the only way to handle that conversation. There may 
actually be better ones.  
 
 
We haven’t dealt with some of the other elements, but what I’m more 
interested in here right now is the effect of the choice multiplier and 
collapsing it back down to the choice of one. They made the choice. I didn’t 
make it for them. I just helped to define the parameters within that. Does that 
help? Are there any other questions on that? 
 
Student: I think in my case it was a question of the blind leading the blind. Charlie’s 
new into hypnotherapy and I’m practically a newborn. He said he would like 
to make the business a success, so we tried to touch upon things, but there 
was absolutely nothing that I could give him as feedback. 
 
 
My problem was like what’s my choice, and I said I would like to have a better 
short-term memory because I’m in the golden years and it’s having its effect, 
and unfortunately he’s in the same boat, so we couldn’t help each other. 
 
Igor: 
This is actually a very important point. There is an assumption that has been 
made here. Can you hear it? What is the assumption? That you have to have 
knowledge about a topic before you can help someone through it. We’ll go 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
402 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
one step further than that, which is to say that the way to help people 
through problems is to give them advice. 
 
 
By the way, there’s nothing wrong with giving them advice but the advice 
comes at the end of creating choices. That’s when the advice comes. To take 
the example over here again, what are all the options you have available to 
you in terms of cars that meet your price range, and thinking about all those 
things right now, which of these cars comes closest to that? It’s the all or one 
collapsing thing. 
 
 
Let me put it another way to you. If you recall, I started as an executive coach 
at the age of about 27. My average client was in his late 40’s or early 50’s. I 
haven’t even come close today compared to where they were at because they 
were running multinational, multibillion dollar industries.  
 
 
Do I have any knowledge about their business? No. Do I have any knowledge 
about their business method? No. I have some knowledge about people, 
which is definitely useful, but really the biggest ace I had to play – and this is 
really where the birthplace of all conversational hypnosis in terms of our 
sySTEM has come from – was I knew one thing beyond everything else. 
 
 
Inside everyone’s mind they have all the resources they need, all the tools 
they need to solve their own problems, and that’s the only thing I had to do. 
Let’s take this idea of short-term memory. Aside from all the things you’ve 
forgotten, what are all the things you can remember? 
 
Student: I remember a lot from the olden days, but ask me what did I have for 
breakfast and I have no clue. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, you misunderstand. I’m sorry. I didn’t actually mean that. I understand 
you’ve got great memories of the old days. That’s your long-term memory. 
When it comes to your short-term memory, there are many things you’ve 
forgotten and you know about that of course, but what are all the things you 
do remember? For example, you know what’s happening right now. 
 
Student: Yes, I remember things like I’m not in a state of dementia.  
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you a second. Did you see what just happened there? It was 
subtle but did you see the shift? Did you see how he lit up a little bit? Would 
you say we’ve just opened a door, which gets him closer to memory, or have 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
403 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
we closed the door that gets him closer to short-term memory? We’ve 
opened it. So, there are some things you do remember relatively easily. 
Would that be fair to say? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, there are some things you can remember and there are other 
things that you don’t. Is that correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
How important are the things that you remember compared to the ones that 
you don’t? 
 
Student: That depends. 
 
Igor: 
It depends. 
 
Student: Yes, but generally during the course of the day, routine things you do, and you 
forget. One day I forgot my wife and she was very angry about it. 
 
Igor: 
When you say you forgot your wife, are you meaning that you forgot you had 
a wife, you forgot where your wife was or you forgot that your wife was 
present and you moved on somewhere else? 
 
Student: I was supposed to pick her up from a certain place and it just went away. 
 
Igor: 
So, what you’re saying to me is not so much that you’re forgetting things. It’s 
just that there are certain things you wish to be able to encode in a way that’s 
easy for you to access when you want to access that – in other words some 
things that are more important than others, right? 
 
 
This is a little timeout here. Notice how what we’re doing now is just trying to 
break through assumptions to get there. We haven’t quite gotten to the 
opening, to the choice multipliers. 
 
 
I can do something a little artificially if you want me to, but I’d have to do a 
little more investigating to open that up properly. I can do something 
artificial. For example, what are all the other ways to remember things other 
than the one that you’ve used so far?

Student: I know most of the sort of mnemonic techniques you have to do. Like at the 
moment I memorize something and then I know it. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, if I understand you correctly, when you make the effort, if you 
have the attention on memorizing something, you can. Is that correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Did you see what just happened here again? Now we’re actually 
going to go into the next one a little bit. Why not? 
Student: The problem is it doesn’t last. 
 
Igor: 
Well, of course it doesn’t last. It’s short term. Now is your problem with the 
short-term memory or the long-term memory? Which is it? Or, is it a question 
of moving the important things from short-term memory to long-term 
memory? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, now we’re defining the problem a little bit more closely. Really if I 
understand you correctly, you don’t have a problem with short-term memory. 
You just have an issue figuring out how to get that short-term memory to stick 
in the long-term memory when you really need it to. Is that right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. Timeout. I don’t want to go down this path. I’ll give you some 
advice at this level if you want.  
 
Student: Yes, please. 
 
Igor: 
It’s actually a relatively simple matter but it may require a little bit more 
talking for us to actually make it easy for you. Short-term memory works one 
way and the mnemonic devices for example that you know help that 
incredibly. Long-term memory works another way.  
 
 
The simplest way to move short-term memory to long-term memory is to go 
through a six-step cycle. In other words, you think about whatever you want 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
405 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
to memorize right now and do whatever mnemonic you have, and it’s there 
for anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes relatively easily, correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
At the end of that 60-minute period, you take an hour break. At the end of 
that 60-minute period, you quickly review it. It could take seconds for short 
bits and it takes minutes for longer bits. It may take you an hour or so to 
memorize it initially and then it will take you a couple of minutes to review it 
an hour later.  
 
 
You repeat it again six hours later, a day later, a week later, a month later, 
three months later. At the six-month mark, it’s in your permanent memory. 
That’s how memory works. That’s the short answer to the other question. 
 
Student: I know that method but there’s just one problem presently.  
 
Igor: 
What’s that? 
 
Student: I memorize something and now I know I have to review it let’s say after one 
hour, and it’s not there after one hour. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the whole point of reviewing it.  
 
Student: Yes, but I’ve determined now that within the hour I have to review it, but 
when the hour comes I don’t remember that I have to review it.  
 
Igor: 
Right, so you’re telling me all you need is a habit of reviewing things. Is that 
what you’re saying? 
 
Student: I used to have the habit but it doesn’t work anymore. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. He’s just given us a resource, right? It’s just creating a habit. You 
used to have it, so then really at some point in time you were able to do it. 
Then you did something to stop and as soon as you go back to being able to 
do it again, you’ll be happy. Is that right? 
 
Student: I think so.

Igor: 
What are some of the ways you haven’t thought of yet to go back to the way 
you used to do things? Once again, did you see the choice multiplying? Do you 
get a sense of where we’re going with this? Is it okay if we pause it at that 
point? As much as I would like to fix it, I’d rather get on with doing more of 
the seminar and then maybe we can have a chat in private to add more to 
that, but we need to go through the cycles.  
 
 
It doesn’t matter if you have an answer to it or not. In this case, I happen to 
know a little bit about memory to help out with that. What’s more important 
here is he’ll give you the answers. Even if didn’t have any memory knowledge, 
I find out what do you know about memory. I just have to take longer to 
figure that out. Then I figured out he’s got a tool, which is mnemonics.  
 
 
We also figured out that he used to be able to review things quite easily. He’s 
fallen out of the habit somehow and now it’s just a question of getting back 
into the habit and getting some tools to do that, which is where choice 
multiplying really helps. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, thank you. Can you talk to my wife so that she doesn’t get a complex I’m 
ignoring her. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, you can. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other questions before we carry on here?  
 
Student: What have you got in your product in this? With choice multipliers I don’t 
know what you have. 
 
Igor: 
How do you mean? 
 
Student: We’re on a sales model right now. 
 
Igor: 
We’re not on the sales model right now. We’ll come onto the sales model 
later on either today or tomorrow. I’m not sure yet. 
 
Student: Okay.

Igor: 
I’m going to give you four very common maneuvers that I like to use in terms 
of whether it’s therapeutic, or coaching someone, or helping someone out, or 
influencing them in terms of getting over a stuck idea and then when you 
have those four in place, we’ll actually look at the sales cycle.  
 
 
Hence, in terms of the sales process, this is a little bit clunkier. It will fit in and 
it will make more sense then, but right now we’re just at training wheels in 
terms of the influence cycle as its own thing. Are there any other comments 
or questions? 
 
Student: Thank you. When I was working with my partner, he wanted to work with 
mindbending techniques to improve his sales letter, to improve his technique. 
I kept trying to get him to open to broaden his horizons with other things that 
will be complementary and that’s all he wanted to work on, and I got 
frustrated and then I realized afterwards I could have broadened the choices 
within where he preferred to work. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. It’s a great learning because now you see what happens when you try 
to stick your fish in their dreams but there is so much choice, and this is the 
funny part.  
 
 
If you expand the category of mindbending language – in other words these 
choices within mindbending language – chances are he’ll start seeing 
mindbending languages in areas he never thought they’d be. So, you still get 
to the outcome you had in mind, just through a different route. Is this useful?  
 
 
I’d like to just do one quicker version of this exercise, just a two-minute 
version, so you’ll just have one person you’ll do this with. You’ll do exactly the 
same exercise again – the choice multiplier – only this time I’d like you to go 
broad, open the categories. What are all the choices available to you? 
 
 
Let them think and scan through it. They may or may not have a concrete 
answer. That’s irrelevant. It’s the fact they’re scanning around in that. Then 
collapse it down to one – of all those possibilities that are available to you, 
which one seems the most appealing, or which one jumps right at you right 
now, which one can you do at this point, what’s the only thing that you need 
to do at this point to make all that happen? 
 
 
Do you get the idea of where we’re going with this? The choice multiplier is 
about opening and closing choices, opening them up for selection and then 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
408 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
helping them make that selection so that an intuitive one comes out. Is that 
easy to do? Alright, on your feet, let’s spend two or three minutes doing that 
quickly. 
 
 
I realize that some of you did both versions of the exercise the first time, so 
you basically just did the same exercise twice. That means you just did more 
the first time. Well done.  
 
 
For those of you who did just the opening up of choices the first time around, 
and then followed up with the opening up and then going down to one choice 
the second time around, how did those two experiences compare and 
contrast to each other? Hopefully you have some ideas because you just had 
the experience. 
 
Student: My partner gave me choices. As he helped me single out one choice, I went 
just looking back and I went much deeper in a trace with the broadened 
arrow. Just thinking of it now, I was very deep in a trance at that point. 
 
Igor: 
What tends to happen is all the energy you collect in going wide into all the 
possibilities then collects into the one idea, the one possibility, and hence it 
becomes much more supercharged. That’s one of the advantages of going 
wide and then going narrow right afterwards. 
 
 
The other thing that happens is you’re more likely motivated because let’s 
face it, can you do 100 things at the same time? No, but you can do one thing, 
and one of the biggest problems we have in motivating behavior is people are 
overloaded and say I don’t know which one to start. I don’t know where to 
begin? 
 
 
You can remove that as a hurdle. One of the simplest things you can do in 
terms of motivating any kind of behavior is – and you’ll understand the nature 
of this mindbending question now – what is the smallest thing you can do 
right now to take you in that direction? 
 
 
Let me give you an example. How many people here want to start a 
hypnotherapy business or want to flourish in one right now? Very good. Any 
one of you stand up. The first one standing up gets the mic. Have you already 
started a hypnotherapy practice or not? 
 
Student: Yes, a small one.

Igor: 
Excellent. How long have you been running it?  
 
Student: About eight months. 
 
Igor: 
About eight months and how is it going, just roughly? 
 
Student: It’s good. I had a bit of a stop in the summer. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, you had a bit of a slump but overall it’s going okay. You just want it to 
be a lot better, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I’ll just go the clunky way just for the sake of brevity. So, if you think about all 
the things you’ve already done in your business, many of them have worked, 
some of them have not, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, many things have worked and some have not. Now aside from all those 
things, what are all the things you haven’t even considered yet? And as you 
think about all that, there’s at least one thing that comes to mind, isn’t there? 
 
Student: Not yet. 
 
Igor: 
Not yet. Really consider it. What are all the things you haven’t even tried yet? 
And of all those things, there should be at least one that comes to mind.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What’s that? 
 
Student: Just being more active in it. 
 
Igor: 
Being more active? 
 
Student: More active in the pursuit of it.

Igor: 
Okay, so basically being more active, putting more energy into the business 
and that sort of stuff, is that correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I’m curious then, what is the one thing you could do right now to be more 
active in your business? 
 
Student: Well, I could go home and just start peddling my services more instead of 
having… 
 
Igor: 
Okay, how would that look? How would going home at the end of the day, not 
right this second… 
 
Student: Oh, I can’t go now? 
 
Igor: 
So, if you were to go home at the end of the day today and you start, as you 
call it, peddling your services – although I suspect it’s much better than that – 
what would that look like? What would be one action you could take, for 
example? 
 
Student: I think more communications and more letting people be aware that I have a 
service to offer. 
 
Igor: 
Just a little timeout. Did you see how I’m still getting big picture things? Do I 
have my one thing yet? No, and that’s why he hasn’t been doing it. What does 
more communication mean? Give an example of one thing you could actually 
do to communicate better like that? 
 
Student: Let people know that I’m actually available as a hypnotherapist. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, which people would you let know that? 
 
Student: Well, in a small town of 250, it’s just about everybody. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, so you’d knock on everyone’s door tonight and tell them hey I’m available 
as a hypnotherapist if you’d like. Is that what you’re telling me? 
 
Student: It could be one way, but I probably wouldn’t do it that way.

Igor: 
So, let’s go back to the idea of a smaller step. What is the smallest thing you 
can do tonight to actually let people in your area know that you’re available 
as a hypnotherapist? 
 
Student: That would be to sit down and make a plan. 
 
Igor: 
That would be a good idea, wouldn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes, that would be a very good idea. 
 
Igor: 
Do you see the nature of what we’re doing here? Let me ask you this. How 
motivated are you right now to do a plan, even though we haven’t really done 
any crazy juju on this yet for the sake of brevity, but just based on what we’ve 
talked about so far? 
 
Student: I’m reasonably motivated. 
 
Igor: 
Why is that? 
 
Student: Because it’s something I want. 
 
Igor: 
Really?  
 
Student: Yes, motivated. 
 
Igor: 
Why is it you want to talk to these people? 
 
Student: Why do I want to talk to them? Why do I want to peddle my services or why 
do I want to help them? 
 
Igor: 
What’s the difference between the two? I hear there might be some 
difference there. 
 
Student: The difference is one I’m offering a service, and two I’m actually delivering it. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, I see. So, talking to them means you’re delivering a service. Is that what 
you’re saying? 
 
Student: No.

Igor: 
Okay then please correct me. 
 
Student: I guess maybe we could call it advertising and actualizing. 
 
Igor: 
So, when you’re talking about making a plan tonight, what would that plan be 
for? 
 
Student: That would be more on the advertising end of it. 
 
Igor: 
More on the advertising, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you like advertising? 
 
Student: It’s not my favorite thing. 
 
Igor: 
Right, there’s the other problem right there. So, in terms of all the ways you 
have of getting your message out to that small community you talked about, 
what are all the choices you have available to you, including advertising of 
course? 
 
Student: Yes, advertising. Mostly in a small community where everybody knows me, it’s 
just a matter of gaining their trust. 
 
Igor: 
And how can you do that? 
 
Student: I think mostly by speaking with them. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so if I hear you correctly – and please correct me if I’m wrong – are you 
suggesting that just talking to people in your community will get you better 
results than advertising at this point because you build trust? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Now how enthused would you be about talking to people compared to 
advertising to them? 
 
Student: Probably more so.

Igor: 
So, if you wanted to make a plan tonight, would you prefer to plan to 
advertise or plan to just talk with them and build trust? 
 
Student: It would be for talking, which I guess you could call advertising but in a 
different… 
 
Igor: 
It’s just a different mindset around that, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, comparing your motivation now to a moment ago, where would that be? 
 
Student: Probably a bit higher. It’s a little clearer now what I probably need to do. 
Therefore when things are clearer, it’s easy to be motivated. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Again a little timeout. We’re not complete in the cycle. You can hear 
that, right? But again I don’t want to take too much time for this. I just want 
to get the principle across. You heard at least two versions of the opening and 
closing, and each time you felt the motivation changing. Would that be fair to 
say? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, do you get this idea of the choice multiplier – opening choices and closing 
choices? Thank you very much. Give him a nice round of applause.  
 
Student: You seem to be doing more of another technique there. I mean there was the 
opening choice and closing choice but once you were there, then you started 
comparing the two, almost like… 
 
Igor: 
We’re doing something else. That’s actually what we’ll come onto right after 
the break.  
 
Student: It’s almost like this Non-Awareness Set type deal or something. 
 
Igor: 
Very perceptive. Would you like to know what that is?  
 
Student: Yes, I would.

In exactly 15 minutes, I’ll tell you that because we want to have a break first. I 
think people need a little bit of fresh air, right?

DVD 13 – “The Contradiction Blowout”, Choice 
Multipliers & Problem Destroyers 
 
 
Problem Destroyers 
 
Igor: 
What I want to do now and pretty much putting into the tail end of today so 
that we can finish in time before our brains are all fried, is carry on with a 
couple more of these problem destroyers. I think there are two more that I 
want to have today and we’ll have a few more tomorrow. 
 
 
I appreciate that these last couple of exercises have been a little bit on the 
fast side. Would that be fair to say? That process will continue. For the next 
couple of exercises, there will be similar time constraints.  
 
 
The reason primarily is I want you to just have a small bite-sized experience 
first, and then we’ll expand it and give you a much more satisfying experience 
of it. Is it okay to rush yourselves through it a little bit and to get a little clunky 
with it again just to acquire the distinction that we’re talking about here, so 
that when we come back to it at the end of the day, you will have more time 
and really get to appreciate these maneuvers in their full and natural glory? 
 
 
Was that a leading question? Yes? Is this a leading question? Are you 
beginning to understand the distinctions between different styles of 
questions? So, you understand the choice multiplier more or less as a 
principle and you’ve had a few goes at that.   
 
 
What I want to do now is go to the next one. Let’s have a quick chat about this 
one.  
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
 
 
I call this the contradiction blowout. Which of these probing questions is the 
most likely place for you to have meaty ideas for the choice blowout?  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
416 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
5. Inferences & Conclusions 
6. Implications & Consequences 
 
 
 
Number three – driving questions and answers, absolutely. If they haven’t any 
questions they’re not really going very far. Number four – concepts, 
assumptions, opinions and so on. Those are the two key areas where you’re 
going to find very rich territory for the choice multipliers. 
 
 
It’s not to say by the way that you won’t find it in motivation or in inferences 
and so on. It’s just we’re looking for the most likely hunting ground. Similarly, 
for the contradiction blowout, inferences and conclusions and somewhat 
implications and consequences will be the most fertile hunting ground. Of 
course you’ll find opportunities in the other places too.  
 
 
So, what do I mean by contradiction blowout? Do you recall when we had 
Amir role playing a client that had no motivation? Do you recall there was a 
specific maneuver that I engaged in to basically do what in some circles is 
called a bind or a double bind to bind him to get his motivation back?  
 
 
That’s what I call a contradiction blowout. When they’ve concluded 
something and say this is what it is and then you use that as a leverage point 
for something else, it blows out. The most direct example you’ve seen so far 
was actually with Devin the other day when he wanted to change his 
communication style, so he had the option of being other than just command 
and control, this is my opinion and I love it. 
 
 
Do you recall that we basically found a contradiction in him? He loves working 
with children, he wants to make sure that their minds are open in the whole 
love and understanding and so on, so that’s one pattern running in his mind. 
 
 
Yet on the other side, he wants to tell people his opinion and do 
indoctrinations, so the thing – education – that works best for opening minds 
is the thing he’s not doing at that point because he’s stuck in the pattern of 
indoctrination.

Do you see the conflict is already there? As soon as that conflict was pointed 
out to him, but in an intuitive manner – in other words how well does giving 
your opinion to children help them open their minds? That’s when he went 
wow it doesn’t, and that’s when everything realigned around the new 
paradigm that actually the choice that he was asking for. Do you see how that 
works? That’s the contradiction blowout in essence.  
 
 
Which of these six categories are you most likely to find that in?  
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
5. Inferences & Conclusions 
6. Implications & Consequences 
 
 
I think I just told you but you may as well guess. It’s five and six – inferences, 
conclusions, implications and consequences. The other place that it’s actually 
going to be fruitful hunting ground – because you need two positions for a 
contradiction – is number one, motivation and purpose.  
 
 
In Devin’s example, we contradicted his purpose, his motivation, with one of 
the conclusions he came to, which is it’s better to lead than to follow, and he 
had to contemplate the consequences in a way that conflicted with his 
purpose, so actually we used all three in what sounds like a very small 
maneuver but actually there was a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. 
 
 
Can you all follow what I mean by that? We’re going to practice this now. 
You’ll stand up, you’ll have about six minutes to try to work with at least three 
different people in that time, which means everyone gets about a minute.  
 
 
You do a minute and they do a minute. You meet someone else, you get a 
minute and they get a minute and so on. Speed and volume will be more 
important than smoothness and eloquence at this point. The smoothness and 
eloquence we’ll come back to at the end of the day, I promise you that. 
 
 
You’re going to go around and just check with them if there’s an aspiration 
that they want to improve on, or a problem that they’re stuck on or anything 
like that. It doesn’t matter.

Again, go through the three stages: 
 
 
 
RIP Formula 
1. Rapport 
2. Investigation 
3. Problem Destroyer 
 
Rapport, investigation and then throw in some zingy quick one-liner questions 
out there to get something juicy. 
 
 
See if you can find, especially within their purpose and their conclusions, if 
there’s a contradiction between them or between two sets of conclusions – 
whichever is easiest for you to arise.  
 
 
Do you understand the nature of the exercise? It is a tall order but I’ll make it 
a lot shorter by the end of the day, I promise you. We’re just looking for a 
contradiction in their thinking, and then expose them to that. It will make 
more sense as we carry on later on today. Right now I just want speed to 
really just get some things out there. Whether or not you get to it is 
irrelevant.  
 
 
Remember the brain scans that we talked about? This is one of those cases 
where just trying is enough. I do not need a result. All I want you to do is 
search for a result. Do you understand the distinction? This makes it a little bit 
shorter, although it’s still quite tall. Are there any questions on that? All right, 
stand up. Your six minutes start now. 
 
Finding Contradictions 
 
Igor: 
How did that go? I realize it’s a little bit on the tricky side to hunt for 
something in about a minute or so. I’m less interested in how well you 
succeeded because I know it was loaded against you in terms of the exercise.  
 
 
What I’m more interested – and this is the really important part – is how did 
you proceed to try to find a contradiction worth blowing out? Do you 
understand the question? What kind of things did you attempt to do? What 
kind of things were you looking for to try to find something worth blowing 
up?

Student: I asked about motivation and what he wanted to do once he got through his 
motivation, and then I assumed that he was making an assumption that it 
would get him that and went from there. I figured if my assumption was 
wrong, he would contradict me. 
 
Igor: 
And did he? 
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
Did it work? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Well done. 
 
Student: Sort of. 
 
Igor: 
Of course, to be fair in 60 seconds – I mean that’s a pretty sophisticated set of 
maneuvers to do in seconds, right? So, good job on that. I’m more interested 
in you guys starting to think strategically now more than anything else.  
 
Student: With the limited amount of time, I just fumbled through the first couple of 
questions and then when I heard an excuse, I expanded around that because 
eventually somebody’s going to contradict themselves when they start 
making excuses. 
 
Igor: 
Excuses are a wonderful source of contradictions worth exploiting. Beautiful. 
Thank you. 
 
Student: It’s probably also an expansion of the excuses where you have an either/or 
situation.  
 
Igor: 
How do you mean? 
 
Student: They say I’m doing this instead of that. I prefer to do this instead of that. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. In linguistics it’s called an exclusive or. It’s A or B. You may have 
noticed I did kind of miniature version of the contradiction blowout whenever 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
420 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you asked me do you have to do it this way or can you do it that way? What’s 
my answer usually? Yes. 
 
 
Can you see a miniaturized version of the contradiction blowout at that point? 
It’s not quite as powerful because I’m not linking it to something that’s 
personal to you. I’m not using something that you’re really married to, like the 
concept of opening children’s minds as leverage; however, you still feel it. 
Let’s say the first few times you’re not used to the idea, don’t you feel two 
ideas kind of collapsing together again? So, it’s a very mind bending moment 
for that. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: A similar theme with one of my partners. They thought they had to do regular 
exercise to get fit and I challenged him on why it has to be regular versus just 
the result. 
 
Igor: 
So, you’re challenging the idea of the assumption that it has to be regular to 
get a result and so on. Where did you actually find the contradiction? 
 
Student: The contradiction? It was not necessarily a contradiction. It was that they 
were adding something unnecessarily onto it.  
 
Igor: 
I agree with that. The maneuver is excellent and in terms of the contradiction 
– let’s put it this way. Any unexamined thought is very likely to have a set of 
contradictions because your unconscious mind is perfectly capable to run 
parallel streams that are totally contradictory and be happy with it and not 
even try to resolve it 
 
Student: Would you like me to mind read into what the contradiction that I found was? 
 
Igor: 
Sure, that would be very useful and I’ll explain why in a moment. Go on. 
 
Student: They could be regularly going to the gym but never getting into the pool. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Now what you have is a strategy in terms of how can I ask questions 
to get them to the point to realize that just going to the gym regularly won’t 
necessarily be enough or that exercising irregularly might actually not work 
better than not doing it at all? So, your thinking is exactly down the right lines. 
Rather than being psychologically leading, I’ll do a quick version of this if I may 
just to expand on your thought. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
421 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It will be something along the lines of do you want to exercise? Yes. And you 
think that by exercising regularly you’ll get healthy, you’ll get fit? Yes. That’s a 
reasonable assumption to make, right? And you’re finding it difficult to 
exercise regularly, so you’re not exercising at all. Is that right? Yes. There’s the 
contradiction. Do you hear it now? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you want me to spell it out or would you like to spell it out for me? 
 
Student: They have the assumption that if I can’t exercise regularly, then if I do 
anything it doesn’t count for anything. 
 
Igor: 
Right and to take it one step further, the premise is I have to regularly 
exercise to get fit, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I want to get fit but I can’t exercise regularly. Therefore, there’s no point 
doing anything at all. So, the contradiction and the way I’d spell it out to them 
once I’ve gone down that particular path – you want to exercise regularly to 
get fit, you don’t have the time for it, so you don’t do anything at all. So, let 
me ask you this. How fit are you getting doing nothing? Can you feel how it’s 
mind bending the way I presented that contradiction? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And you can see how that would blow out the idea that you have to exercise 
regularly just to get fit. Of course the truth is very likely that regular exercise is 
going to be a great solution to being fit. However, no exercise is a guarantee 
of staying unfit, as opposed to some exercise irregularly.  
 
 
At least what they do is they get a fighting chance to start exercising because 
there hasn’t been any particular time, and then they might develop a habit 
out of that because regular-ness comes from just doing it and if they don’t 
even start doing it because they don’t think they can do it regularly, it’s kind 
of back to this whole idea of planning.  
 
 
There’s too much to plan, so you may as well not do anything at all. Do you 
get the idea where the pattern comes from? So, you’re right on the money.

422 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
It’s just the more harshly you can contrast that contradiction, the more you 
get that zapped. Excellent. Good thinking. 
 
Student: Thank you for that. 
 
Igor: 
Or, as they like to say on my favorite TV program – good thinking, Batman. 
Norman, go ahead. 
 
Norman: I followed the approach of asking what’s stopping you or what’s preventing 
you to try and uncover a possible contradiction. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. That’s a wonderful source of contradictions. It’s not always the case 
but if they have a contradiction in terms of what they think is stopping them 
then you blow out the actual blockage.  
 
 
Let’s say it’s the exercising thing. If they think they can’t go exercising because 
they can’t get up early enough, maybe you can find a contradiction there in 
terms of exercise and sleep cycles and having a better night’s sleep after 
getting up earlier and so on. 
 
 
If you can get their mind thinking along the lines that exercising will help me 
get up earlier so I have more time to exercise, then it’s just a question of 
chicken and egg. That’s an excellent approach. 
 
 
Is this useful? These are things you’ve seen demonstrated. I just want you to 
now get strategic. You have a whole bunch of skills. You really do. You have 
the performance elements that make your skills comes to life, so the only 
thing that’s left to do is to get a little more strategic with what you’re doing, 
and that’s going to require a little bit of thinking and a little bit of puzzling 
things out. 
 
Student: I was wondering about the question that you gave just now. I did use the 
consequences and I wonder if that’s adequate. What are the consequences of 
not exercising as the blowout? That would be the same thing, right? 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. In fact, that’s exactly what I did. What is the consequence of 
thinking you have to exercise regularly to get fit? It’s that he’s not doing 
anything. What is the consequence of doing nothing? He stays unfit, which 
fundamentally clashes with his desire to be fit.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
423 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, you’re absolutely correct. The consequence is a great resource to find the 
contradiction in something. Think of it this way. It’s a little bit like that school 
teacher who did a contradiction blowout on the school children who thought 
they could do whatever they want as long as they’re honest about it. 
 
 
He then let them experience the consequences of being attached to that idea 
and it basically contradicted what they wanted as an experience, in other 
words, to be treated a particular way. He didn’t actually spell it out in that 
way but they were so angry about being treated in a particular way that it 
blew out the attachment to the idea that you can do whatever you want 
provided you’re honest.  
 
 
Do you see what I mean? So, it’s absolutely correct. Consequences are a 
phenomenal resource for finding contradictions.  
 
Student: If a person wants to do one thing and that’s his problem, and he’s happy to do 
that – actually I was working with a person and he likes to sleep in, in the 
mornings. I thought that’s fine. I’ve got the benefits of that and then I said, 
what are the advantages of getting going with your day? He said I could do a 
lot more and enjoy my life more if I had more time to do it in the day. I just 
exposed the contradiction in that way but I don’t think I did anything other 
than that.  
 
Igor: 
If I hear you correctly, there are two possibilities why that may or may not 
have worked so well. One is you hit them at the wrong layer of the layer cake. 
If it’s a very conscious thing, then all a contradiction does is it gets people 
defensive.  
 
 
Let’s take the exercise example. This goes back to the complex question 
example from earlier on. If I say do you realize that by thinking that you have 
to exercise regularly to get fit, you’re not doing any exercise at all, which 
makes you unfit and therefore you’re not getting as fit as you want. He says 
yes I realize that. That’s the whole problem. 
 
 
Do you see how that is basically just using the contradiction to increase 
frustration? It’s because the wrong mind is engaged. I need them to be 
thinking again so that they actually have thought processes going in their 
cycles. So, you want to exercise, right? Yes. But you can’t exercise regularly, 
right? Yes. But if you exercise regularly then you could – see how I’m guiding 
him towards it?

I’m looking for when do I have his mind in that yes space so that a 
contradiction can really hit them? Do you understand the distinction there? 
So, your approach is 100%. You just hit it at the wrong level. Does that help? 
 
Student: I worked with Dave sitting across from me and I really liked his problem a lot. 
When he goes to a restaurant, he cannot get his bacon cooked properly.  
 
Igor: 
You know that is a serious problem. 
 
Student: It is.  
 
Igor: 
I’m with you on this one. 
 
Student: I think we can all agree that it is a problem.  
 
Igor: 
It is. 
 
Student: When I looked at his face – I mean look at that smile. He likes that problem. 
He lights up. I thought we did the thing we were supposed to do. I asked him 
what choices he could make to get his bacon properly cooked and he was very 
creative about what he could do. The final thing was that he would carry a 
piece of properly cooked bacon in his pocket and show them. 
 
 
But then he said if I’ve got the bacon, why would I go out to get the bacon? 
So, we had to bring it back to being in the restaurant. Then he said we’re 
avoiding the issue here, the contradiction blowout.  
 
Igor: 
If I can just pause you for a second, what he just demonstrated was a 
competent example of a choice multiplier. You got exactly what you asked for, 
which is more choices, including a rather amusing one.  
 
Student: Yes, but then I felt like a complete failure, so I said oh my God I failed you. 
What can I do to make it up to you? I’ll cook you some bacon properly and he 
said, no you won’t, which to me was the key to this whole conversation. I 
think we’re dealing with the Holy Grail here. 
 
Igor: 
You actually haven’t failed at all. You just discovered possibly a very rich 
source of a contradiction. What is properly cooked bacon actually like? What 
does it mean? Is it crispy?

Student: Crispy, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is it a specific kind of bacon? Does it have to be crispy on both sides? What is 
it? How crispy does it have to be? Is it better if it’s crispy and blackened? So, 
get a whole sense of that. 
 
 
For example, if he thinks you can’t cook it properly knowing all that, then the 
contradiction might well be so is it just a question that you want your bacon 
to be properly crispy, or is it just that your bacon’s got to be better than 
anyone else’s? 
 
 
This is probably an amusing example. It hasn’t got much emotional energy in 
it, so you’re less likely to get anything of any deep metaphysical and 
unconscious responses. 
 
Student: Unless he gets a plate of badly cooked bacon. 
 
Igor: 
It depends on how much he cares about it, for real. If it’s just a joke – I’m 
watching the amusement on his face – it’s probably a minor peeve rather than 
anything else. If it was more of a serious thing, I’d actually want to get a 
genuine emotion out of him in terms of what’s it like to have badly cooked 
bacon? 
 
 
If he says it’s not very nice, that’s not good enough for me. I cannot get a 
strong enough conviction on the contradiction for something to blow out. 
Think of it this way, if I can give you an analogy. 
 
 
Let me put it this way to you. If you had a balloon that’s half blown up and 
you squashed it, what would happen? The air goes out of one end and goes to 
the other. It just expands, right? How full would the balloon have to be before 
you can pop it with a pinch?  
 
Student: Pretty full. 
 
Igor: 
Right. That’s why we call it a blowout.  
 
Student: So, I didn’t fill his balloon? 
 
Igor: 
I’m not sure I can answer that question.

Student: Just to be clear. 
 
Igor: 
To be perfectly frank… 
 
Student: Would you put it another way? 
 
Igor: 
I’m not sure that I’m qualified to answer that question.  
 
Student: The question is, is the onus on me? 
 
Igor: 
It depends. If you want an outcome, then of course the onus is on you to get 
him into a position where you can achieve the outcomes you want. What you 
did, you may think you had failed but you did not.  
 
 
You discovered the actual ingredient – to use a little pun on what we’re 
talking about right now – that will lead to a contradiction blowout. It’s just 
that you didn’t have time to pursue it.  
 
 
Now that you’ve had time to think about it, were you to go back to that 
conversation or have another similar one, you’d have a much better instinct 
about oh I get it, this person is kind of serious about it but not quite enough, 
so I’ll have to actually get him to commit to something. 
 
 
Once he’s committed, it’s the commitment that’s fragile and it can broken. I’ll 
give you an example of this. When I was a young man – I’m so old now – I 
used to enjoy a good argument with the best of them.  
 
 
As is the want of the younger generations, I was a bit of an activist in the 
things that I thought were right. This is it. This is how I’ve got to be. Freedom 
is so important that I’m going to shove it down your throat.  
 
 
I remember I was at a friend’s birthday party and there were a whole bunch of 
boys and girls my age there. The birthday girl’s father, who was of course 
supervising the whole thing – I can’t even remember what the topic was. I 
was just discussing some stuff with the other guys at the table and 
pontificating. 
 
 
This is why I really respect Devin because he’s right. This is how it is! I had my 
wonderful eloquent argument as being espoused and so on, and he comes in 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
427 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
with his little mischievous grin and says what about this? I said no because of 
this and argued my point. He said no it’s more about this. He kept going on 
and on. Every time I thought I’d nailed him and put the last nail in the coffin, 
he’s slither out like an eel and come up with another point. I was getting so 
frustrated with him that I honestly considered turning to violence.  
 
Student: And you have the training. 
 
Igor: 
But then here’s the big lesson. At some point in this whole interaction I 
realized he does not give a damn one way or another about any of this. That’s 
why he’s totally free to change his position at any point. He’s messing with 
me.  
 
Student: Yes, I got that. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so basically his balloon was only half full.  
 
Student: Where’s the pity? 
 
Igor: 
Well, if bacon is important enough to him. So, really that’s all it is. You need a 
commitment, especially with the contradiction blowout, but actually with 
most things. If they don’t really care, there’s nothing you can do. That’s why 
doing Mind Bending Language as a role play demo is very difficult because 
people don’t actually have any unconscious commitment to something, so 
they can just slither around forever and cycle around at the same level. 
There’s nothing that will drop them down into the next layer.  
 
 
With real people with actual genuine stuck-ness on something, as soon as you 
hit the stuck thing you’re instantly down to the next level provided you know 
how to handle it without causing any defense mechanism.  
 
 
So, you didn’t actually fail. You actually got right where you wanted to be. It’s 
just that you had a partner that was just amusing yourself more. Hence, you 
didn’t have the psychological energy you needed for the blowout to actually 
occur. 
 
Student: Okay, thanks. 
 
Igor: 
Was this useful? Are there any other comments or questions?  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
428 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Just a question. I just want to make sure. You made a comment to John about 
what he did was correct but it’s not at the right level. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just add a little bit to that. I said what most likely happened is that. I 
wasn’t there. I didn’t see the interaction, so I cannot say that for sure but 
having done enough of this, that is my best guess at what is likely to happen. 
 
Student: I’d like to describe to you what my partner and I did. It was more or less 
similar to that. Basically the thing that she wanted to improve upon was she 
said that while there are interactions going on with another person, she 
wanted to serve herself as well.  
 
 
So, I looked at her and said what about the notion that you should just let go 
and make sure you pay attention to the person. So, that was the contrast that 
I thought I was finding. 
 
Igor: 
Let me pause you here. When you mentioned that, what were you trying to 
achieve? Were you trying to achieve the contradiction? 
 
Student: That’s right. I was trying to achieve a contradiction. 
 
Igor: 
Again let me pause you. This is an important part. Were you psychologically 
leading at that point or intuitively leading with your question? 
 
Student: I was logically leading. 
 
Igor: 
I would disagree with you on that one. You were psychologically leading 
because you’re just giving advice. I want to observe myself whilst talking to 
other people. Do you know the purpose? Do you know what she’s trying to 
achieve with it? Do you know what’s going to happen with it?  
 
 
If you just say look at it another way, you’re going straight for a reframe 
without actually having shifted consciousness yet. You’re staying at the same 
level. It’s the equivalent of giving advice. There’s nothing wrong with the idea.  
 
 
The instinct you have about that idea is actually a very good one and the 
chance of you getting a contradiction that you’ll blow out on is very high, but 
what you didn’t do is lead her there. Would you like to have a quick example 
of the kind of thing I mean? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
429 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
I’ll just run both sides of the role play just to give you a quick example. What’s 
the purpose of observing yourself whilst having an interaction? Oh, it’s to 
have a better quality of interaction so that I can talk to people better. 
Excellent. So, trying to pay attention to yourself and doing it at the same time, 
how much is that helping you do that? Well, it’s not. That’s the problem. 
 
 
So, aside from that problem, what are the things you’re not doing in the 
interaction that would actually improve it? What do you mean? Think of it this 
way. To the extent you’re trying to do too much at one time, well you’ll get 
what you’ve got. So, what can you do that’s less than that to give you more? 
 
 
So, you’re really implying the answer of being in the moment or whatever it 
is. I’m not saying that necessarily will be the end all be all. I need genuine 
reactions to be able to give you the right path to lead along. It’s more to 
demonstrate that your idea was correct. It was, as you actually intuited 
already, premature because you just dived into it. 
 
 
This is one of the biggest problems. We’re getting into a very important point 
here. In Mind Bending Language in particular, but in persuasion in general, I 
think one of the biggest problems I’ve seen with people is we’re in a rush.  
 
 
Of course in this exercise I specifically created that rush for you, but I did warn 
you that I didn’t need a result. I just needed the attempt at a result to get 
your thinking going.  
 
 
Some of you interpreted that as needing to get a result, which is fine, but just 
realize that you created that problem for yourself. If you want to make it hard 
on yourself, by all means do so. Your instincts were perfect. Just consider this.  
 
 
If you were to have that interaction again with a little bit more time, how 
would you question your partner to get them to the point where they would 
themselves discover the contradiction that you already witnessed and try to 
tell them outright? 
 
Student: I’d ask questions on why she wants to. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
430 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
That could be one way of doing it. It could be about conclusions, like what do 
you think witnessing and interacting would do? That’s kind of looking at the 
assumptions and conclusions, right?  
 
 
You might go down the route of what happens when people try to do too 
much at the same time – a multitasking thing? That would be an example of 
implications and consequences. What are the consequences of trying to be 
there and not at the same time? 
 
 
Then a blowout is once she’s here going like you know what, I’m really trying 
to hold onto this but it’s starting to shift around a little bit. Now the door is 
opening a bit. Then you can present it in a mind bending way.  
 
 
So, just consider the possibility that you’ll only be able to observe yourself and 
interact with people at the same time and do it eloquently to the extent you 
stop trying to. Did you hear the contradiction blowout there? That’s a really 
common one. 
 
 
Actually I’ll give you the rationale behind that one. Who knows what I mean 
by the Law of Reverse Effect? Excellent. For those of you who do not, the Law 
of Reverse Effect is basically this – when the conscious mind attempts to do a 
task that is actually designed for the unconscious mind to complete, it will fail 
miserably because it will just interfere with an actual process. 
 
 
I learned this at school. I was put on the football team – some of you would 
call it soccer. In Europe we have the right name. It’s called football. Being new 
to the sport, I was put in the most hated position – goal – because nothing 
ever happens here, except for when it really does. 
 
 
Something curious happened. At one point in the match, there was this little 
squirt of boy who would just race all over the place. He’d kick the ball and he 
was going a million miles an hour.  
 
 
Everyone’s face fell because he was going way too fast for him to stop, and 
without a thought, without thinking, my knees collapsed and trapped the ball 
and everyone thought I was superhero – me included. 
 
 
Then something very interesting happened. A few minutes later they play it 
again. Someone kicked the ball and there was no one between them and the 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
431 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
ball, but they were just miles off, so it was just kind of bouncing on the ground 
at a lazy pace. 
 
 
Really the other kids thought oh Igor will get that. That’s easy. They didn’t 
even bother running. Why bother running after that ball. It’s just a long pitch, 
right? And we’ve only got short stumpy legs. We were very young at the time. 
 
 
I’m sitting there thinking I’m going to get the ball, I’m going to get the ball, I’m 
going to get the ball. Oh God, no. Do you understand the law of reverse 
effect?  
 
 
That’s when the contradiction blowout really works nicely, and if you want a 
canned language pattern – and you understand the absolute dangers of 
thinking that’s a canned pattern and something you just throw out there 
whenever, but it’s something you’ll hear me say relatively frequently when I 
identify this, but only at the right point when I have that sweet spot open – I’ll 
throw something out along the lines of I hope you realize that you’ll get what 
you want but only to the extent you stop trying. 
 
 
That sounds more conscious. In this case I’ll say just consider the possibility 
that you’ll be able to witness your interactions and improve them but only to 
the extent that you don’t even do it anymore.  
 
 
Can you feel the spin in there? The language pattern itself is not that 
important. It’s more the psychology that allowed me to create it. That’s what 
I’m really interested in – the strategy behind it. Do you understand that? Is 
that 
useful? 
Are 
there 
any 
follow-up 
questions 
or 
comments? 
 
Student: So, is that the standard procedure for the contradiction blowout, what you 
just gave us there? 
 
Igor: 
There’s a great danger to perceive that any standard procedure exists.  
 
Student: Well, it was fairly easy to understand the choice multiplier. That seemed very 
straightforward. 
 
Igor: 
The standard procedure for a contradiction blowout is essentially to find a 
contradiction in what they hold to be true and expose them to that. Did I use 
that whole thing to an extent, this and the other with Devin? No.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
432 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Would you like me to give you the simplest formulation of the contradiction 
blowout that still encapsulates that for you? It’s totally conversational. You’ve 
probably heard it 100 times in the last year alone, and it only works when 
you’ve got the timing right – in other words you’ve had someone drop down 
the layer cake sufficiently for this.  
 
 
It’s the classic looking at someone with a known look and saying how is that 
working out for you? Can you hear the implication? Well, I want to be loved 
and they don’t love me, so I just lash out at them. They’ve already set the 
contradiction up for you. 
 
 
It’s more difficult to do it this way, which is why I don’t, but I’ve seen people 
do it very efficiently or effectively. You literally just turn around and say how’s 
that working out for you? If you do it with the right timing, you’ll get 
fireworks. If you do it at the wrong time, they’ll say it doesn’t, that’s why I’m 
here! That’s the risk that you run. 
 
 
So, there’s no standard pattern for it. Just understand the nature of what the 
contradiction blowout is. Does that kind of clarify it a little bit for you?  
 
Student: I guess it clarifies it as best it can be clarified. It seems like it’s not an easy 
thing to clarify. 
 
Igor: 
Yes because it’s not something you can pin down. It’s a beast that changes 
shape according to circumstances. The more important idea for us here is 
when you’ve just spotted a contradiction and you can drop someone down 
that layer cake enough so they’re thinking more in the unconscious realm, 
and then exposing them to the contradiction with the implication that it no 
longer is necessary, that’s where things change.  
 
 
You saw it with Amir pretending to be a client. You saw it with Devin and his 
communication style. You heard about it with the teacher and the school kids. 
Each one had a different language approach to it just because the situation 
was different.  
 
 
The main thing to remember is if they’re too conscious, it’s too glib and the 
contradiction will not work. It will just annoy the hell out of them, and if you 
get them to the right point where they’re really thinking again and then point 
the contradiction out, that’s when they have the freedom to start resolving it.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
433 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
That’s all we’re trying to get at, whether it’s through a clever language pattern 
or not. Does that help a little bit more? 
 
Student: Yes. What I saw happening with Devin was almost like parts therapy.  
 
Igor: 
Yes, yes, yes.  
 
Student: He had one part that had a certain role and personality – the father figure, 
tough love – and a second part that wanted to nurture.  
 
Igor: 
If it helps you to think of it in that way, every contradiction has to be a parts 
integration.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Because it’s two conflicting parts doing two different things.  
 
Student: Yes and what I saw you do at that point was you in essence sort of chunked 
up and found some higher motivation, which was the most important value to 
Devin at that point. 
 
Igor: 
If it helps you to think of it in those terms, then by all means do so. That might 
be an easier way for you to consider it. Just realize there may be other 
nuances that fall outside of that particular model, and you don’t need to ever 
get to them if this is enough for you to be very successful. 
 
Student: Okay. I’m trying to see that within a context of Mind Bending Language. 
 
Igor: 
Well, you just saw it. 
 
Student: What are the Mind Bending Language patterns – because I can see the mind 
bending patterns that work with the choice multiplier? 
 
Igor: 
These problem destroyers are not linked to the language, although the 
language can express them. They’re actually mind bending moments. With 
Devin I didn’t use any particular language. It was just something along the 
lines of you want the kids’ minds to be open. How much are you going to 
open their minds when you’re telling them your opinion? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
434 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
That’s just the contradiction. Is there a huge language pattern there? Not 
really. A little bit. That’s the point. It’s supposed to feel really natural, exactly. 
 
Student: You were still taking him outside his realm of normal possibilities.  
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. It’s just the language was not it.  
 
Student: Right.  
 
Igor: 
So, what I’m suggesting is, don’t get hung up on the language. Focus on what 
is the experience of it? What is the mind bending moment? The mind bending 
moment is two contradictory positions have to be contemplated at a 
particular level at the same time, and then they collapse. They integrate and 
that’s when a better thing emerges. 
 
 
If the integration example is one that really works for you, by all means think 
of it that way.  
 
Student: Got it. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Is this useful stuff? Are there any other questions? 
 
Student: I’m hearing kind of a little contradiction myself here. I got quite clear with the 
understanding that the contradiction has to be exposed to the mind of the 
client, but over there I’m just hearing another story, that you have to discover 
that first and then let them know about that. 
 
Igor: 
First of all, all that matters is that at the right level of mind the client is 
exposed to that contradiction with the implication for an integration. 
Whether you do it by accident or on purpose is irrelevant. It just is a lot easier 
if you have an instinct that that’s going to happen so that you can maneuver it 
towards that. 
 
 
With Devin for example, I was pretty sure – especially once I got the kids, I 
knew it was there. It took me about two or three questions to follow up to get 
him to recognize the contradiction, but as soon as I heard it I knew it was 
there because logically I could see the consequences of it all. So, it definitely 
helps but it doesn’t have to be.

We’ll save the next exercise for tomorrow. What I want to do now is give you 
an integration piece. In other words, I want you to find a partner. Whether 
you’ve worked with them or not before is irrelevant. I want you to go back to 
having a 10-minute chat with them. They get 10 minutes and you get 10 
minutes, 20 minutes in total. 
 
 
They’re going to bring up a particular problem or aspiration, something, 
please, that has some genuineness to it. All you’re going to do is go right back 
to what you did this morning.  
 
 
Just ask the six questions, just probe around and whatever you do, and in the 
back of your mind just wonder and consider whether more choice would be 
appropriate here or whether you can hear some kind of contradiction going 
on, in which case you can try to expose that.  
 
 
But that is something that will emerge. You’re not necessarily looking for it. 
You’re actually only focusing on your probing questions, and if you happen to 
dig up some kind of limitations where more choices will be useful, or you 
happen to discover something that sounds like a bit like a contradiction might 
exist here, then explore that further. Does that make sense to you? Easy to 
do? Off you go. 
 
Exercise Debrief 
 
Igor: 
All right, how was that as an experience? What did you get from it? First of all, 
wasn’t that a lot easier than the first couple of runs around it? How many of 
you got closer to choice multipliers and contradiction blowouts now that you 
actually had some significant time to play with this? Put your hands up. Is 
there anything you want to say about the experience right now? Okay, you’re 
a very garrulous lot today. 
 
Student: I just realized that when you’re in your own life and so close to it, you can’t 
see the contradictions. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: And the person looking at it, it seems like it’s obvious. 
 
Igor: 
Yes.

Student: So, if you’re too close to it, like your life, you’re blind to it.  
 
Igor: 
Yes and the key here is you don’t want to confront people with the 
contradiction directly because that would be violating your 10 keys of 
something or other. That’s a technical term. What else did you guys discover? 
I agree with that. Go ahead, Jules. 
 
Jules: 
What seemed like a conversation that was falling away from the exercise, I 
think we both gave each other considerable extra options and the solutions 
started filling in because the conversation had a little more time. 
 
Igor: 
Right, exactly. 
 
Jules: 
So, even though it felt like we were failing, I think we accomplished more than 
either of us would have assumed we were getting to. 
 
Igor: 
Consider a couple of things here. Number one, how much easier did it 
become when you went from one minute to 10 minutes? How much more 
influential? Ten minutes is really not that long.  
 
 
Remember, you just came off the highway or the freeway, and you’ve gone 
into normal regular traffic again and it’s like oh I’ve got plenty of time now. 
These problem destroyers are just two of multiple choices. There are many 
different choices. There are many different things that are possible. 
 
 
The ones we’ll be discussing tomorrow to add to this list – and these of course 
included as well – these are things that I’ve done and I’ve spotted myself 
routinely doing. I’m sure I do other things that I’m not aware of yet, and rest 
assured as soon as I know about them, so will you. 
 
 
What excites me more though is the very high likelihood that you guys will 
come up with problem destroyers that I’m unaware of, and I sincerely hope 
you’ll show me too because that’s how we grow in a particular field.  
 
 
 
 
You’ll notice that once the pressure was off, wasn’t it easier to go back to a 
normal conversational style and go back to the probing questions? Recall 
earlier today, the probing questions on their own can be very influential or 
therapeutic, depending on which path you need to be taking with people.

We’re just specifically hunting a specific style to give you an experience of it 
but it’s artificial. You don’t hunt for these things. They come and jump in your 
face and say look here I am!  
 
 
This is an important part of the learning process, especially if you want to 
master these things in Mind Bending Language, which I presume you do. Note 
I’m presuming, not assuming. You are now sensitive to a specific kind of shall 
we say mental condition. You can spot when someone’s too narrow in their 
choices. It will jump out at you because you’ve been looking at how to expand 
those choices.  
 
 
It’s easier for you to spot contradictions in everyday life in people’s thinking 
and behavior, in their feelings and so on because you’ve gone looking for the 
contradiction blowout. The actual method of blowout is actually almost 
ridiculously easy.  
 
 
The difficult part – which is I think where some of you may have struggled a 
little bit – is finding the contradiction in the first place to blow out, or finding 
the narrowed set of choices to multiply, but that’s an artificial thing. That’s 
not how it actually works in real life, is it? 
 
 
If you go back to having a regular conversation with no particular aim other 
than to probe, those probes will tell you which of these if any you will use. 
There will be other problem destroyers, and sometimes you don’t use any of 
these problem destroyers. Just the mere fact that you’re probing with 
questions is mind bending on its own. 
 
 
I’m just trying to give you some more range in terms of choices so that you 
spot patterns that are very common, or at least in my experience are very 
common, in how people get stuck. Contradictions are one way to get stuck. 
Narrowing your choices down is another way to get stuck.  
 
 
There another way to get stuck, but for that you’ll have to come back 
tomorrow. Who’s learned something of value today? Who’s glad today is 
over, like you’ve worked something? Who thinks they deserve a well-earned

Well, in that case let’s do another exercise. No, I’m like that teacher. I’m 
fooling with you now. I think you’ve done a very good job, so tonight the best 
thing you can do is just relax, enjoy yourselves, have nice and deep

DVD 14 – Destroying Even Bigger Problems 
With Emotional Reframes & Outframes 
 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
How are you doing? Is everyone good? I see some holes in the ranks. Either 
I’ve broken a lot of people or they’re taking it easy this morning. I’m not sure 
which it is. Maybe it’s both. 
 
 
I want to start off very quickly with a brief Q&A session. Do you all understand 
overall what the two problem destroyers look like and what to do with them 
when you get to them?  
 
 
It’s a little bit artificial going looking for them. It’s more a question of 
something happens, you find them and then that’s when you say oh I’ve got 
something to do with this. That’s really how you use these things.  
 
 
It’s useful going looking for them just for the experience of that, and the point 
when they become really valuable is when you are just confronted with them 
and your mind recognizes it and you say oh, I’ve been looking for you all this 
time and here you are. 
 
Student: Would you just write down again the specific points you look for when you do 
the contradiction blowout? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. All I’m looking for is I need some kind of leverage. They’ve got to be 
attached to something important. I want something that they’re more 
attached to than the problem.  
 
 
Just to use Devin’s example again because it’s an easy example to use, in 
Devin’s example you could all see he was clearly attached to the idea of 
helping children, being a big brother to a young child and coaching that child, 
opening his mind up and so on.

You could see there was a lot of emotion there, right? I’m looking for an idea 
that they’re really attached to that’s going to have more leverage, so when I 
contrast that to a conflicting idea – I like telling people what to do – it creates 
an intuitive leap. I’m leading intuitively at this point.  
 
 
Then he says oh, I have these two things. This is kind of the reasoning process. 
He says I have these two things. I think this one’s really important. I kind of 
used to like this one a lot as well but they clash, so this one then just 
dissolves. It blows out because of it. That’s really the essence of it.  
 
 
Sometimes you don’t necessarily have to have a lot of emotion in it. 
Sometimes rather than having an intuitive leap, a logical leap can be just as 
good. The only danger with a logical leap is they may have thought of it 
already. If you’re going to present it, you’re going to present the conflict and 
you need two key ingredients to present the conflict. 
 
1. You know that layer cake we talked about? They’ve got to be deep in 
that layer cake than they normally are, so their normal thought 
processes are already interrupted.  
 
 
That way they don’t go back to the things they already know. You know how 
to do that now, right? You’ve been doing it for three or four days already. So, 
this is not something you jump into. This is something you do after running 
through a few probing questions to see which level of that layer cake you can 
get them to. You need to do it at a different level of the layer cake.  
 
2. Especially if I have a reason to believe that they’ve already thought of 
that conflict – because maybe they present it as a conflict – I’ll present 
that conflict again but this time with more Mind Bending Language 
around it to carry more of a spin with the idea as well. 
 
 
Those are really the two main ways I can currently think of that I use the 
contradiction blowout. Does that help? Was that useful? Thank you.  
 
Student: Thank you. Yesterday I was working on some legal papers, including a 
pleading, and I noticed that some of the Mind Bending Language just 
happened to slip in.  
 
Igor: 
Oh, terrible.

Student: I asked myself the question does this work in writing or do you need the 
nonverbal cues with the keys and things like that? 
 
Igor: 
A lot of people ask this. Let me guide you through the layers. What do you 
think might be the danger of using too much Mind Bending Language in a 
written form? 
 
Student: If it’s noticeable, it’s not very good. 
 
Igor: 
Why? What do you think might happen? 
 
Student: Because people will feel influenced and notice that you’re doing it. 
 
Igor: 
Or actually the more likely thing that’s going to happen is it doesn’t make any 
sense. They’ll think you’re nuts. This person can’t even write properly. Throw 
the pleadings out. That’s the first issue you have to overcome. 
 
 
The second issue, specifically with the idea of Mind Bending Language and 
mind bending moments, is it’s difficult to judge the timing because it’s all 
about timing, isn’t it?  
 
 
Remember we were talking about the layer cake and so on. It can be done 
and I’ve seen it done in good sales copy, but then people have to take a 
meticulous approach to really slowly writing other things along the way to 
guide them down a particular path to make it more likely than not that they’ll 
be in the right place, and even then it’s still a percentage game, so it’s not a 
guarantee. 
 
 
That’s the main issue with doing it in writing. It’s a lot easier in person 
because you can see are you there or not? Plus remember the key to Mind 
Bending Language isn’t the language that you create.  
 
 
It’s actually using what they say as your launch pad for the next level, and 
that’s very difficult to do in a pre-written context. So, yes it’s useful to pepper 
them in like seasoning but, like salt, if you put too much on it, then it won’t 
taste very good anymore.  
 
Student: Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome.

Student: I’ve got a question but there’s something I want to share first. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. Thank you. 
 
Student: I have a teenage 17-year old son and as with many teenagers you get the ‘I 
don’t know’ answers and hardly talk to him. So, he’s into basketball and he’s 
got this idea that – he says basketball is for tall and big people, but he wants 
to go to the NBA. He’s only 5’ 11” or something like that. So, we almost had a 
fight when he started this idea and saying if you believe that, then don’t play 
anymore.   
 
 
That was a couple of weeks ago. Last night when we came to the dinner table, 
he said I need to be big, I need to be big. I need to eat this and where’s the 
meat? I just heard myself saying what does it do for you to be big? He said I 
know in the university just doing shooting, I can’t layup because I can’t really 
push them aside because I’m too small.  
 
 
Then I said – and this was just coming out – I said fine I agree with being big 
and being able to push people aside, but what are things you haven’t 
considered to allow you to do layups while waiting for yourself to be big? 
 
Igor: 
Give him a round of applause. You can hear the choice multiplier, can’t you? 
Go ahead. 
 
Student: It was so funny because I wasn’t even trying. It was just coming out. I 
expected him not to respond in his normal way and say come on dad you 
don’t understand or something like that, but he responded. He said well by 
being faster. I said oh. As soon as he said that, immediately, I thought there 
was something accomplished. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. 
 
Student: So, I kind of froze. 
 
Igor: 
That is superb. If I can just pause you here because that was a phenomenal 
thing you did. Did you hear the choice multiplier just being totally natural at 
this point?

He could have done a contradiction blowout too, but actually the path that 
was open to you, the one that you took was the choice multiplier. It doesn’t 
matter which way you go. We’re just giving you some maneuvers to have 
some bite point. 
 
 
Notice that it wasn’t just the choice multiplier. The key bit was when he came 
back and said I can be faster, so it’s the opening and closing of the mind that’s 
important here.  
 
 
I’m going to take a stab in the dark here, but would it be fair to say that your 
son at that point looked more animated or thoughtful and motivated with this 
idea of being faster? 
 
Student: That’s right. He certainly was talking. 
 
Igor: 
This goes back to the whole status things. One of the reasons teenagers are 
more unresponsive is because part of their developmental cycle is they’ve got 
to separate themselves from the parental unit to be their own individual. So, 
whatever you say has to be wrong because otherwise how can they be 
different from you?  
 
 
This is where the Columbo approach is great. You want to be faster? Yes, I 
never even thought of that. You’re a smart kid. I would have said that there’s 
no way you can get to the NBA, but unless I’ve misunderstood you are you 
telling me that just by getting faster you have a shot? 
 
Student: Right. I think I got so excited that it had an effect. 
 
Igor: 
It doesn’t matter. The point is you did a great thing, and I’m just giving you 
some more food for thought. I mean what you did was eloquent, think about 
it. To get a teenager who is already trained to be unresponsive and somewhat 
sullen to open up like that in seconds – that’s where the magic’s at. Well 
done. 
 
Student: I wasn’t conscious of it but I was getting conscious after I said it. When I said 
what does it do for you, then I became aware that I said it.  
 
Igor: 
And that’s exactly how it’s supposed to work, isn’t it? If you’re sitting there 
thinking about it the whole time, how on Earth is it going to work? Those of 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
444 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you who have come across Mind Bending Language before and you struggled 
with the cards or one procedure or another, there’s nothing wrong with that.  
 
 
I think it’s an important foundation to polish what you do. I honestly believe 
that, but if you get stuck at that mechanical level, it’s always going to be 
clunky and clumsy. That’s probably why it felt clunky and clumsy before. What 
you’re doing now, on the other hand, this is it. Good job. Did you have a 
follow-up question as well? 
 
Student: Yes but before that – when I got to that point, I stopped and I turned to my 
wife who teaches at Montessori, kids four years old. She’s always had a 
problem getting the attention of the kids and keeping them quiet.  
 
 
So, I told her I’ve got a new technique for you. It’s a new word – shhh. So, I 
took the opportunity to kind of stop. I thought I already had some success and 
then kind of just put it in another conversation.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Just enjoy it. I mean when these moments come, you get to be real 
proud of yourself, and this is just one of many experiences to come. That 
wasn’t a choice multiplier, was it? 
 
Student: No, it wasn’t. I guess my question is kind of contradictory to that. I’m still 
trying to get my head around the contradiction blowout. When you find it, 
what do you do with it? That’s basically my question. 
 
Igor: 
Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about that question? Take your 
son, for example. You’re saying that he wants to go the NBA on the one hand 
but he thinks he’s too short, so he can’t do some important skills that will get 
him there, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
 You can clearly hear there’s a contradiction there and that’s going to be very 
frustrating to him, right? 
 
Student: He’s complaining why he’s short. 
 
Igor: 
Right, it’s like dad it’s your fault. Why couldn’t you have been taller? You gave 
me some dirty genes. The contradiction to exploit in this case – this is the 
path that I would be interested in going down – is clearly there’s a lot of 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
445 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
passion and drive to get to the NBA, which as a parent you may well want to 
support. 
 
Student: Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
Do you think there’s more passion in his desire to be tall or in his desire to get 
to the NBA? 
 
Student: I’m not sure. Sorry, do I think there’s more passion... 
 
Igor: 
By the way, you’re doing it right now. Is there more passion in his desire to go 
to the NBA or in his desire to get taller? 
 
Student: The desire to go to the NBA. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So, there’s a contradiction but the positive side of the contradiction – 
getting to the NBA – has more passion, more energy, more enthusiasm, more 
motivation in it shall we say. 
 
 
So, if you can get him to the mindset you were in a second ago just by talking 
about it – you can say this is interesting. This is not something you necessarily 
just throw out straightaway. You talk a little bit about what is it you’ve got to 
bring to the NBA and what have you got here and so on? How have you tried 
to get taller and how much is that working?  
 
 
How much energy have you invested in the NBA? So, I’m really curious would 
you rather go to the NBA or would you rather get taller? He’ll say of course I’d 
prefer to go to the NBA. I’ve just created a contrast of the contradiction, 
right? So, this is why I’m really curious now because I wonder what would 
happen if you put all the energy and enthusiasm you’ve been showing about 
trying to get taller into actually becoming better, so you can actually deserve a 
place in the NBA. 
 
 
Do you see where there’s a strong contrast? We’re taking the energy out of 
the obsession with height, which there is a genetic limitation. I’m sure he can 
eat the right things and that will help a great deal, but there is a genetic 
limitation within that. 
 
 
So, if he takes the passion out of that and into things like getting faster for 
example, that’s where the biggest transformation will happen for him, but he 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
446 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
doesn’t see it right now. You can’t explain it to him logically because your 
logic will be blocked by some emotional defense mechanism because he’s 
already married to the idea of getting taller.  
 
 
By doing it in the way we just described – which is you get him to really think 
about would you rather play in the NBA or would you rather be tall and watch 
it? There’s a nice little contrast there. It shocks his mind a bit.  
 
 
The amygdala triggers, his old thought patterns get interrupted and he’ll go 
huh? Well, think about it. You’ve put all this effort into getting taller. What 
would happen if you put that effort into actually getting better? Is it about 
getting taller or is it about getting better? What do you think he’s going to 
say? 
 
Student: He’s going to say that the latter is better. 
 
Igor: 
It’s about getting better, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, one way of getting better might be getting taller. What are more? That’s 
essentially what you did. You just did the choice multiplier without necessarily 
putting as much pressure on the contradiction blowout, so he’ll probably still 
have energy in terms of wanting to get taller because that idea hasn’t been 
contradicted yet.  
 
 
It hasn’t been blown out yet. He just has other ways of doing it on top of 
being taller, but now that he has that you can create a contrast there. Which 
do you think you can improve more – getting faster or getting taller? Can you 
feel it happening again – the contradiction? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
When those contradictions clash, one of them is going to go, and the way I’ve 
set it up is logically leading. Given the universe we live in, which one do you 
have more influence over – getting taller or getting faster? Faster. There’s a 
lot more room to maneuver shall we say in terms of increasing speed as a 
human being than increasing height. Do you understand the contradiction 
blowout a bit better now?

Student: I do, yes. Now I do. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. 
 
Student: Thank you very much. 
 
Collin: 
I had dinner last night with my nephew and his family and of course what’s 
the obvious question? What are you learning on the course? 
 
Igor: 
A dangerous question. 
 
Collin: 
So, I said I couldn’t even attempt to tell you but I will show you. So, I started 
with them. They’ve got a son who’s about five or six. He’ll listen for a little 
while and then he went back to his toys. Later in the evening I was talking 
with him and he said I’m looking forward to going back to school tomorrow. 
 
 
Of course I said oh, you like school. Well, no but when I say to my teacher 
who are you that’s… and he had it all. I thought he was playing with his toys. I 
mean it took me three days to learn that. It was magic. 
 
Igor: 
And the little gleam in the eye that he had when he said that, that’s how you 
do Mind Bending Language, right? That’s beautiful. Thank you, Collin. Go 
ahead. 
 
Student: I have a comment more than anything. If you really want to see Mind Bending 
Language in process, listen to the media. This morning as I was getting ready, I 
was listening to the radio and this car dealership commercial comes on, and 
they say something like bring your old vehicle in and we will recycle it, and 
you’re thinking wow that’s great. 
 
 
And we’ll even give you $3,000 in our cash-for-clunkers program. I’m making 
the pictures in my head and I’m noticing and picturing going to the scrap yard 
and you’re getting $3,000 and aren’t they so great, they’re supporting cash-
for-clunkers, and then they say for your 2006 vehicle. 
 
 
All of the sudden the breaks went on in my head and I’m like wait a second, 
when is it that a 2006 vehicle – a six-year-old vehicle – is a piece of junk that 
needs to be recycled? I don’t think the average person would have caught 
onto that.

Igor: 
No.  
 
Student: Which is really interesting. 
 
Igor: 
That is an example of the objection destroyer. That’s actually been researched 
and one of the problem destroyers we’ll come onto later today is what I call 
the objection destroyer, which is exactly that pattern.  
 
 
The version they’re using there is somewhat more unethical I think. I’ll show 
you how to use it but of course the ethics is what you have to bring in 
yourself. Okay, just a couple more questions and then we really have to get 
onto actually doing some stuff here. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I’m just curious. You said earlier if you become faster you’ll have a shot. The 
scope of ambiguity in that – a shot at the hoop and a shot at the NBA – did 
you do that intentionally? 
 
Igor: 
Yes and no.  
 
Student: Because John Overdurf loves that opportunity. When that thing is teed up for 
you or laid up for you, you go for it. Knowing how sneaky you are at times, I’m 
just wondering if you sort for opportunities like that or if they just come to 
you that way. 
 
Igor: 
If you’re asking my conscious mind, I’m totally clueless. I am a brain dead 
moron. That’s why I can do it so well, because I don’t get in my own way. Do I 
see opportunities? Yes. But the train of thought is something like they say 
something, I start replying and halfway through my reply I realize what I’m 
about to say and how clever it is. There’s no thought involved in that in a 
traditional sense.  
 
Student: This is just a question for the basketball guy. Should you use examples? Why 
I’m thinking of that is to throw in there somewhere Steve Nash. He’s younger, 
he’s in better shape, but he’s the same height as I am and he’s won several 
MVP’s. So, would you use that? 
 
Igor: 
Examples can work great. The example itself is a great idea. The trick is at 
what level of the mind are you presenting the example? If you’re at the level 
of the mind where he’s obsessively running through the loop – I’ve got to get 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
449 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
taller, I’ve got to get taller, I’ve got to get taller – there’s an automatic reject 
of any idea that contradicts I have to get taller.  
 
 
If you can trigger the amygdala, if you can drop him down a few levels in 
terms of his thinking so he’s like what’s going on and getting a little bit 
confused or really thinking about it or struggling with the concept or doubting 
himself a little bit, and then you present that as an idea – for example do you 
want to get taller or do you want to get faster – he’ll go huh?  
 
 
Well, think about it. How do you think Steve Nash did it? Isn’t that a choice 
multiplier? Do you see why I’m hesitating to give you an actual specific 
language pattern to achieve these things, because that would be a great 
disserve to you.  
 
 
You can do it in many different ways. It’s more about what is the impact 
you’re having and what tools can you put out there? That’s a great example 
for it. Thank you for that. 
 
 
Okay, I think it’s time to progress. We’ve got a good concept of what those 
two problem destroyers are about. Is that right?  
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
 
The next problem destroyer I want to talk about is going to be a little bit 
difficult to practice, so we’re going to set it up a little bit more as a role play 
just because this is something that you really have to catch in the moment on.  
 
 
This is not something that you can spend a minute and just get straight to the 
point you want to get to. The emotional reframe is essentially what you saw 
happening up here when I think it was Joanne was up here.  
 
 
If you’ll recall, there was a lot of talking – I need to have trust and so on – and 
at one point, especially those of you in the front rows, you could see her 
whole body starting to quiver or shake, which is a sign of strong emotion – it 
could be positive or it could be negative – which means you have the 
emotional part of the reframe. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
450 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Then the way you use it is very simple. Once you know it’s positive – and I’ll 
give you a little step-by-step process for this – all you have to do is in the full 
knowledge – I call it the state access principle. It’s called state-dependent 
learning.  
 
 
When they’re in a very positive state, their thinking will be more positive and 
their intuitive leaps will be towards positive ideas. Does that make sense to 
you? All you do then is you use that emotional energy to drive an intuitive 
leap towards a better idea. 
 
 
I’ll give you a clunky version of it with the understanding of course there are 
many ways to do it. If someone is feeling a strong emotion, how is that 
feeling? It’s intense, it’s great.  
 
 
So, I wonder what this means now or what this whole emotion is going to 
teach you about whatever the problem was, or overcoming whatever the 
problem was. In Joanne’s case I believe it was something along the lines of it’s 
very strong. Yes, it’s very strong.  
 
 
I have a sense that this is already teaching you something about improving 
your Mind Bending Language, maybe in ways you haven’t even considered 
before. Can you see how I’ve just tied the emotional reframe with the choice 
multiplier?  
 
 
I’ve used the emotional reframe to start launching an intuitive leap and then 
I’ve attached the choice multiplier at the end to start widening the scope, 
because when you’re learning is it better to have an open mind or a closed 
one? Was that psychologically leading or logically leading? 
 
Student: Both. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Do you get the idea of the emotional reframe? There are three simple 
steps that I’m going to ask you to go through in the emotional reframe.  
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
      -Check 
 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
451 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
When you actually spot some kind of emotional response going on – which I 
think you guys are pretty good at doing right now – the nice part about 
spotting an emotional reframe is if the emotion is so subtle that you can’t see 
it, it’s not enough. 
 
 
So, it’s only the ones that you can see that are actually worth using. First of 
all, you want to check to be double sure that the emotion they’re 
experiencing is actually a useful one, because strong emotions – whether 
positive or negative – tend to have similar physiologies.  
 
 
If someone’s shaking and tearing up and breathing heavily, are they just 
having the most wonderful sensation of love wash over them or are they on 
the verge of panic? Which is it? To be honest with you, you have no idea. They 
both look the same.  
 
 
When someone has an intense positive emotion, they can physically be 
shaking, their eyes will tear up, they may actually be crying. There’s no way 
for you to tell until you check – or at least in my experience. If you guys know 
better, then by all means teach me. 
 
 
My preference is if I see something that looks like a strong emotional 
response, just check. The way I check is kind of an acknowledgment at the 
same time. I’ll say it seems that something just arose. Can you feel that? They 
say yes. Or it seems like some strong emotion just came, didn’t it? Yes. What 
is that?  
 
 
That’s a very neutral check. Or do you like it? What’s the implication there? If 
they like it, it’s going to be positive. If they don’t like it, it’s going to be 
negative overall, unless of course they have some unusual wiring going on. So, 
do you understand the importance of checking? 
 
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
-Check 
 
-Acknowledge/Intensify 
 
 
After checking, I’ll acknowledge it again and intensify it. Can you feel that? 
Yes. What is that? It’s just amazing. That tells me it’s a positive thing, right? I

don’t need to know more than that. That’s right. It really is amazing, isn’t it? Is 
it getting stronger yet?  
 
 
Part of the reason for checking for strength or suggesting is it getting stronger 
yet is just so I can have a much more powerful state. As a rule, the more 
powerful the emotion, the better the emotional reframe works because 
emotions break normal thinking patterns.  
 
 
The other reason for it is I want to see if there is any cap or limitation on it. 
Joanne was a great example for it because at first she felt a warm glow of love 
but there was a cap on it. Do you remember that? When I asked her is it 
growing, she said no. What’s missing? Well, it’s all this other stuff.  
 
 
That told me that the door is opened a crack but it’s not opened enough for 
all the good stuff to come flowing through. So, I’m not going to attempt an 
emotional reframe until I know all the obstacles have been dissolved. Do you 
see how that works?  
 
Student: You sort of answered my question. So, basically acknowledging and intensify it 
only if it’s positive and if it’s negative then… 
 
Igor: 
If it’s negative, you go right back to your normal probing questions.  
 
Student: So, you don’t find some way of lessening it? 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this. What makes you think that by probing a negative 
emotion with Mind Bending Language won’t have the effect of releasing 
whatever keeps it in place? 
 
Student: Understood. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
That was mildly psychologically leading and somewhat logically as well – or 
maybe it’s the other way around. It doesn’t matter too much what the 
distinctions are. It matters what the effect is. It’s like with Mind Bending 
Language, it doesn’t matter what categories – space, time, energy and so on. 
What matters is can you do it and can you play with the range? 
 
Student: I’m sorry. You just lost me on that last point. If you probe a negative emotion, 
you’re not going to intensify it; you’re going to collapse it?

Igor: 
I didn’t say that. There is absolutely a possibility for intensifying it. It just 
comes down to the nature of your probing. Let’s say someone is feeling 
afraid.  
 
 
You say what’s going on right now? I feel afraid. What do you think that’s 
about? Well, there’s this thing I may have to do and I don’t want to do it. So, 
what are all the ways of coping with that that you haven’t allowed yourself to 
even consider yet? Do you think that’s going to increase or decrease the fear 
overall? Decrease, right? When I say you probe the actual problem – the 
negative emotion in this sense – it is not to suggest that you’re probing it to 
intensify it.  
 
 
Remember, all questions are leading by nature. You can lead into darkness or 
out of it. One of the problems that people have with negative emotions is 
they try to reject them rather than process them.  
 
 
Remember, what you resist will persist. What you accept you gain the power 
to transform, which is just another way of saying that when you try to forget 
about and push to one side will continue. It’s a little subroutine that hasn’t 
done its job yet. 
 
 
When you can accept it enough to process it, it will dissolve and release. A 
little information in neuroscience on emotions – do you know that any 
emotional state you’ve had bar none, that you’ve ever had and will have, can 
only last a maximum of 90 seconds.  
 
 
That’s how long the chemical signature of the hormones that get dumped to 
create whatever emotional experience you’re having can last. By then they’re 
eradicated and the only way someone can maintain or intensify emotion is to 
do it again and again and again – in other words to continuously keep 
dumping those same hormones and chemicals into the system. 
 
 
So, they’re actively doing something – albeit at the unconscious level – to 
have that emotional experience. When you help them process it, you can 
literally have someone within 30 to 90 seconds just totally go from panic to 
joy that quickly. 
 
 
The only reason it doesn’t happen that quickly in normal life is because we 
have a lifetime of experiences on how to hold on, and those are the locks that 
we have to find a combination to in order to be able to open the door again

and let everything flow through. Does that help you understand emotional 
reframes in a slightly different light? 
 
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
-Check 
 
-Acknowledge/Intensify 
 
-Reframe 
 
 
The final step – you’ve already heard me do it – is the actual reframe itself. 
The reframe, the way I do it anyway, is open-ended – I wonder what that has 
to teach you. I have a sense that you’re already learning something.  
 
 
I am presupposing within my question, am I not? I’m psychologically leading 
with my question or even with a statement in this sense, but you can see the 
whole train of experiences that will lead to an intuitive leap of insight.  
 
 
By insight, I don’t mean intellectual insight. That can be useful in some 
contexts. In this context, it’s more about an emotional catharsis, an intuitive 
leap or an insight in an emotional experience so they can transform with it. 
Do you get the idea of the emotional reframes? 
 
 
What I want to do now is I want to give you a chance to actually practice this, 
but because this is not something that you can just turn on and off like a tap, 
it’s going to be very difficult to just go straight for it if we just went for the 
actual experience. 
 
 
So, the easiest way to actually practice this is to do a role play. In a moment, 
I’m going to have you standing up and going around and having a chat with 
people. I’d like to just throw out a pretend problem. This is just a role play 
anyways. 
 
 
 
Then you will get a chance to probe the pretend problem with a little bit of 
Mind Bending Language as well. Then the person who had the “problem” very 
quickly – I mean we’re talking about like 20 seconds in – will feign an intense 
positive emotion like this. Is that fake? Can you recognize it? That’s all we 
need.

This is not faking an intense positive emotion. We’re not looking at any kind of 
Paul Ekman style micro muscular movements or anything like that. All you’re 
really doing is you’re allowing a normal interaction to occur. You’re going to 
mold that into a probing interaction.  
 
 
You’re going to then model or role play an emotion arising just to get the 
steps in a mechanical sequence. When you see it, then just go through the 
three steps.  
 
1. Check to see what just happened.  
 
 
What’s that? I sense something happened. What is it? That looks like a strong 
emotion. What would call that? I don’t care how you check but you want to 
check to make sure it’s positive rather than negative. 
 
2. Acknowledge and intensify. 
 
 
 
The simplest way of doing this is saying that’s right, or yeah that’s pretty 
interesting or wow it’s amazing. Is it getting stronger? Do you think it’s getting 
stronger, or is it strong enough already? Again, choose your language as the 
moment dictates.  
 
3. Finally, once you have a sense of it escalating or kind of bubbling over 
in enthusiasm, just present your reframe. 
 
 
Again, the reframe is very open-ended. It’s kind of like a choice multiplier but 
it’s more about a transformation – I wonder how this experience is going to 
change the way you feel about X or think about X or transform the whole 
situation, or I have a sense you’re already learning something. 
 
 
Do you see the implications I’m throwing out here? I don’t want to give you a 
particular language pattern because that wouldn’t do you any good at that. 
That would just send you back to being clunky. 
 
 
It’s a pretty straightforward process. Are there any questions? All right, 
everyone stand up please. We’re going to do this as a mingling exercise, so 
you’ll have about five minutes to mingle with as many people as possible, 
which means do this in 60 seconds. Then give them a chance to do it and then 
move on because it’s a mechanical process anyway. Off you go.

Was that interesting? Was that fun? It’s relatively straightforward to do an 
emotional reframe, right? The key here isn’t so much hunting for it, although 
there will be certain conversations where you can feel it starting to bubble up. 
It’s really more a question of catching it when it does. 
 
 
That’s kind of true of the other two as well. You’re catching the opportunity 
rather than going hunting for it just because that’s the easy way of doing it, or 
at least that’s how I do it. Are there any questions about that or can we go 
onto the next one? 
 
Objection Destroyer 
 
Igor: 
The next one actually comes to your point from earlier, which is what I call the 
objection destroyer. The objection destroyer is actually a research 
phenomenon, which we’re going to polish. It goes back to the radio 
conversation or the radio advert that you were mentioning.  
 
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
-Check 
 
-Acknowledge/Intensify 
 
-Reframe 
4. Objection Destroyer 
 
 
Let me give you a couple of the studies that show the effect. One study was in 
a supermarket in Europe, I believe, but don’t quote me on that. You know 
how in supermarkets they have these little cheese stands where you try a 
little bit of cheese and then you go buy some?  
 
 
They had a particular cheese that was going to be expensive. It was about 10 
dollars or 10 Euros or 10 pounds. So, people would come in and try the 
cheese out and invariably they’d say oh how much is it?  
 
 
Here’s where the objection destroyer came in. In the controlled experiment 
they just gave the price – it’s just ten dollars. The just is a little bit of a 
reframe, right? And a certain percent of people bought. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
457 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
In the actual trial to test the effect of this, when people asked how much does 
it cost, they said oh, it’s a thousand cents – pause – that’s just ten dollars to 
you and me. Can you notice the mind bending moment right there?  
 
 
That word – it’s just ten dollars – in other words that’s the actual reframe – 
produced significantly more sales when it was preceded by a mind bending 
moment – a thousand cents. I can’t give you the numbers but it’s something 
like 20 to 50%. 
 
 
Another study had exactly the same effect. This one was done in America on a 
campus where again it was exactly the same conditions. In the control 
experiment they had people selling cupcakes for a dollar – or whatever they 
go for nowadays.  
 
 
People said oh cupcakes, yummy, thank you very much and they bought 
them. Then they just noticed how many people would stop and actually buy 
one. In the actual experiment the sign read, Half Cakes Only A Dollar Each. 
 
 
Does anyone here have any idea what a half cake is? It’s a cupcake that bends 
your mind. In the half cake experiment, again more people were buying the 
half cakes than the cupcakes because again it didn’t fit in your routine of 
thinking. It disturbed that routine and in doing so the reframe had a stronger 
ability to actually work.  
 
 
In the radio advert you quoted, it’s the same thing again. We’ll give you 
$3,000 for your clunker and so on. So, people are getting moved down one 
particular track – for your 2006 model – oh that must be what a clunker is 
now. It’s been redefined. 
 
 
That’s a classic reframe at that point. Do you understand the pattern that 
we’re talking about here? Jules, if you’ll stand up we’ll get a mic to you. 
 
Jules: 
Very quickly another quick example that worked in my life is one time my wife 
brought home a cat, a stray. It’s a continuation of many different pets that 
we’ve enjoyed, but this one was pregnant and we ended up with a litter full of 
cats that we really weren’t prepared to have. 
 
 
So, at first we posted them in the local paper and nobody called. Nobody 
wants free cats. At the time I was studying marketing and I came back home 
and I rewrote the ad. I wrote, Ugly Kittens $20. We got literally hundreds of 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
458 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
calls and sold them each for $20, when we couldn’t even give them away. The 
calls were all the same – how ugly are these cats? Oh, they’re really ugly.  
 
Igor: 
You have a whole new industry right there, don’t you?  
 
Student: About the cupcake/half cake, personally I would just buy that out of curiosity, 
not because it frames anything else.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Think about what state of mind you’re in when your amygdala gets 
triggered. What state of mind have you been trying to get people into mostly 
here? Thinking, right? What’s curiosity if not thinking? 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, I’ll try this out. What you’re basically describing is the after effect of 
having your amygdala triggered in a positive way. You’re correct, absolutely. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
The same is true of ugly kittens. They’re just curious. Yeah, I want to have an 
ugly kitten. Mine’s uglier than yours. No, mine is. I love that.  
 
Student: Thank you. Coming back to your grocery situation, there was a store that got 
all these cases of bananas and they were regular bananas but they had spots 
on them. So, the manager had to come up with an imaginative way to get rid 
of them. So, they had a sale. They called them Hawaiian bananas, and 
consequently everybody loved them and loved the idea and picked up the 
bananas.  
 
Igor: 
Right. Do you understand the nature of the objection destroyer? If we’re 
going to put a pattern around it, here are the kinds of rules to make the 
objection destroyer work. 
 
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
-Check 
 
-Acknowledge/Intensify 
 
-Reframe

4. Objection Destroyer 
 
-MBL Probe 
 
 
Actually, first you have whatever your setup is. You have your normal 
conversation and so on. Just before you present your reframe or your idea, 
you have a Mind Bending Language probe. By probe, I mean the probing 
questions you’ve been playing with basically for the last two or three days. 
 
 
Let’s use an actual objection. If someone says that costs too much, what 
might be a mind bending probe on that? How much exactly is too much and 
how much less would be enough? Or how much less value do you want so you 
can afford it? Or are you really saying that you can afford this; it’s just you 
don’t know if it’s valuable enough yet?  
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? You can hear the Mind Bending 
Language and the spins going on kind of in the background. The key here is 
you’re going to have a little bit of a probing question to kind of get their mind 
opened up a bit, and then you present your reframe. It’s as simple as that. 
 
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
-Check 
 
-Acknowledge/Intensify 
 
-Reframe 
4. Objection Destroyer 
 
-MBL Probe 
 
-Reframe 
 
 
Your reframe is, look at it another way. So, the Mind Bending Language makes 
them think. It makes them stop and go yeah I’ve got to really consider that 
and, and the reframe helps them with how to consider it.  
 
 
To use the ‘it costs too much’ example again, it seems to be costing too much 
right now. I have a question for you. How much value will you need to get out 
of this for you to be able to afford it at this price? What? 
 
 
Well, think about it. It’s either that you don’t physically have the money or 
you don’t think this is worth the price I just quoted. Now if it’s the former, 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
460 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
then we might be able to find something better for you that will fit and if it’s 
the latter, then let me show you what this really does.  
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? Are there any questions on that? To 
practice the objection destroyer, we’re going to do a role play again and this 
one again is going to be a little bit mechanical.  
 
 
Just as you did a moment ago, I’m going to ask you to walk around and do this 
and do it quick and zingy and zappy. It can be a little bit clunky because I just 
want you to get used to the idea, and then it will refine itself as you integrate 
it into your normal conversational style – which you already have, by the way. 
You’ve all done all the hard parts already over the last few days. 
 
5 Most Common Objections 
 
Igor: 
I want you to just cycle through the five most common objections you’re most 
likely to meet. I have to thank my good friend, Joe Homs. Joe is a great 
salesman and works a lot with businesspeople, so he deals with this on a daily 
basis. These are the most common objections that typically come out. 
 
 
We’ll go through them one by one and you’ll get a chance to do the objection 
destroyer on each style of objection, so you get a little bit familiar with them 
and the maneuvers. Then you can home and think about it some more to 
figure out an actual context where you want to be using that. Make senses? 
 
 
I’m going to give you objections that specifically fit the sales context. 
However, the objection destroyer does not have to fit the sales context. It can 
fit I’m too short for basketball. That fits in an objection destroyer as well, 
doesn’t it?  
 
 
The objection is I’m too short. Then the very reframe is to consider Steve 
Nash. You can say are you short enough to match Steve Nash? Do you see 
how that again is an objection destroyer in a non-sales situation?  
 
 
These common objections specifically meet the sales context and I’m only 
using them here for you to get the facility with the objection destroyer in the 
full knowledge that you can use it in many other places too. Is that agreement 
we can make?

5 Most Common Objections: 
1. I Don’t Have Enough…Money, Time, Etc. 
 
 
The first one is really the one we’ve just been playing with. The first one 
follows the structure of - I don’t have enough whatever. 
 
 
The two most common things that get filled in the blank are time or money. 
Often it’s both. There are other things people don’t have enough of to object 
to whatever you’re offering them, but those tend to be the two biggest ones 
bar none. Does everyone get the idea for those? 
 
 
What we’re going to do now is everyone please stand up. You’re going to walk 
around and meet as many people as possible, and you’re looking for 30- to 
60-second interactions. Hey, how’s it going?  
 
 
Make them some kind of an offer. Say hey do you want to buy this? Then 
they’ll say oh I haven’t got enough to do that or I haven’t got enough money 
or I haven’t got enough aliens to support me in this. I don’t care what it is as 
long as it follows that ‘I don’t have enough’ structure. 
 
 
Just sell a pen or a pencil and say hey I’ve got a pen here or I’ve got a pencil. If 
you want to buy it, it’s ten bucks. They’ll say I haven’t got that much money. 
Keep it simple. It’s really a role play at this point  
 
 
Your job is to just simply the objection destroyer, probe a little bit with some 
little mind bending spins within that and just as they’re going huh, offer your 
reframe – this is a special pen, it’s made of gold, now it’s a bargain. 
 
 
Again, I don’t care too much about the content. It’s more that you’re doing 
the whole process. Is that okay with you? The only other thing I’ll add here – 
is it okay if we give you a magic Johnny whistle, which sounds like this, as we 
go along because I have five objections that I want to run through very 
quickly, and that way we can just keep this thing going? All right, off you go. 
 
 
Hopefully that was fun.

5 Most Common Objections: 
1. I Don’t Have Enough…Money, Time, Etc. 
2. Something’s Blocking Me… 
 
 
 
The next one just to move on with the same momentum is along the lines of - 
something’s blocking me.  
 
 
 
Here are some examples of it: 
 
 Oh, I don’t know.  
 I don’t feel right about it yet.  
 I have to think about it.  
 I’ve got to take care of the kids.  
 
 
Basically they’ll present an obstacle that is “insurmountable.” For example: 
 
 I’ve got to think about it some more. 
 I don’t like to be rushed into a decision like this. 
 I don’t feel right about it now. 
 I have this constraint blocking me. 
 I’ve got to talk to my husband or wife or aliens from Mars, therapists 
with a pigtail or whatever you want to call it.  
 
 
 
Do you get the idea? So, number two is again an objection destroyer, same 
offer – a pencil or whatever – off you go.  
 
 
How did that go? Good? Are you enjoying that?  
 
 
 
5 Most Common Objections: 
1. I Don’t Have Enough…Money, Time, Etc. 
2. Something’s Blocking Me… 
3. Dabbler 
 
 
 
The third kind of objection is more a mindset. We call it the dabbler. 
 
 
This is the kind of person who says to you oh I’ve tried that before and it 
didn’t work. They’re the people who have tried pretty much a little bit of 
everything but they never bother to actually give it enough time to get its real 
value out of it. 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
463 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
With the Mind Bending Language, the reframe I’ll run on that is basically the 
idea of dabbling versus debt but doing it in a way that’s not going to be 
insulting. Do you get the idea of this one? You don’t get the idea here? I’ll give 
you an example on one condition. You do not use it. Is that a deal we can 
make? 
 
 
Honestly, I would do you a great disservice if I just gave you one stock reframe 
and you’re stuck with that. You’ve got to be able to fit the situation. So, the 
dabbler says I’ve tried that before and it didn’t work. Then you’ll have to do a 
little bit of probing and say okay when you say you tried it before, what 
exactly have you done? 
 
 
Oh, I bought a pen at the dollar store and two minutes later it was broken and 
a waste of my money. You say great, aside from that pen what are all the pens 
that will last longer. What? Think about it. When you pay for quality, you’re 
actually paying for a lifespan.  
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? That’s one example, which you may 
not use because each industry will be different, each person will be different 
and each conversation will actually be more elaborate than this. This is just 
the mechanical way of getting into this.  
 
 
When you get back to doing regular conversations with people, you’ll get to 
explore this much more at your leisure and you’ll have five or 10 minutes to 
really get a sense of what’s going on and really transform someone’s life 
whilst destroying the objection. You appreciate why we’re doing this, yes? All 
right, do you all understand the exercise? Start now. 
 
 
How did that go? Was that fun?  
 
 
 
 
5 Most Common Objections: 
1. I Don’t Have Enough…Money, Time, Etc. 
2. Something’s Blocking Me… 
3. Dabbler 
4. I Need X Before I Can Have Y 
 
 
The next one is an interesting one - I need X before I can have Y.

By the way, this is a typical life pattern that a lot of people get into. I can’t be 
happy until I have the fast car and the trophy wife and the big cash bonus, etc. 
In my case, it happens to be true. 
 
 
Usually in life the opposite is true. When you have Y, it will be easy to get X. 
That tends to be the rule. The same is true in objections. If someone says I 
need more experience before I can go to that seminar, or I need to learn how 
to write before I can buy a pen, typically it’s the opposite way around. You 
need a pen in order to learn how to write. 
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? This is actually a very easy one to 
deal with. The reframe is already inherent in the structure of the problem. So, 
you do a little mind bending probe and then the reframe is basically to 
reverse the formula and say as soon as you have Y, you can start getting X. Do 
you understand the nature of that one? Easy? Off you go. 
 
 
 
5 Most Common Objections: 
1. I Don’t Have Enough…Money, Time, Etc. 
2. Something’s Blocking Me… 
3. Dabbler 
4. I Need X Before I Can Have Y 
5. I Don’t Believe You 
 
 
The last common objection is a trick one. That’s why we left it till the end - I 
don’t believe you. 
 
 
There are essentially two things that are going on here. They may happen at 
the same time or they may not. Either you have a lack of rapport, which 
means in terms of your RIP Formula you’ve missed the first step up and you 
have to go back into square one again. That can be quite common. 
 
 
The other one – and it can be related to this as well – is they have examples in 
their life when they’ve failed before, so they’re afraid to believe you about 
that. For example, someone might say its’ interesting what you’re saying 
except I don’t think that pen will last very long.  
 
 
The solution to that one – actually you can use the Mind Bending Language 
probe for this as well – is to lock them into a position and then give them a 
counter example.

Here’s what I mean by that. Let’s say this pen will write upside down. Have 
you seen the Russian space pen? If you haven’t seen it, the American space 
pen costs like $10 million to develop. It writes upside down and under water 
and all the rest of it. It’s got this crazy ink and it’s all crazy stuff. 
 
 
The Russian space pen cost them less than 10 cents. It’s called a pencil. You 
can actually buy the Russian space pen online for a little bit more than 10 
cents. It’s very funny.  
 
 
Then if someone says I don’t believe this will write upside down, you say oh 
let me just clarify here. Are you saying that you don’t believe that this pen will 
write upside down? I can hear you saying that, but are you suggesting then 
that if you knew absolutely that this pen does write upside down that you’d 
buy it on the spot. Is that what you’re saying to me? 
 
 
You’re locking them in. If they say no at that point, there’s other stuff going 
on and you have to explore that. If that is really the only objection and that’s 
the honest objection, then they’ll say yes. Great, here’s a piece of paper, 
here’s my pencil. There’s your reframe. 
 
 
It’s actually an action. You could take a counter example of having a 
testimonial of someone coming in and saying yes this is really good, I’ve done 
it and it works. That can work excellently as well, only – and this is a caveat – 
if they don’t believe you because there’s a lack of rapport, they won’t believe 
the other testimonial by extension. 
 
 
Does that make sense to you? This is a trickier one. Hence, we’ll work on I 
don’t believe the actual claim as opposed to I don’t believe you because you 
haven’t got rapport, because those are two difference scenarios that may be 
expressed similarly. Do you understand what I’m talking about here? Off you 
go and reframe their belief. 
 
 
How did that go?  
 
Student: It went really awesome.  
 
Igor: 
Good. 
 
Student: It’s kind of interesting because you’re just really trying to understand where 
they’re coming from, and with the right questions you can kind of enter their

world and explore it together, and if it really isn’t the right thing for them, 
then you won’t even feel honest or sincere about trying to give it to them. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. In fact you’ve just come onto the heart of the sales process, which 
we’ll come to after the break. Well done. Excellent. What else did you guys 
notice? 
 
Student: I noticed the more ridiculous things you sold, the more comfortable you got. I 
sold being a male stripper. I told everybody. 
 
Igor: 
Do you have a couple of ten dollar bills in your waistband now? 
 
Student: I do. I pick up everything with everything else besides my hands. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. By the way, this is an important principle here in general, which is 
if you do push yourself to an edge, then when you come back to normality 
again it actually is a lot easier because you’ve kind of stretched yourself out a 
little bit. There’s an old boxing saying. Train hard, fight easy. Do you get the 
idea? 
 
Student: A quick question on the ‘I don’t believe you.’ I don’t think in my experience 
that they’ll actually say that but they’ll come up with other stuff. 
 
Igor: 
True. This is why we do the whole Mind Bending Language thing. They’ll 
express it as a doubt about something else and say oh I don’t know about this 
thing, I’m not sure about this thing. That’s usually how they’ll be socially 
polite about saying I don’t believe you.  
 
 
The nature of the conversation will kind of give you an implication, which you 
can pick up on. Typically what I’ll do is say let me just check with you. What is 
it you’re not sure about? Is it that you don’t believe this pen will actually write 
upside down, or is it something else? I’m actually going to do it for them.  
 
 
So, you’re correct, in normal conversations or normal situations, people are 
less likely to say that. Of course in some contexts, they will actually say it right 
out. In a business context like purchasers or something like that, people use it 
as a negotiation tactic. They’ll say I don’t believe you. That will actually be a 
tactic but that’s a different context specifically for a corporate context, and in 
the other one you need a little bit of mindreading and flush it out for them. 
Does that help?

Student: I wasn’t awesome at it but I was having a lot of fun and I got to sell a few crazy 
things. Then when I thought of doing it in terms of me offering a service, I just 
sort of froze and I realized it just isolated the issue for me, which is lack of 
confidence in the product when the product is me. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly, and that goes right to the heart of the whole sales process. If you 
want to have a sense of how to deal with that, then you’d better come back 
after the break nice and sharp.

DVD 15 – The MBL 5 Minute Sales Method 
 
 
The 5 Minute Sales Method 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed your break. Before the break, you had a 
chance to play with the objection destroyer and some of the more common 
objections and an interesting idea came up, which is the realization – and I’m 
glad that you made it yourself, that really often in the sales process the real 
difficultly you will have, and this is one of the reasons I think people get like 
the snake oil salesman type thing, is because there’s a disconnect. 
 
 
There’s a cognitive dissonance between what they think the value they have 
is and what they’re trying to sell. That’s why, for example the gentleman here 
the other day, said I could peddle my services. What is that saying to you 
about his inferences about what he’s doing? 
 
 
Even if it’s considered a little joke – you know the old phrase many a true 
word is spoken in jest – that’s why I joke about microwaving babies a lot. Oh 
come on, that deserves a better laugh. If you’re looking at me shocked like is 
he serious now, then you’re doing me a great disservice. 
 
Student: How much are you willing to pay for a laugh? 
 
Igor: 
There used to actually be a profession called the claquers, who would go into 
theaters and then have a tariff rate from mild applause through to standing 
ovation and you had to pay more depending on how much they would get the 
crowd going for you. It was actually a profession. 
 
 
That little interesting trivia aside, I find one of the biggest stumbling blocks in 
the whole sales process starts before you even open your mouth and it’s in 
your attitude. This is especially true of anyone in a caring profession. I know a 
lot of you are hypnotherapists or coaches and so on, so it’s very important to 
realize that what we have to offer is genuinely valuable. 
 
 
Here’s the interesting thing. If I asked you consciously is what you do valuable, 
you’d say yes of course it is. If I probed a little bit, for many people that starts 
falling apart and there’s an insecurity underneath it all.

So, the very first thing I would like you to do is to find a partner in a moment 
and I want you to spend five minutes – not a long time, but just five minutes – 
having a conversation with that person about some aspect of their life where 
they need to be a decent salesperson.  
 
 
If you’re a hypnotherapist, you’re selling to clients. If you own your own 
business, you’re selling to clients. If you’re a parent, you may well be selling 
the idea of parenting to your children or the idea of education to your 
children. If you’re a teacher, you may well be selling the idea of biology of 
physics and getting inspired by that. 
 
 
If you doubt your own worth in biology or physics and so on, how on Earth are 
the people you’re trying to teach that going to get excited? Do you see where 
I’m going with this?  
 
 
Let me ask it this way. Do all of you have one area in your life in mind in which 
you want to be more influential in this way? We’ll call it sales for now, 
although we’re taking a broader term for sales rather than just a transaction 
of cash for goods or services. 
 
 
Can you all think of a specific context in which you want to be doing that right 
now? Does anyone have trouble with that? Excellent. So, spend five minutes 
apiece, 10 minutes in total, with a partner and use all the tools you’ve got, 
everything you’ve been doing for the last five days to help probe with them to 
find just one thing of genuine value in what you’re doing. 
 
 
You’ll know its genuine value because they’ll say yeah that’s really valuable or 
they’re going to say yes! I really believe that! You can see the different, right? 
Now of course there will be many things of great value and this is an idea that 
you need to explore thoroughly but not in here because this is training rather 
than therapy, and so we want to give you a starting point rather than an end 
point. Make sense? 
 
Student: I don’t get it. The exercise is I’m trying to sell what I feel is valuable? 
 
Igor: 
Let me ask you this. What is the area that you want to be more influential or 
sell something in? Do you want to sell books? Do you want to sell to your 
clients to come to therapy? Do you want to sell a seminar? 
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
470 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Training programs. 
 
Igor: 
A training program. Excellent. So, you’re going to get with your partner and 
they’re going to say what is it you’re really talking about? Oh, I want to find 
some value in my training programs. Then they’ll ask you what are you 
training in? Why do you want to be training in that? What is it that you have 
to offer people?  
 
 
So, you as the questionee get to discover or explore your value as a trainer in 
this context. Then when your five minutes are up, you’ll switch roles and 
you’ll question them to help them find their value in whatever it is that 
they’re trying to sell more of. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you all understand the exercise?  
 
 
How did the exercise go? Was that fun? Give yourselves a round of applause. 
Did you learn something about yourself and what you have to offer? Is this an 
idea that’s worth exploring further? Good, I agree with you. We’ll come back 
to this idea more in due course as we elaborate it. 
 
 
Right now we’re developing the background for a sales process. There’s no 
point in having a sales process unless you have something to sell. With the 
pencil role play and so on, that was just an interesting role play to do it 
mechanically but really when you leave here, you want to be able to do 
something with this stuff, right?  
 
 
Now you already have a lot of tools to be very influential. Who here feels their 
ability to be influential has already skyrocketed? I want you to be able to 
channel that particular influence into a sales process, one which works in five 
minutes. 
 
 
I call it the five-minute sales method. Sometimes, I have to warn you, it takes 
a bit longer. It takes 10 minutes. It just depends on your level of experience in 
the particular field you’re doing sales in – I’ll explain more as we develop the 
idea here – but it should be fast, it should be easy and it actually should be 
effortless.

It should be a real pleasure for you to engage in a sales process because it’s 
more like helping another human being thrive in a way that they need to. 
 
 
 
The 5 Minute Sales Method: 
1. Background 
 
-Find Genuine Value In What You Do 
 
-Identify Genuine Need 
 
The first step is understanding that what you have to offer is of value.  If you 
do not have anything of value to offer, you have no business offering it. It’s 
not that kind of sales program. If you want to go to evil hypnosis school and 
learn how to sell snake oil, then by all means do so but you will also pay the 
consequences of that.  
 
 
We’re talking about a healthy business where you have a long-term customer 
relationship, etc. This is the first step. The second step is to identify a genuine 
need in your potential market, audience, people or whatever. 
 
 
Frankly the need must match the value that you have. Otherwise it’s not 
valuable, is it? If I have a bottle of water and I offer to a man in a desert who’s 
dying of thirst, that’s of great value, isn’t it? If I have a bottle of water and I 
offer it to a person who’s got a fridge full of bottles of water, is that 
particularly valuable to them? 
 
 
If I try to sell it to someone who’s trying to get rid of too many bottles of 
water in their house, is there any value there at all? So, the problem isn’t that 
what you have to offer at that point is not valuable. It’s there’s no need in the 
other person and that’s the second part – the background shall we say – that 
you have to have in place for a sale to occur naturally. 
 
 
Again, if there is no need, you have no business selling it. Does that make 
sense? So, I’d like you to turn to your partners or the person next to you just 
briefly.  
 
 
It will literally just be a one-minute discussion and all I want you to do, 
knowing that you have a value of some sort – you’ve found at least one thing 
of value in what you have to offer, is that correct? 
 
 
I would like for you to describe it to the person next to you in literally just one 
minute, so you have two minutes only for this exercise. Describe to them who 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
472 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
needs this. In other words, who would be your ideal customer? It makes 
sense, doesn’t it? All right, do that now. 
 
 
That was easy, wasn’t it? So, you all have a sense of what your value is and 
where there’s a need that actually wants that value. Is that correct? The third 
part of this background process – this is before you get into the whole sales 
thing in the first place. 
 
 
 
The 5 Minute Sales Method: 
1. Background 
 
-Find Genuine Value In What You Do 
 
-Identify Genuine Need 
 
-Construct An Irresistible Offer 
 
 
 
You’ve got to construct an irresistible offer. Now there are many different 
ways you can do this, and there’s a lot of information that goes into this, so it 
really lies outside of the context of this course. This is Advanced Mind Bending 
Language For Influence, not a business method course, not a sales training 
course. We’re just giving you a sales method to take home with you. 
 
 
So, I’m going to give you a really rough guide – and I’m talking about a really 
rough guide – on how to construct something of value, an irresistible offer, 
with the understanding that this is the equivalent of a stickman and I need 
you to go out and paint a Mona Lisa. 
 
 
Here’s the rule of thumb: 
 
1. As the need goes up, the price goes up. As the need goes down, the 
price goes down.  
 
 
Another rule of thumb is: 
 
2. As the value goes up, the price goes up. As the value goes down, the 
price goes down. 
 
 
There are lots of different ways of having value – availability, exclusivity, time, 
effort, specialty knowledge. There are all kinds of ways of adding value, but 
again that’s something you can investigate on your own time. If you need to 
know more about that sort of thing, the Hypnotherapy Business Method goes 
into that sort of stuff in much more detail. 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
473 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
So, as the need goes up, the price goes up. As the need goes down, the price 
goes down and the same is true with the value. There’s a third element, which 
is interesting and this is a much lesser rule of thumb. It doesn’t hold true as 
often but it still holds true.  
 
3. As your client’s wealth goes up, the price goes up. As their wealth goes 
down, the price goes down. 
 
 
Here’s what I mean by that. If someone’s earning $20,000 a year and they 
need a life-saving operation, there comes a point at which they physically 
cannot afford it. In some instances, they may well perish because they could 
not afford the operation.  
 
 
Now I’m not going to make a social commentary on that either way. It’s just 
an economic fact at that point. Does that make sense to you? The reverse is 
also true. I’m not saying this to say oh just shaft the rich people. I’m talking 
about having a balance point.  
 
 
You have to know what your marketplace is. A wealthier marketplace will not 
respect a lower price. Like Jules’ kittens, they’re worth nothing for free. They 
were worth looking at for $20. This is a corollary to that particular rule, which 
is to say your price reflects the value in their eyes.  
 
 
If it’s free, what you’re saying is it’s worthless. If it’s $10, what you’re saying is 
it’s only worth a little bit. If it’s $10,000 – at least in the current market value 
of the dollar – you’re saying it’s worth quite a bit. Do you see where I’m going 
with this?  
 
 
So, you need to get those three things put together. What I want you to do 
now is we’re going to have a little bit of fun with this. You’re going to have 
literally three minutes, and you’re going to have to race around the room to 
do this. I’d like you to do this with at least 10 people in those three minutes.  
 
 
You’re going to go around and you’re going to construct an offer, and the only 
way you’re going to know how irresistible it is, is to test it out on people. 
We’re going to dispense with any formalities here. We’re going to do this in as 
a game rather than anything else.  
 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
474 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Just go up to someone and ask them do you need X – and that’s whatever 
your service is. Do you need to stop smoking with hypnotherapy? They will 
either say yes or they will say no. Your choice if you’re being asked the 
question is to randomly answer one or the other, and I mean just randomly. 
There’s no rhyme or reason on this one. 
 
 
If they say no, thank them very much and move on because you’re wasting 
your time. They don’t need it. If they say yes, ask them how much they need 
it. You can say a little bit or a lot. Again, whatever you feel like at that point in 
time.  
 
 
Based on what you’ve heard, reflect back to them and show them your value 
– whatever that thing of value is that you noticed. You’ll say I do X – whatever 
your value is – and that’s going to solve that problem that you need a lot or a 
little bit. Do you see how that works? 
 
 
Then ask them how much do you want it? Literally ask them how much are 
you willing to pay? And just see what happens. You just give an answer that 
seems appropriate. Do you understand the nature of the exercise?  
 
 
The exercise is simple. The bit that’s going to make it interesting for you is you 
need to talk to 10 people in three minutes.  
 
Student: How are we going to possibly do that? 
 
Igor: 
I know how you can possibly do that. Mathematically speaking, three minutes 
divided by 10 gives you 18 seconds, so you better talk fast. All right, up on 
your feet and off you go. 
 
 
Welcome back. We’ve set the foundations now that will allow us to actually 
have a sales method worth using. Before we move into the actual sales 
process, what have you learned so far? What have you discovered in terms of 
what you just did here? What ideas are different now that you didn’t have 
before? How do you view this sales process in a new light now? 
 
Student: What I’m noticing is that there has to be a need and if there is no need, move 
on and don’t take it personally. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. There are millions of people out there who want nothing to do 
with you, and not because they don’t like you but they don’t need it. Taking 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
475 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
things personally is one of the biggest problems that most salespeople have 
to deal with.  
 
 
Let’s put it this way. If you’ve got a plaster cast so you can fix a broken leg, are 
you going to go around to everyone saying can I put a plaster cast on your 
leg? It’s ridiculous, unless someone’s saying why are they rejecting me? I’m 
trying to help. 
 
 
By understanding the balance between value and need, you don’t get rejected 
because if they need it for real, as long as you can really get them to see that 
– and that’s what the sales process is about – they’ll take it. If they don’t need 
it, well then there’s no point putting a plaster cast on someone who hasn’t 
got a broken leg. It would be a very strange kind of decoration. Thank you for 
that. 
 
Student: As I was going around I was noticing that my price was going up, and I was 
actually doing better and better.  
 
Igor: 
So, you noticed that when your price goes up, you actually do better, right? 
Setting a price point on anything is an art. It’s a science and an art and there 
are a lot of variables that go into it. You can price yourself out of a market, 
and if you’re pricing yourself out of a market it’s because it’s too high or it’s 
too low.  
 
 
There’s a sweet spot, which is often actually surprising, and the only way you 
know is by testing things out. No one can tell you ahead of time what that 
sweet spot is. There are things that can predict the likely range of it, but the 
only way you’ll ever know is by testing it out and knowing. 
 
 
I’ll give you one more rule of thumb if I may on this. The rule of thumb is: 
 
4. The more successful you get, the higher your price should be. It’s just 
part of the value set.  
 
 
Is there anything else you learned?  
 
Student: What that particular exercise did was going back to what the lady mentioned, 
is need. But you had to crystallize that need in a very short concise timeframe. 
So, what I did was I used the word imagine and where they were. I’m in fire 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
476 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
protection. I said the fire is going right now. I live next door. I’m at the door 
right there. Would you invest that money to save your place? 
 
Igor: 
What you’re doing right now is you’re setting a constraint to make sure that 
the value of what you have to offer is instantly perceivable. We’ll get into that 
as we go along here a little bit. So, you’re a little ahead of the game, which is 
great. It’s a good instinct by the way. You’ll see when we go into this more. 
 
Student: One thing I recognized as we were running around this, for the service helping 
industry there’s basically remedial change and growth change. Remedial 
change typically is a need. Growth change is a want. Can you say some words 
about what’s important about that distinction? 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Just to put it into slightly different words, a remedial change is I 
have a problem and I want it fixed. I have a phobia, I can’t sleep and there’s 
pain attached to it. Pain is the major motivator there. 
 
 
In what I would call a generative change – or as you would call personal 
growth – is something along the lines of life is pretty sweet, but I’d just like it 
to be even better.  
 
 
For example, holidays often get sold as a generative thing – you deserve a 
holiday, treat yourself, take your family somewhere nice. Occasionally it’s sold 
as a remedial thing – take a break, you’ll burn out otherwise. What better 
than this so you can recover from days in the office? 
 
 
 
You see those adverts with the grey man in the grey suit living a really terrible 
life. Then they get the magic product and it’s all colorful and they sing and 
they dance and they’re so happy. They’re using remedial change, and of 
course a can of soda is going to do that for you. 
 
 
Here’s the interesting part. You won’t know whether a need or a want is more 
motivational for that person. You have to ask, and I’ll say one more thing. 
With each group, groups tend to do it in patterns. There are certain groups 
who respond better to an idea presented as a need, and others will respond 
to it better as an idea shaped as a want. Does that make sense?  
 
 
It does affect the price tag. It does affect your influencing cycle and so on. 
However, you can’t say one’s better than the other. It’s better for whom? 
That’s something we’ll be testing.

Student: When the gentleman spoke about fire protection and planting images in 
people’s heads, as hypnotherapists – for those of you who are trying to sell 
hypnotherapy – a question came to mind. They’re telling you all about their 
problem and if you say something like if you do nothing about this problem, 
what will happen in your life – it’s psychologically leading and it only gives 
them… 
 
Igor: 
If you had a problem and someone said that to you, how would you react? 
 
Student: I would say either nothing will happen in my life or I would see my life getting 
worse. 
 
Igor: 
Right. How worse? Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
Student: Yes, that’s why I just wanted to run it by you. 
 
Igor: 
We’re almost there. The opposite is also true. Again, that’s framed as a need. 
This is a great example. You framed it as a need right now – how much worse 
could it get? Phrasing it as a want, how would you do that? 
 
Student: What can you do right now with this therapy here today… 
 
Igor: 
Think about how much better your life will be when it’s gone. How will you 
feel? What will your wife say to you? What will your husband say to you when 
you come back and you look slim and trim? What are your children going to 
say? Mommy, you look so great. That’s a want. 
 
Student: So, take it from a need and flip it into a want? 
 
Igor: 
Depending on the person. You won’t know until you start talking to them, and 
each area, each market, each group of people will tend to have a pattern 
within them, so you’ll be able to predict more once you start speaking more 
to your clientele. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. Thank you.

Igor: 
Arthur has a question. 
 
Arthur: 
What happens if the target group doesn’t really know that they need the 
service, that it would be a benefit for them? 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Then we get right into the next process, which is step two. This is 
just a warm-up exercise. I know you’re a doctor. As a doctor, all you need to 
know is that they do need it.  
 
 
They may have no understanding of what it is they need or why they need it 
and so on, but you need to know that they need it and why, which is kind of 
what we’ve been doing so far.  
 
 
As to how you get them to perceive that they need it, that’s what we’re 
coming onto now. Please don’t think that the exercise you just did a moment 
ago is a recommendation for that’s how you do sales. You don’t walk around 
saying do you need this, great, here you go, buy it! 
 
 
It may work in some cases. It probably won’t work in many. It’s a warm-up 
exercise to get you to appreciate the distinctions between what your value is, 
where their need is and an offer that is genuinely irresistible because it 
matches the two together. It’s the bridge between their need and your value.  
 
Student: What I found was that people who don’t need to lose very much weight were 
easier to sell and would pay a lot more than people who needed to lose more 
weight. 
 
Igor: 
Right and that can be very true. Why do you think that is? 
 
Student: Maybe they can perceive themselves reaching their goals better. 
 
Igor: 
Right. It goes back to the ‘I don’t believe you’ objection, doesn’t it? It’s not 
that they don’t believe you as a person. They can’t believe that it’s possible 
for themselves because they’ve suffered so much, which goes right back to 
the objection destroyer and how to put that into a normal conversation, 
which is kind of what we’re getting into here.

So, it’s not that the people who need it the most don’t respond. It’s just they 
have more layers of defensiveness around it because they’ve already lost 
more hope. Does that kind of make sense? That was an excellent realization. 
 
Student: I know we’re just doing an exercise. There’s one thing that’s missing for me 
right now. May I ask a quick question about Mind Bending Language? 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. That’s exactly what we’re getting into right now, unless you’re 
about to ask me a quick question. 
 
Student: Well, once people meet a salesman, an invisible wall goes up. 
 
Igor: 
I’m totally with you on that 100%. Once again, this was all just background 
stuff to get the idea of values, needs and irresistible offers into you. Now 
we’re going to start looking at how we actually apply this know-how in an 
actual practical sense, which is really what you’re asking. 
 
 
How do you actually take this into the real world? That’s a good question to 
ask, isn’t it? To answer that question, the first thing I want you to do is find a 
partner that you’ll spend the spent the rest of this session with exploring that 
idea. 
 
 
Find a partner. As soon as you have them, sit down quietly and face the front 
so that we know to continue. Off you go. Find a partner. Just to double check, 
everyone has a partner right now, is that correct? You’ll be staying with that 
partner for the rest of this session as we unfold the sales method.  
 
 
Now let’s base this on what you already know. Do you recall from yesterday 
what the basic influence formula is? I’ll give you a hint. You’re going to kill all 
problems, which means they will Rest In Peace. What does the R stand for? 
Rapport.

Now there are a couple of things you’re trying to achieve in the rapport stage. 
You want to get into a natural conversation, which takes us to the first use of 
Mind Bending Language. 
 
 
Do you recall all the way back on your first day here, when you asked those 
questions – who are you, what do you do, where are you from – and you got 
those cycles of normal glib answers, and then you asked the questions a little 
differently and you got deeper responses? Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
Now you’ve come a long way since then. In other words, you don’t have to do 
it in quite the same clunky way this time, but I want you to start the rapport 
phrase with the same sort of hey how’s it going, who are you?  
 
 
You can put yourself in a scenario. If you’re more likely to meet your ideal 
customer at a seminar like this, then pretend you’re there. How are you 
enjoying the seminar? That’s easy to do in here, right? If you’re more likely to 
meet them at a more formal function, then pretend you’re there.  
 
 
Wherever you’re most likely to meet your idea client, pretend you’re there 
and you’re going to have just a normal everyday conversation. Does that 
make sense to you?  
 
 
My preference is if you put it into the context of some kind of a meeting 
group, like a meet-up thing or a social environment, because it’s the most 
informal and that’s the easiest place to be invisible. You can still do the more 
formal ones, it’s just that it will require minor tweaks on this.  
 
 
So, you’re going to start building rapport. If you find any kind of shields up, 
then you’ll use your Mind Bending Language to start luring them gently and 
invisibly. Then you can tell your stories about yourself or whatever and have 
them share stories of theirs too, just as part of the emotional thing so that 
you have that contact. That’s the first thing you do with rapport.  
 
 
The second thing you need to do with rapport is once you feel that their 
shields have gone down enough – not all the way, just enough – to start the 
process, I’d like for you to find a transition to naturally introduce the topic 
that you want to talk about, which is something you want to sell. 
 
 
If you want to be doing weight loss sessions, here’s an example of an 
unnatural transition when offering weight loss services. Unnaturally, meaning

not recommended. You’re a bit fat. Do you want to lose some weight? There 
are very few circumstances in which that will be a winner.  
 
 
So, how do you introduce that? That really depends on how the conversation 
flows. Some of you might just go for a non sequitur like it’s really interesting 
talking to you but can I just ask you a question? I’m really curious about this 
because I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. Then you go into what 
do you think about weight loss? Who do you think is interested in weight 
loss? This is one of my specialties. I’m always curious to find out what people 
think about it.  
 
 
Do you get the idea about this? Now that’s only one of many, many different 
ways of doing it. You might introduce it with a story. You know, I met a lady 
the other day and she said so and so. What do you think about that? So, you 
introduce it in the form of a story. I honestly don’t know how you’re going to 
do it. There are many different ways. Given the amount of time we have, we 
don’t have time to explore all of them.  
 
 
All I want you to do is use your creativity to go from rapport to some mind 
bending stuff to lower the shields, and then in whatever way you want to 
segue into opening the topic that you want to discuss, just throw it open. 
 
 
If you’re in a group that’s already meeting up – for example you’re in a 
support group of some sort – it’s real easy because they’re already there for 
it. If it’s at a dinner party, then you may need to do a little more work to 
frame it up so that people will be happy to talk about it and so on. Do you get 
the idea? 
 
 
So, put yourself mentally in that space. Tell them what kind of situation 
they’re in and then start. Just spend about five minutes having just a chit chat, 
but of course it’s not just chit chat because you’re trying to do those two 
things – shields down and then open the topic of conversation. 
 
 
Once you’ve done that, you can stop. Then we’ll bring you back and we’ll do 
the next step. Five minutes apiece. No more than that. Five minutes apiece, 
10 in total. Off you go. 
 
 
Was that interesting? Was that fun? That’s the first stage – the rapport stage. 
It’s relatively straightforward. Yes, there can always be more nuances and 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

things you can do. You can polish your rapport skills in many different ways, 
but right now we can take that as a unit. Is that correct? 
 
 
What’s the next step in your influencing formula? Remember, we’re going to 
kill problems. So you’re going to investigate.

-Need 
 
 
What skill are you going to be using whilst you’re investigating stuff? You’re 
going to use the skills you’ve been learning over the last five days really – the 
probing questions combined with Mind Bending Language to get deeper and 
deeper down the layer cake.  
 
 
At this point, you want to get specific with your probing questions. You’re 
trying to get some specific kind of information, and you can avoid other kinds 
of information because you’re not here to transform an entire life. You’re only 
interested in that process that will lead to a sale at the end. That makes sense, 
doesn’t it? 
 
 
So, the first thing I want you to investigate is if a need even exists in this 
person. Let me put it this way. The person may be overweight but has no 
desire to change whatsoever. They’re really happy. They like eating. They like 
cooking. They share a happy meal with their family.  
 
 
Why on Earth would they come see you as a weight loss specialist? There’s no 
need there. Why try to give them a complex to be able to solve it? That’s the 
unethical school of marketing, right? Let’s create a problem – look, I kicked 
your shins. Now that it’s broken, let’s put a plaster cast on it. 
 
 
That’s not what we’re doing here. So, investigate a genuine need. You’ll 
introduce the topic and talk to them. Ask them what do you think about it or 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
483 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
how do you feel about that, and see if your questions can lead towards 
discovering whether or not they have a need or a want.

3. Investigate 
 
 
 
-Motivation: Need/Want 
 
 
Do they need to lose some weight – maybe for health reasons, maybe for self-
esteem reasons – or do they want to lose some weight for similar reasons? 
It’s just a question of which way their emotions are tuned. Do you understand 
the nature of that?  
 
 
Now because you all have different interests in terms of the primary thing you 
want to sell here and the people in this room may or may not be your ideal 
clients anyway, we’ll need to role play this. Is that okay with you? 
 
 
So, do your best to quickly tell your partners when you start the exercise what 
kind of person they’re role playing. They’ll do their best to kind of play that 
role, just so you get a facility with this process.  
 
 
You’ll actually get good at this with real people. Here, you just want to get 
used to the process. Do you understand the distinction? Let’s only take about 
three minutes to discover a need or a want.  
 
 
We only need it enough to get just below the top few layers of the layer cake 
and then we’re good. Make sense to everyone? Are there any questions on 
that? We have more layers to investigate after this, so we’re just going to 
start the ball rolling with this one. Three minutes apiece, six in total, start 
now. 
 
 
Did you enjoy that? So, we got some motivation when we talk about needs 
and wants, do we not? There may be other motivations that they may have as 
well other than those inherent in what they need and what they want. There

484 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
may be other reasons going on, other things that feed into it, which you only 
find out doing the layer cake.

So really it’s a question of investigating their need and want further in some 
ways, or seeing if there are other purposes, other goals or other objectives 
that are related to this. Do you see where we’re going with this?  
 
 
Because it’s related to it, I’m going to skip over to the next bit as well, and 
you’re welcome to do some exploring around that if you want, but really it’s 
just a question of extending your search on needs and wants into a bigger 
domain of motivation, purpose and so on. Do you understand what I mean by 
that?

-Conclusions/Problem/Stuck 
 
 
So, the next thing we’re going to add onto that is we want to find out where is 
the problem? Where are they stuck? Now if their needs and wants really are 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
485 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
going to be sitting mostly in the motivation and purpose and so on – although 
of course you’ll find it in context, you’ll find it in conclusions and stuff like that 
as well – which of these six categories are you most likely to find information 
about where they’re stuck and where the problem is? 
 
 
 
Probing Questions: 
1. Motivation & Purpose 
2. Context, Frames & POV 
3. Driving Questions & Answers 
4. Concepts, Assumptions, Opinions, Thoughts, Facts 
5. Inferences & Conclusions 
6. Implications & Consequences 
 
 
Numbers four five and six? I’d agree with that. So, they’re kind of more spread 
out but four, five and six really have a lot of the juice in there, and in 
particular numbers four and five, and give is going to be the strongest of them 
all overall. 
 
 
It doesn’t mean you ignore the others. I’m just giving you some of my 
experiences, shall we say, and those people I’ve taught this to before who 
have been experimenting with this on real people – that’s where we tend to 
find the most juice in those things. This is just giving you a little heads up. 
That’s all. 
 
 
You realize of course it’s not just about conclusions. It’s about other things 
too. Does that make sense to you? Are there any questions on that? Three 
minutes apiece, carry on the conversation. Off you go. 
 
 
Did you enjoy that? A little note here – you’ll find their needs and wants in 
other places than just motivation. It’s just part of where motivation will be 
found. You can find other motivation outside of needs and wants too. I’m just 
giving you the most usual suspects, but please don’t get stuck on these 
categories. Is that a deal we can make?  
 
 
The same is true about how they get stuck and where the problem is. A great 
candidate for that is the conclusions they’ve drawn, the inferences they’ve 
made. However, there will be plenty of other places. It could be in their 
motivation that you’ll discover it. It could be in any of the other things that we 
discussed.

The next two topics under investigation are related to being in the problem 
and being stuck, and so I’m going to deal with them together because they’ll 
be kind of useful for that. The first one is what objections do they have to 
change, to have a better life?

-Objections 
 
 
Whether it’s a question of buying a toaster and they’re objecting to spending 
the money or getting a new one or the old one’s good even though every now 
and again it electrocutes people, not a big deal.  
 
 
What objections are kind of currently present within them? You don’t have to 
necessarily get them to state it out loud. They’ll often imply it for you and 
you’ll note it in the back of your mind so that you can handle it before they’ve 
actually consciously thought of it. 
 
 
For example, the money objection can be dealt with ahead of time often, and 
we’ll discuss that in brief detail in a moment. So, do you get the idea of finding 
objections and how it’s related to problems? 
 
 
The next one is important and it kind of fits all the investigation you’ve done 
so far, so it will be towards the tail end. The other four things we’ve done so 
far kind of happen simultaneously. They’ll be kind of going in different 
directions, and you’ll go in different cycles.  
 
 
The next one will be towards the end, only because you’ll need some 
information to start doing this – although sometimes it gets it handed to you

on a plate and you’ll be done within two seconds. Again, this is not a linear 
process. It’s just presented in a linear fashion to make it easy to practice.

-Objections 
 
 
 
-Demonstrate Value 
 
 
So, the next one is actually very important. You’ve got to demonstrate your 
value. You don’t talk about your value; you actually demonstrate it.  
 
 
 
Let me give you an example from one of our trainers who was in my study 
group to actually refine this process. He’s a relationship coach. Initially it takes 
a lot longer to go through these things to get information and so on, but think 
about it this way.  
 
 
He goes to meet-up groups with people who’ve had problem relationships 
who get to share how they haven’t managed to resolve their own issues, and 
of course they have a nice wonderful pity fest going on, and then he talks to 
them about stuff.  
 
 
How do you think they’ll feel about him if in talking about this stuff he 
presents some nugget of information or a little bit of transformation so that 
they see their relationships in different lights, so they have solutions to 
problems that they didn’t know how to resolve before?  
 
 
What do you think it’s going to do to him in terms of his status – increase it or 
decrease it? Increase it, right? That’s a leading question, by the way. So, by 
demonstrating value, he’s actually giving them a small experience of what it 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
488 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
actually means to have the product or service. It’s a free sample essentially, 
right? 
 
 
But it’s not just a sample in the hand; it’s the actual using of it. If you’re 
talking about a physical thing, instead of giving free samples of makeup, it’s 
actually having a makeup store in the store. You’ve seen that happen before, 
haven’t you? You get all nicely painted up and say great, how do I keep this? 
You buy the product.  
 
 
So, you give them a demonstration of value, and the easiest place for you to 
demonstration the value is by linking their needs and wants and motivations 
and the problems they’re stuck in and the objections in some way.  
 
 
Helping them overcome an objection is a demonstration of value. Helping 
them resolve some minor problem that they’re stuck in – something you can 
do in a minute or so – is a demonstration of value. Helping them have an 
experience of the feeling they’ll have when the need or want has been 
satisfied is a demonstration of value.  
 
 
You have a lot of choice here. In the interest of time, just play with that as a 
concept and realize that there are more things besides. Do you all understand 
the nature of these two things you’re doing here? 
 
 
So, go back to your conversations for three minutes apiece. Start at the point 
where you were with the problem being stuck and see if you can flush any 
objections out. If you can’t it’s not a big deal because it will usually come out 
in a bigger conversation anyway. 
 
 
Focus on either the objections or the problem they’ve got, or even if their 
needs and wants are irrelevant, but some way that you can give them an 
actual experience of value.  
 
 
Drop them down a layer in that layer cake where they actually get to 
experience the feeling of having achieved what they want, or they can resolve 
it or have some clarity that they didn’t have before in terms of the problem, 
or a reframe or an objection destroyer. 
 
 
An objection destroyer is a classic demonstration of value, isn’t it? Do you get 
the idea of where we’re going with this?

Student: In section three, there’s investigate. We are getting into selling here. When 
I’m dealing with objections and demonstrate value, it’s about the product or 
services I’m selling, so somewhere here I’m introducing that, and there seems 
to be gradually… 
 
Igor: 
It’s very gradual and you’re not actually selling at this point. Think of it this 
way. What if you’re just coaching them to give them a better experience at 
this point? Take the idea of selling out for a moment. If it helps you, by the 
way, keep thinking of it as selling but for a lot of people they have the idea 
that selling is saying this is what I do, please take my service, and that’s not 
what we’re talking about at all.  
 
 
We’re saying how can I serve you? You have a problem with this? Oh, let me 
ask you a few questions about that, and a few more, and a few more. Then 
you say do you have some insight now, and they’ll say oh my God, yes I do. 
 
 
Then the next step will show you how to link that to your product or service, 
but we’re not there yet. So, you’re not actually attempting to persuade them 
about anything in terms of what you can give them. You’re just going to give it 
to them as a gift.  
 
Student: The objections still show up at that stage.  
 
Igor: 
They may or may not. If they do, that’s great. Let’s say it’s a weight loss thing. 
Yeah, I’ve tried to lose weight. I’ve been on these really expensive programs. 
Half the time I can’t even afford them. I’m look at them and I really want 
them but I can’t afford it.  
 
 
Then they move onto another thought. They haven’t told you that they can’t 
afford your program, but they’ve told you that they’re very likely to say that if 
you actually offer it. Do you understand the distinction now? 
 
Student: Yes, perfect. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
So, I’m flushing out the objections before they commit to the objection. Do 
you understand the nuance? 
 
Student: I’ve got the nuance, yes.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you very much.

Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other questions? Three minutes apiece, let’s go. 
 
 
How did that go for you? Was that good? Was that relatively straightforward? 
Now please realize that each of these steps pretty much happen 
simultaneously.  
 
 
Rapport tends to precede investigating, but often just the fact that you start 
investigating stuff will increase the rapport and will lower the shields. So, 
they’re all kind of happening at the same time as you do these things. 
 
 
Secondly, at every step of the way creating a mind bending moment will give 
you a better quality of information, a better quality of experience, so you can 
use them throughout.  
 
 
In the demonstration of value, we talked about giving free samples away, but 
think of it in terms of the objection destroyer. What if you actually gave them 
a mind bending moment first, and then presented the free sample so that it 
meant more to them? Do you get the idea? 
 
 
What if the demonstration of value was the mind bending moment where 
they get to have the experience of thinking things through that are new, 
coming to a new opinion or conclusion and being very glad they did?  
 
 
Let’s put it this way. Let’s use the example of Devin again because he was nice 
and tall. Your kid plays basketball, right? Was that demonstration in terms of, 
just that Q&A session was it a relatively brief interaction? Do you think that 
was a demonstration of value for him? 
 
 
If I was offering him a coaching program let’s say to improve his life and his 
quality of thinking, his quality of teaching and so on, is he more likely or less 
likely to want to come to that program having experienced that? Do you see 
where I’m going with this? 
 
 
So, the demonstration of value may very well be a mind bending moment 
itself, but it could be other things too. Whatever you’re considering using for 
that in this exercise and actually going home, just think of more. Are you all 
good with the first three steps?

The fourth step is the final step in the process. Remember we are dealing with 
the basic influence formula. What’s the basic influence formula? The three 
letters are RIP.  
 
 
We’ve done the R and we’ve done the I. What does the P stand for? I call it 
the problem destroyer.

4. Problem Destroyer 
 
 
You can call it solver, I don’t care. To be honest with you, I made the word up, 
so it doesn’t really count, does it? Basically you’re going to solve or destroy 
the problem in one way or another. 
 
 
Who would like to know what would be a very useful way to use a problem 
destroyer to actually close a sale? You know what’s coming, don’t you? Be 
back on time after lunch. 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How was lunch? Did you enjoy this process you’ve been going 
through so far? Let’s just have any quick questions or comments you have on 
this before we finish this process up. Now would be a good time to elucidate 
anything. Go ahead.

Student: What I found is that the person that was questioning, as he was questioning 
me I kind of knew the questions he should have asked for me to get to the 
answer. 
 
Igor: 
That’s very useful, right? The key here– and we’ll talk about this more when 
we get into the method again – is don’t concern yourself about how fast you 
can do it right now. You’re getting experience and practice. There will be ways 
to shortcut it in time, and that’s what we’ll talk about when we finish this. It’s 
great to have the instincts where you kind of know where to go with this now. 
 
Student: Yes, he was asking the questions and I’m going okay but if you would ask me 
this, I would really buy it. 
 
Igor: 
The nice thing is you have those instincts. You’re starting to learn about what 
makes that process work. Hopefully you shared that with your partner too. 
 
Student: I will afterwards. I just didn’t want to upset him. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fair enough. It’s a great learning for both of you. That’s how the 
exercises work. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. Is there anyone else?  
 
Student: Just to build on what she just said, I was wondering if you could just simply 
ask the person. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, that’s really the usual way to find things out, right?  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
It’s just another probing question at that point, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is there anyone else? 
 
Student: Could you point out then what they could possibly lose or lose more of if they 
did not gain or receive your product? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. So really what you’re describing here – and this is why we’re doing this 
right at the end – that’s an example of a choice multiplier but really it’s kind of 
a choice multiplier about possible unintended consequences of their actions.

Of course we’re not doing evil hypnosis. We don’t want to leave them there. 
This is more about informing them. The key is are you advice-giving, which 
happens when they’re still looping around those logical sets, which is when 
it’s easily rejected; or are you having more of a mentoring or coaching role, 
which happens when you pop down lower in that layer cake. 
 
 
Basically, if you give advice as the reframe in the objection destroyer, that’s 
where advice belongs. If you think of the objection destroyer as an advice-
giver, it works exactly the same way.  
 
 
It’s just you change the reframe to the advice you want to give – or in that 
case, the reframe you want to give. That gives you a lot of choices, a lot of 
varieties, whilst still giving you some structure. Are there any other comments 
or questions on that? 
 
 
In that case, we have some finishing to do, don’t we?  
 
Problem Destroyer Phase 
 
Igor: 
So now I want to go into the idea of the problem destroyer phase. The 
problem destroyer here in terms of the sales process – this is really where 
you’re going to put things together for them. 
 
 
 
They may or may not know that they have a problem. If you’ve done your 
investigation phase properly, then they will know they have a problem, and 
now that you’ve given them the problem you can take it away again. 
 
 
Of course remember, the ethics here is you don’t give them the problem that 
is artificial. If there’s a problem they’re just not aware of – which is going back 
to Arthur’s question, to use the medical example. Let’s say that have a skin 
condition that could become cancerous. They don’t know about that, right? 
 
 
So, part of your investigation phase will be to inform them about that. Hence, 
you’re not creating a problem. You’re just making them aware of the problem 
that’s actually there, so they can appreciate it for the importance of it. Does 
that make sense?

-Link Motivation To Your Offer 
 
 
Now what we want to do is link the motivation that you’ve already uncovered 
to your product or your service. In other words, the only possible reason that 
you might have to offer a product or a service to a person in need like they 
are, is because it will somehow resolve all or a part of that problem, or in 
terms of an aspiration it will actually help them fulfill all or a part of that 
aspiration. 
 
 
For example, all of you came here with an aspiration in terms of becoming 
influential and learning Mind Bending Language. Some of you – maybe most 
of you – came here in order to resolve a problem.  
 
 
In other words, you have a specific context in mind in which you want to be 
more influential – be that therapy, sales or whatever – so you’re here for both 
reasons. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
So, you want to link their motivation, their reason for interacting with this 
problem or aspiration, to what you have to offer. A useful tool – not the only 
way to do this, I’m just going to give this to you as a starting point – is to use 
that process you learned doing the emotional reframe. 
 
 
Remember, strong emotions and let them start making up choices or ideas 
and stuff about that. When you’re linking their motivation, just remind them 
when you felt that sort of pain or whatever it is, one are the first things we 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
495 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
addressed in this coaching program is how to manage that emotion so that it 
doesn’t have to disturb you anymore, for example.

Or, with winter tires, now you can actually be a careful driver and your car will 
actually drive the way it’s supposed to on the snow. So, you’re actually linking 
their motivation back to what you have to offer. Do you understand that 
process? 
 
 
Let’s just take two minutes apiece. This doesn’t take very long. Get with your 
partners and start doing that now. Pick up from where you left off. Those of 
you, who’ve got a new partner, just give them a 10-second summary of where 
they’re supposed to be, because they’re only role playing this anyways. Then 
just jump back into it. Two minutes apiece, off you go. 
 
 
Was that easy to do? It’s pretty straightforward, right? Now of course we’re 
still going through this relatively mechanically to get the steps right. In time 
you can see how naturally linking the motivation to what you’re doing fits 
actually into the investigation phase also.  
 
 
These are rounds. You can do them in layers as you go along, and that’s when 
it becomes very natural and conversational. The next step is once the 
motivation is linked to your product, you also have to make it easy for them 
to actually do it.

Let me put it this way to you. Who here loves the idea of ethically earning a 
million dollars in the next three weeks? Go ahead and do it. There’s 
something missing, isn’t there. There’s a plan missing, some steps, some 
sequences.  
 
 
One of the big barriers to people doing things is that too much is demanded 
of them. I don’t know where to begin. I don’t know how to do this. To help 
them do that, you’re going to give them a future memory where you walk 
them through what’s going to happen.

You’ll say here’s how the coaching program works. You’ll sign up and we’ll talk 
about this first. Then this will happen, and the next thing you know you’ll feel 
this way and will resolve these things. Before you know it, this other stuff is 
going to happen on top of it. 
 
 
Do you see the kind of stuff we’re talking about? Really paint a vivid picture to 
them. This is where the gentleman with the fire extinguisher – that’s a future 
memory, isn’t it? Really walk them through the solution. 
 
 
We’re no longer wanting to create all that much pain. Of course if in they 
need more motivation, you can always give them a future memory of not

497 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
doing it and compare that to the future memory of doing it, but that’s going 
back to the idea of motivation again. 
 
 
Do you see how these things are all interlinked? One of the patterns that 
you’ve learned in terms of Mind Bending Language that will fit nicely in here is 
the choice multiplier.

Another thing that will fit in here very nicely in terms of your questioning skills 
– and I got this from Joe over here – is the idea of changing points of view. 
This is what you’ll be getting, this is how you’ll be feeling, this is what you’ll be 
experiencing and so on. 
 
 
Now think what that will mean for your business. How are your clients going 
to perceive you next? How much more excited are they going to be to be 
there for you? Think about your wife, your husband, your kids, your 
colleagues, your peers.  
 
 
By switching through these points of view, they get an even richer version of 
the future memory. Do you get the idea of that? I think we’ll just leave it at 
that for now.

It’s very easy to go from linking the motivation straight into the future 
memory and blending the two together. We’re just separating them out to 
you right now so that you understand that there’s a distinction in terms of 
what you’re trying to achieve. Does all that make sense? Are there any 
questions on that? All right, two minutes apiece with the same partners. Off 
you go. 
 
 
How was that? Was that straightforward? Now I realize it’s a lot of fun to get 
involved in this so you can get really engaged and all the rest of it. Again, 
we’re not here to complete this process and get it perfected. You’re in 
training. The point is for you to understand this well enough that you can go 
home and perfect it with the actual people you need to be influencing, 
particularly in the sales process.

-Call To Action!!! NOW!!!! 
 
 
There’s one last piece to deal with the problem destroyer phase here. This is 
possibility the most important thing you’ll ever do and the one thing that 
most people forget about. It’s called the call to action. The time to call them 
to action isn’t about five years’ time when they maybe possibly feel like it. 
There’s only one moment when you can take action and that’s in the present 
moment.

If you’ve done your job right going throughout all those four steps and all the 
little nuances inside of them, half the time before you even get to finish the 
fourth point, people are already asking you; how do I do it? How do I buy? 
What do I do? 
 
 
Then my future memory actually tells them to sign on the dotted line and 
then here’s what’s going to happen next. Actually that would be technically 
the call to action for some people, but that’s only if they’ve already asked for 
it.  
 
 
If they haven’t at the end of this whole process, you can just look at them and 
say what do you think? Does that sound like something you’d like too? I mean 
it’s not exactly a high pressure sale, is it? But if you’ve done your job correctly, 
they will jump at that chance. 
 
 
Even those few that say well I’ve got to think about it, then you go right back 
to the objection destroyer and of course that’s one of the common objections 
you’ve already dealt with. It doesn’t matter. If they’re going to go home and 
think about it, it’s not a big deal. Let them.  
 
 
Some people need that. That’s part of their process. Just make sure that your 
future memory includes elements of being motivated and excited, so the 
more they think about it the more they think about you. The more they think 
about you the more they’ll envision that future memory of resolution and 
stuff like that.  
 
 
Very importantly, exchange contact details. Unless you have incredibly 
powerful psychic vibes, it will be very difficult for you to contact them again 
and say how about it now? Do you understand what I mean by that? So, you 
don’t necessarily have to practice a call to action. It’s just like hey do you 
fancy doing that now?

Igor: 
What I’d like to do instead is, with this whole process in mind, I’d like you to 
comment on your experiences here, what you’ve learned, what you’ve taken 
from it, and also if you have any questions you have about 10 minutes left to 
ask them.

Student: The most common objection I received, I don’t have an answer for yet but 
two people gave me ‘I don’t believe you’ and one person I got a sensation. As 
far as I know I’m telling the truth, so I’m wondering about handling that 
objection. 
 
Igor: 
Here’s the thing. First of all if they tell you I don’t believe you it’s either 
because you don’t have rapport, you haven’t built up credibility that way, or 
they just haven’t got an experience. What is it you’re selling? 
 
Student: The first time it was the one session weight loss hypnotherapy. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. In that case, if you want to role play a little bit, I don’t believe you. 
You can say I understand because there are lots of things you’ve done before 
that haven’t worked. Isn’t that right?  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
You’ve either tried things or you haven’t. 
 
Student: I’m the customer? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Have you tried things before or not? 
 
Student: Yes, I have tried a number of things that didn’t work. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Excellent. And how well have those worked? 
 
Student: Well, I gained more weight than I lost. 
 
Igor: 
That’s right, and do you know why you gained more weight? Would you like 
to know the secret to dieting and why that doesn’t work? Here’s why. When 
you go on a diet, you’re telling your mind there is not enough food, and your 
mind has been programmed for millions of years to survive.  
 
 
So, when there’s not enough food around, what do you think is the most 
sensible thing for a mammal to do to survive? Whenever some little morsel 
comes along, it’s going to stuff it right in to keep the fat there so you can use 
it and stay alive longer.

501 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, to the extent that you have tried to diet in the past, I’m not surprised 
you’ve gained weight. Now when you go right to where the root of the 
problem is, which is in your unconscious, instead of telling it that there is 
actually going to be more famine, you tell it there’s so much food that you 
don’t it anymore. That’s when it all comes off. That makes sense, doesn’t it? 
 
Student: That does sound interesting.  
 
Igor: 
So, here’s how this program works. Yada, yada, yada. Does that help? 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. Is there anyone else? Go ahead. 
 
Student: Yes, basically before lunch my partner and I found that we must have been 
running ahead of the game because we’re finding that many of the objections 
that we have written, we didn’t fulfill them all but we had gone through and 
we’d actually reached, which surprised both of us. 
 
 
Our scenario was we were sitting in the plane traveling back to Europe and 
got discussing things. I used the emotional reframe by telling him that 
because it was a case of using Mind Bending Language, and consequently I 
sold the idea that it would not only help him at work, it would help him 
outside in his social life, especially if they have children, etc., which means 
what we learned from Neil, at the front there, I believe it was, on that one. 
 
Igor: 
Great job. Well done. Really I’m not surprised that you jumped the gun ahead 
of time because you already have all the skills. All the tools you need to put it 
together into the sales method are already there. I’ve just pulled them 
together into a particular method so that you can use them. 
 
 
Actually, we’ll talk about how that process becomes a 5 to 10-minute process 
in a moment because that’s the next step. Right now we’re still in a longer 
process. Thank you for that. Are there any other comments or questions? Go 
ahead. 
 
Student: I was just wondering about the objections that he came up with – well, I want 
to talk it over with my wife or I want to think about it a bit longer. I’m 
wondering what you think if I say how do you feel about it right now? Maybe 
we could go from that point.

Igor: 
May I develop your thought a little. I see where you’re going with this and I’ve 
seen this very successfully done. Just play the client for a minute if you would. 
So, let me just check. You need to talk this over with your wife. Is that right? 
 
Student: Yes, I do. 
 
Igor: 
I totally understand that. Now from your point of view, have you heard 
everything you need to, to know whether or not this is something you’re 
interested in? 
 
Student: Yes, I’m interested in it. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, really it’s just a question of being respectful enough to your wife 
so that you can both commit to this. Is that right? 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, here’s what we’ll do if you like. If you want, I’ll reserve the place 
right now and we’ll just sign all the paperwork now. You can go home and 
discuss it with your life and if there should be any problem with that – I 
understand it’s entirely you free choice – I’ll tear of the paperwork and 
nothing’s happened.  
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with that? I’ve actually seen a more hard line 
version of that done, which I don’t like very much, along the lines of do you 
need to get your wife’s permission? Is she your mama? Anything where the 
words your mama come in is not a good thing, right? Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is there anything else? 
 
Student: I’m just wondering in a situation like that, would it be advisable to ask what 
would she need to know? 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, it would be. We haven’t completed the cycle. Now we go back 
into the investigation. So, yes absolutely. This is an involved process and 
you’ve probably spent half an hour talking to people, and even then there’s 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
503 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
probably more stuff you can unearth using these processes. Would that be 
fair to say? 
 
 
So, spending an hour or so per conversation is not unrealistic. In fact when I 
was doing executive coaching, that’s exactly what would happen. I was 
useless in marketing. I had no business method to speak of to start with, but 
the one thing I did have is the insight to have a one-hour free coaching 
consultation with potential clients.  
 
 
Let’s face it, a six-month program starting at $2,000 a day is not a bad thing. 
So, I had a free one-hour consultation and I’d do these sorts of things with 
them, not quite as refined as this but pretty much these sorts of things. Of 
course in the process I’d find out what their motivations are, what their 
problems are, their sticking points and so on and I’d link it back and we’d talk 
about it. At the end of that hour, I’d usually – nine times out of 10 – sign up 
the client.  
 
 
It’s an hour and it’s worth investing that hour. However, I’ve called this the 
five-minute sales process. How can I have the gumption to do that when 
there’s an extra 55 minutes attached at the end? Would you like to know how 
you turn this into a five- to 10-minute process? 
 
 
It will require effort on your part. All that you have to do is be willing to invest 
that hour-long conversation with enough potential clients to thoroughly 
understand their mindset.  
 
 
There’s a guarantee I will make you. Each group of clients, every niche that 
you’re in, every service or product that you have has an ideal group of clients 
that you’re interested in, and that group of clients will all share similarities, 
similar mindsets.  
 
 
There will probably be three to five common objections that they all share. 
Every now and again you’ll get something different from someone on the 
edges, but they’ll really have the same sort of things.  
 
 
You’ll have three to five motivators and purposes that drive them. You’ll have 
some very common experiences. So, with the executive coaching for example, 
after a few years of doing this I could literally walk into the meeting and ask 
them a few questions in the rapport phase – like how’s it going, nice talking to 
you, how come you’re interested in coaching? 

Mind Bending Language Mastery & Covert Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
504 MBL Mastery & Covert Hypnosis    ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
As soon as we started opening that door up, I’d be testing straightaway for 
what’s the motivation? I know it’s going to be one of five things, so I’ll just 
check. Oh, here we go, these are the two. 
 
 
Then it’s the same with the problems and the objections. Is it going to be this 
one, this one or this one? There we go. That’s the one. Then I’ll have the 
reframe straight into it. The same is true with the problems and the 
stuckness. 
 
 
I just list them through. Sometimes I literally just list through you’re either 
having this, this or this. I’m observing behavior – that’s the one, isn’t it? That’s 
the one you’ve got. They’ll say how did you know? I just have a gift 
sometimes. Not really, but sometimes. 
 
 
The point is you can collapse a 60-minute conversation into five to 10 minutes 
when you do that. Now it does require some eloquence. It does require your 
ability to drop them into that layer cake very quickly and that requires some 
skill, which means some more practice. However, it’s not outside of your 
realm of your skills right now. All you need is to do this enough at length to 
know what the five, six or 10 common things are, depending on the 
circumstances.  
 
 
For those of you for example who have the Master Class on the Stop Smoking 
Method, that’s why it works so well. I spent the earlier part of my stop 
smoking career actually doing the first session as just a long interview, just 
talking to them about when they smoke, how they smoke, why they smoke, 
where the smoke, whether they’ve tried to quit and I got it all. 
 
 
The form you have inside of that is basically the complete blueprint of the 
mind of a smoker. Just by going through that checklist, you’ll say okay one, 
two, three – no, no, no – one, two, three. You have a perfect profile for their 
smoking behavior, and then the whole method will just adapt straight into it. 
 
 
That works for every single situation that I know of. If it ever breaks down, it’s 
only because you have a separate group of people now becoming interesting, 
and then you repeat that cycle with the new group because you can identify 
where you think there’s a problem.

It could be an age thing. It could be a location thing. It could be a niche thing. 
It could be a product thing. Who knows? Do you understand how that works? 
Do you have any questions about that whole process and, more importantly, 
how to turn them into five- to 10-minute sales cycle? 
 
Student: So, after it becomes unconscious, so after you have the unconscious, you kind 
of make a game plan, right? Is that what you’re trying to put. The form is kind 
of like a game plan, so you don’t have to spend as much time and it’s more 
efficient, right? 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. It still sounds like a regular conversation to them – like hey that’s 
an interesting talk. How come you came? You’re listening out. It’s like oh you 
know what, it’s interesting, I spoke to this chap over here and he said he came 
for that. Are you like that or are you more like this kind of person? 
 
 
You can literally quickly steer the conversation down the path where you’ll 
find out what are the motivators, where are they stuck, what are their 
objections? That literally takes five to 10 minutes if you’ve got the people 
skills backing it up to get to it. 
 
Student: But it’s just all through experience. Just keep going. 
 
Igor: 
It’s through experience. It sounds strange but what happens is you have this 
blueprint popping up in the back of your mind. You don’t really think about it. 
 
Student: It’s just unconscious. 
 
Igor: 
You just have your chat and you’re literally just steering the conversation. You 
say oh, got it, got it, got it and you’re not really thinking about it. You know 
when you play a videogame and you’ve got to go through these zones to pick 
up points. It’s like you go yes here’s one star, okay here’s another star, oh I 
missed that one but I’ll come back to that later. Then literally it’s like really a 
game at that point. You’re just having an interesting conversation with 
someone, and all the right points have lit up. 
 
 
As soon as you have enough of those points lit up inside your mind – or at 
least that’s what I do – I get a feeling that says all right, it’s time to link it all 
together and paint them a picture.  
 
Student: Awesome. Thank you.

Igor: 
It sounds devilishly simple and it is, but you have to do the work first to get 
there. Is there anything else? Great, in that case it looks like I’ve done my job 
well. We’re not finished yet. There is one last thing I want you to experience 
before we finish today. 
 
 
All of you came here for a specific purpose. In other words, you had at least 
one situation in mind where you want to be influential. Is that not right? It 
may be to do the sales cycle, in which case you’ve got it already, but chances 
are there are other things that you also want to deal with – helping your 
teenage kids or your non-teenage kids or teenagers that aren’t your kids or 
just kids. Who knows? 
 
 
Maybe you want to upwardly manage your boss, whether it’s to get a raise or 
to change living conditions in the work environment, or to adopt a project, or 
to influence colleagues to support your project over another project, or to 
work with clients and steer them down the path of something that will be 
better for them and so on. 
 
 
It doesn’t matter what it is, but you all have a situation in mind where you’d 
like to be influential, do you not? What I would like you to do is just spend 10 
minutes – nothing more than that, it really doesn’t take very long – with a 
partner. We’ll set you up with a partner in a minute. 
 
 
All you’re going to do is tell them about that situation. Your job as the 
questioner is to ask them about that situation with the purpose of helping 
them discover a game plan – you know what, here’s what I want to try. Here’s 
another thing I want to try. You know what, I’m going to go home and do this 
thing. 
 
 
So, things like the choice multiplier and so on would probably be relevant. Do 
you understand the nature of the exercise? It’s not very long. It doesn’t have 
to be very long.  
 
 
As the questioner, you’re just going to help them to clarify – remember clarity 
and precision – how they are going to use all the skills you’ve learned over the 
last five days in that situation specifically. Then they’ll return the compliment. 
Easy to do?

Welcome back. How did that go? Did you enjoy that? Who here now feels 
they can go home and not only have a great sales process, but actually just be 
much more influential in the places you want to be?  
 
 
Remember those of you who signed up for the email list with each other, if 
you need another pep talk, just call a friend. It’s going to be there for you. The 
thing that I’m most excited by is the idea that we have over 100 or maybe 200 
mind bending hypnotists out there doing good work now, not just for 
hypnotherapy but actually just out there spreading some love and kindness in 
the world and doing some good things.  
 
 
Was it Mrs. Doubtfire that had the run-by fruiting? You’ll be doing some run-
by bending and the whole world will be a better place for it. First of all I think 
you all deserve a great round of applause for the stuff that you’ve done.  
 
 
I was just talking to our training staff during the break. I’m really impressed 
with how far you’ve come over the last five days. This has been a bit of an 
experimental seminar as far as I’m concerned because we’ve really been 
pushing the envelope out to where I wanted you to go.  
 
 
This is not a usual sort of them for a large group to be able to do this stuff, 
and I really want to thank all of you for being willing to take part in that 
process, for being part of that process, and willing to stick with it because I 
know at times it’s not been easy. 
 
 
Each one of you has been challenged at times. I know that pretty much 
everyone in the room at some point thought yeah maybe I shouldn’t come 
back tomorrow because my head hurts. So, thank you for sticking through it 
and doing it.  
 
 
 
Hopefully the skills that you have acquired now, looking back over the last five 
days have been worth every moment you’ve put into it. Would that be fair to 
say?

You have 10 keys to something or other that really drive the whole process, 
that make it work for you. All this stuff is actually pretty straightforward now, 
isn’t it?  
 
 
 
3 Questions: 
1. Psychologically Leading 
2. Logically Leading 
3. Intuitively Leading 
 
 
You also understand the importance of the kinds of questions you’re asking – 
the leading questions, the psychologically leading, the logically leading, and 
the intuitively leading. 
 
 
Each of which has a different impact. Some are faster than others. Some have 
a deeper impact than others and by mixing them up, you have the ultimate 
balancing point of the influence you want to have. 
 
 
 
MBL Power Words/ Predicates: 
1. SPACE – Beyond, Aside, Inside, Over, Under, Anywhere, Through, 
Here, On Top Of, All Over, Next To, In Place Of, Beside 
2. TIME – Now, Later, Then, Before, After, Forever, Anytime, Never, 
Once Upon A Time, During, Soon Eternally 
3. ENERGY -  Totally, To The Extent, Absolutely, Completely, Anyway, 
Subtly, Partially, In Connection To, Relative To, Lik, Only, Barely 
4. MATTER – Each, All That, This, Other, Many, Next, Few, Everything, 
Only, What Else, Except, Any, One 
 
 
On top of that, you have mind bending power words and predicates and so 
on. Isn’t that pretty straightforward at this point? You still have resources of 
course to help further with this, but this is where we started from and it 
seemed so complex on the first day, and now it’s like yeah it’s kind of child’s 
play at this point.  
 
 
 
RIP Formula: 
 
 
Rapport 
 
 
Investigate 
 
 
Problem Destroyer

I’m really interested in that RIP formula – Rapport, Investigate and Problem 
Destroyers. Notice how simple that’s become for you now and you have a lot 
of experience in backing that stuff up. 
 
 
Really, what it comes down to here are five simple things you can look out for, 
which happen usually in natural conversations. You of course have all the 
other tools to invent more problem destroyers for yourself, but you have four 
very useful ones that will commonly be popping up anyways. 
 
 
 
Problem Destroyers: 
1. Choice Multiplier 
2. Contradiction Blowout 
3. Emotional Reframe 
 
-Check 
 
-Acknowledge/Intensity 
 
-Reframe 
 
 
4. Objection Destroyer 
 
 
 
-MBL Probe 
 
 
 
-Reframe 
 
 
5. 5 Minute Sales Method 
 
 
That fifth one – the 5 minute sales method –you understand the most 
common objections you’re likely to get.  
 
 
 
5 Most Common Objections: 
1. I Don’t Have Enough… Money, Time Etc. 
2. Something’s Blocking Me… 
3. Dabbler 
4. I need X Before I Can Have Y 
5. I Don’t Believe You 
 
 
And all this stuff you did today, and if I might say so you did it very, very well.  
 
 
 
The 5 Minute Sales Method: 
1. Background 
 
-Find Genuine Value In What You Do 
 
-Identify Genuine Need 
 
-Construct An Irresistible Offer 
 
 
2. Rapport

-Conclusions/Problem/Stuck 
 
 
 
-Objections

4. Problem Destroyer 
 
 
 
-Link Motivation – Emotional Reframe 
 
 
 
-Future Memory – Choice Multiplier, POV 
 
 
 
-Call To Action!!! NOW!!!! 
 
 
5. Five Minute Sales Process 
 
 
So, who feels like they’ve learned something now? I think you deserve one 
more round of applause because that is a lot of material to get through. At 
this stage of the training, what normally remains is just for me to thank 
people. I thanked you. 
 
 
The next people I want to thank are in the back of the room. We have Megan 
and Robin, who are our support staff. We’ve got the absent Cliff who 
magically made all this happen, so we’ll have to thank him as well because 
without him this wouldn’t have occurred. 
 
 
We have our assistants who of course made all this very smooth and natural 
and really behind the scenes made sure things happened, so thank you guys 
for that.  
 
 
Thank you all for coming because you spent five days being here and I’ve 
really enjoyed that. Thank you.
