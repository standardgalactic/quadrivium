development channels, what‚Äôs new in Node 9 and

incredible selection of industry gurus. So
where can you get to see this fine array of

2018 sees not one, but two Generate

kicks-off in the city that never sleeps, New
York City. To be precise the conference will
reside at the glorious Metropolitan Pavilion

So what‚Äôs happening? The 25th April is
Workshops day with four separate
workshops dedicated to Modern Frontend
Performance Strategies and Techniques;
Information Architecture for Everybody;
Essential Web Animation Techniques; and
An Intro to ReactJS. Then it‚Äôs on to
Thursday and Friday where you can get to
see the speakers in action. The first day
kicks off with Story First: Crafting Products
That Engage by Donna Lichaw. The
morning session continues with How I Cut
My Working Hours In Half And Somehow
Managed to Get More Done by developer
Jason Lengstorf; Choose Your Animation
Adventure by Val Head; and What‚Äôs New In
JavaScript? by Wes Bos.
After lunch it‚Äôs How To Make Sense Of
Any Mess by Abby Covert; Using CSS Grid
In The Real World by front-end developer
Brenda Storer; and Dan Mall finishing the
day off with his Should Designers‚Ä¶? talk.
Then it‚Äôs on to the after-party ‚Äì the perfect

to the conference speakers.
Onto the Friday and the day begins with

Opinion
hanks to the rise of mobile and digital assistants ‚Äì such as Apple‚Äôs Siri, Microsoft 
Cortana, Amazon‚Äôs Alexa, and Google ‚Äì voice-activated searches and commands 
have become more mainstream. And since more people are using voice search, 
it‚Äôs directly affecting how they search, and how businesses need to adapt their 
websites and digital marketing to stay on top of these ranking opportunities.
According to comScore, 50 per cent of all searches will be voice searches by 2020 ‚Äì 
a major reason for this growth is convenience and ease of use. But there is far more to 
voice search than convenience and the ability to multi-task, it‚Äôs changing the way search 
engines handle search queries and how users search for the information they need.
Voice search is uniquely tied to real-time, in particular local searches, with longer tail 
natural language searches typically reflecting immediate needs with stronger intent. 
This is an exciting opportunity for businesses and marketers to increase conversion and 
stay on top of this evolving niche. So how can you stay on top of the rankings?
If you want your website to be found, it needs to be mobile friendly. Your focus 
should therefore be on creating mobile-friendly pages, with content that loads quickly. 
Use the free Google Test My Site tool (bit.ly/2aAXzOV) to see how easily a visitor can 
use your website on a mobile device. People also read mobile content differently than 
they do with desktop content, bear this in mind when creating your content and design.
Amend your keyword targeting, in favour of longer tail keywords and be conscious 
of ‚Äòthe why‚Äô behind what users are searching for. This is because people talk differently 
than they type, consider how you would speak naturally and search for things verbally 
via voice search. Inevitably these will be longer keyword phrases, for example ‚ÄòWhat is 
the best Italian restaurant near Bournemouth station?‚Äô
In line with longer tail keyword targeting, add an FAQ resource to your site. This will 
include dedicated landing pages, filled with content that list the questions and answers 
your audience has ‚Äì who, what, when, where and why queries ‚Äì as well as being 
optimised with keywords and metadata for search engine optimisation. Ultimately, you 
need to provide value to your users as well as the search engines.
Make the most of advanced SEO techniques, such as Schema data markup, since this
will enable you to comprehensively describe what the data on your site means. Add this
to your HTML and improve the way your pages are represented in SERPs. This will
ultimately boost your visibility since the search engines will find it easier to understand
who you are and what you do. For example: Structured data can be used to mark up all
kinds of items from products to events to recipes. The following URL will help you
understand the basics and how to implement it across your website: developers.
google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data.
Most people use voice search to get information about physical places they want to
visit, voice search can recognise ‚Äònear me‚Äô searches and turn to the Google My Business
listings to populate these results. Utilising local listings can therefore increase your
chances of appearing. Make sure your Google My Business account is up to date and
select all the relevant categories. Take advantage of other local listing directories, in
particular the free ones, to increase your search engine real estate and opportunity.
Start by visiting google.co.uk/intl/en/business/.
Also take advantage of localised paid placements, such as Google‚Äôs Ad Words. For
example, location extensions will enable your business address, phone number, and
directions to be displayed alongside your adverts. This is crucially important if you want
to show up in the strongly commercial ‚Äònear me‚Äô searches. Google Maps Local Search
adverts will also help you reach the right people, at the right time.

GOODBYE TO 
UX DESIGNERS
As the web evolves so do job roles. Current roles will disappear and new appear.  
Here are five jobs that look set to be part of the design future
FULL-STACK DESIGNER
Similar to full-stack web developers 
who code for both front- and back-end 
technologies, full-stack designers will 
have skills in multiple design 
disciplines. The emergence of this role is already 
motivated by employers needing to become more 
efficient with their budgets ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs to be 
‚Äòprice competitive‚Äô, or public sector organisations 
responding to the government‚Äôs austerity cuts. 
Full-stack developers will offer better value to 
employers by allowing for smaller team 
requirements and less downtime due to more 
flexibility to deploy skills.
INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGNER
A combination of graphic and UX 
design, but with a primary focus on 
delivering content for learning. This 
type of design is applied to all forms of 
digital media from web pages to ebooks and apps. 
The obvious role for instructional designers is in 
supporting education organisations such as 
universities for creating custom content for their 
courses. Additional demand for instructional 
design is likely to emerge as more businesses 
embrace technology such as self service 
supermarket checkouts ‚Äì hence needing content to 
instruct their customers.
SCIENTIFIC DESIGNER
They say knowledge is power ‚Äì whether 
that‚Äôs for PR communications, making 
business decisions or helping people to 
live a healthy lifestyle. The rise of 
digital technology and the Internet has allowed 
more data than ever before to be captured.
The problem with data is that it‚Äôs just data. While 
some have no problem making ‚Äòsense‚Äô of data 
through statistical analysis techniques, the average 
person can only see ‚Äònonsense‚Äô. This is where the 
role of scientific designer emerges ‚Äì to present 
knowledge from data as easy-to-understand visuals.
AR/VR DESIGNER
The emergence of 
smartphones and 
the revival of AR/VR 
headset technology 
(see Microsoft Hololens and 
Oculus Rift) at an affordable 
price means that the 
mainstream public now have 
access to content using these 
abilities. Programmes for 
marketing, education and other 
activities have an opportunity 
to benefit from this medium 
through providing memorable 
experiences that engage their 
audiences. A medium is only 
useful if content is available to 
grow its potential ‚Äì hence the 
role of AR/VR design as a 
specific design specialism.
INTELLIGENT
CONTENT AUTHOR
The opposite of a 
scientific designer, 
an intelligent 
content author will 
produce content that either 
captures or reacts to data. This 
type of designer will evolve 
from UX design to embrace AI 
to allow content to adapt itself 
to what it knows about users.
Data will come from multiple 
sources, including popular 
digital assistant technologies 
such as Alexa, Siri and Google 
Assistant. Design content will 
be hosted as either 
independent content or as part 
of an external platform such as 
with chatbots for Facebook‚Äôs 
Messenger service.

Our interest in web-based AR is driven by our desire

become one of the most important features of our 
toolkit; a doorway to contextual information about
where I am and what I can see at that moment.

Creative heavyweight Tobias van Schneider reveals five 
essential tips to take your designs to the next level
How to become
DESIGN 
ROYALTY
1. 
FORGET THE IDEA OF 
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS
We love to celebrate success stories and put 
people we admire on a pedestal. But we 
forget even the most successful people had 
to start somewhere and worked hard to get 
where they are today. There is no such thing 
as an overnight success.
2. 
REMEMBER A SIDE PROJECT 
CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE
Look at every task or project that comes 
your way, even the seemingly small and 
insignificant ones, as an opportunity. You 
never know where an article you write, a 
video you make or a design you create 
might take you. Say yes until you can afford 
to say no.
3. 
BE STUPID
The greatest ideas never make it into 
the world because we‚Äôre too afraid of what 
other people think. We fear failure and 
come up with excuses. We overcomplicate 
and our idea dies before we‚Äôve even begun. 
Keep it simple, be stupid.
4. 
TRUST YOUR GUT
With all the information in the world at 
our fingertips, we can easily talk ourselves 
in circles. Information often fails us, but 
intuition almost never does. Your intuition 
is the sum of your experiences, learnings 
and a little magic. Do what feels right.
5. 
DON‚ÄôT DO IT FOR MONEY
Of course we need money to live, but 
it shouldn‚Äôt be our main motivator. Aim to 
make what you need to get by. This will 
open up opportunities and relationships 
you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise consider, and work 
that actually excites you. Money usually 
ruins the fun, but fun brings the money.

15 POWER TIPS FOR TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM
GET LOCAL
If you are only going to do 
one thing with social media 
from now on then it should 
be this. Join as many local 
community groups as 
possible and post regularly 
in them. Get known, 
provide advice, answer 
questions. Just participate.  
People buy from people 
they know. So make sure 
everyone knows you.
MEMES
People love to share 
funny pictures. The 
picture itself isn‚Äôt going 
to get you any business, 
but becoming known as 
a person who is funny 
isn‚Äôt going to do you any 
harm at all. Social media 
is about interaction. Be 
the person that everyone 
likes. Try to make what 
you share relevant‚Ä¶
KNOW YOUR 
AUDIENCE
Every single Facebook tip 
boils down to one thing. Get 
to know the people around 
you, and make sure they know 
you. Talk to people, answer 
their questions for free, be the 
guy everyone likes, the first 
person they think of. Then 
when they need something, 
you‚Äôll have already sold it.
INTEGRATE EMAIL 
MARKETING
Do you have a regular 
newsletter? If not then shame 
on you, go start one now. 
Then integrate the sign up 
with your Facebook page. 
There‚Äôs no point in going to all 
of the effort of making people 
like you if you don‚Äôt leverage 
it to get an opportunity to 
pitch your business.
RETARGETING
We know it kinda goes 
against the ethos of this 
list to suggest you simply 
pay for adverts, but 
Facebook‚Äôs retargeting 
system rocks. And even 
better it doesn‚Äôt have to 
cost much. The more 
people see you the more 
likely they are to buy, so 
retarget to make sure they 
see you again!

QUANTITY
The average lifespan of a 
single tweet is measured in 
minutes. Even assuming you 
have a good audience then 
tweeting once a day is only 
ever going to reach a tiny 
fraction of them. You should 
be aiming to post multiple 
times a day. Retweet yourself 
if you have to.
CONVERSATION
It seems a little odd to 
think of Twitter as a place 
for conversations when 
you remember the 
character limit, but it 
really is. Answer people, 
compliment them, thank 
them for retweeting you. 
Show them the person 
behind the tweets, and 
you will reap the rewards.
BECOME THE 
EXPERT
If you aren‚Äôt tweeting links  
to interesting articles about 
your industry then you are 
missing a trick. Portray 
yourself as being 
knowledgeable and at the 
cutting edge without having 
to write your own content.  
That a real win-win situation.
MOVING 
PICTURES
Everyone likes a good GIF 
right? Get yourself over 
to Giphy and start using 
them as answers. You‚Äôd 
be amazed at how many 
conversations are taking 
place on Twitter right 
now with nothing but 
GIFs. Come and join in.
RIDE THE COAT-
TAILS OF FAME
Tag people. The more 
followers the better. Make 
sure they are relevant to 
your business, and your 
tweet is relevant to them. 
All it takes is one retweet, 
or reply from a big name 
in your industry for 
people to notice you.

INSTAGRAM POWER TIPS

GET ON BRAND
Creating a content strategy 
helps keep you on track 
when deciding what to 
post. Make a recognisable 
look for everything you do 
and soon people will start 
to know it is you before 
they even see your name. 
Help your potential 
customers see the world 
your way to make them 
feel connected.
USE VIDEO TO 
CONNECT
Because Instagram is so 
focused on photo 
sharing, people often 
forget about video. Lots 
of people don‚Äôt bother 
because of the length 
restrictions, but if you‚Äôre 
happy to record live then 
you can have video of up 
to an hour in length.
#USE HASHTAGS
Hashtags are massive on 
Instagram. Unlike on other 
social media sites where they 
have been shown to have a 
negative effect, hashtags 
genuinely help people find 
your content. Use trending 
hashtags to get visibility, and 
create your own brand 
hashtags for others to use. 
Just make sure that you 
monitor them!
REMEMBER THE 
COMMUNITY
Whatever your feelings about 
Instagram, it‚Äôs still social 
media. Which means it‚Äôs about 
interaction. Like your 
customers‚Äô pics, especially if 
they have your products in 
them. Reply to comments on 
your images, and make sure to 
comment on other people‚Äôs. 
Don‚Äôt forget to tag people too!
COMPETITIONS
As a general rule of 
thumb the sort of person 
who is active on 
Instagram is creative and 
likes taking pictures. 
Running a competition 
with a specific hashtag is 
a lovely way to drive 
awareness of your brand 
while letting people do 
what they already like to 
do anyway.

starting at $29 per month, ranging to
$299 a month for scaling your online
shop. Shopify charges a 2.2% fee
with an extra 20p charge for all
online sales, but this is not the case if
you use their Shopify Payments
platform to process sales on your
site. Not only is Shopify great
because of its ease, but anyone can
set up an online website directly with
their packages, which include 24/7
support, a website or blog, free SSL
certificates and fraud analysis ‚Äì
taking all the boring tedious stuff
away from you. However, Shopify,  
as a blogging or online storm 
platform, often cannot keep up with 
a CMS such as WordPress with its 
content management ease and SEO 
features. Other issues arise when 
you want to switch to another 
platform, as most features are 
locked in, meaning a transition to 
another platform may not be so 
easy. In conclusion, Shopify is all 
about easy setup, quick sales and 
expanding your business online with 
ease as a regular internet shopper, 
but as a developer it may seem 
frustrating with the limited support 
for custom code or scripts that you 
wish to add.

WooCommerce is one of the most
popular free WordPress plugins
available. It gives users the ability to 
set up an online shop with ease. You 
can sell your product anywhere and 
make your WordPress website or 
blog available to take digital and 
physical orders through the power 
of WooCommerce.
Customisation, to separate 
yourself from the rest, is key, and 
WooCommerce provides such 
features with themes and more 
plugins to change the styling of your 
shop and expand accessibility and 
other features. WooCommerce 
provides great security when 
processing transactions, taking all 
the worry away from you as an 
owner, and your customers. 
Another great feature of 
WooCommerce is its vast range of 
analytic tools. These are great
for engaging with customer
purchases and activity, crunching 
stats and monthly orders ‚Äì making 
the whole process of analysing your 
data simple.
On the other hand, 
WooCommerce, although free, can 
become very expensive very quickly 
with the need for specific themes 
and plugins that have attached fees. 
You can customise your shop on 
your own if you have the skills, but 
otherwise you‚Äôll need to buy a 
premade theme if you‚Äôre not so tech 
savvy. In conclusion, WooCommerce 
is a great, free plugin for WordPress 
and provides amazing tools for 
analytics and secure transactions, 
but may soon become costly with 
any required customisation.

6 WAYS TO 
GET INTO
CREATIVE
CODING
LET YOUR IMAGINATION 
RUN FREE BY PLAYING 
AROUND IN CODE. SEE HOW 
LIBRARIES, BROWSERS AND 
APIS CAN COME TOGETHER 
TO CREATE MESMERISING 
VISUAL DISPLAYS
I
t is difficult to define exactly 
what ‚Äòcreative coding‚Äô means. In 
broad terms, it refers to the 
production of something that is 
expressive in nature rather than 
having a purely practical use. It is a 
chance to learn and explore how 
various different technologies can 
come together to create impressive 
works of art.
What form that takes is entirely up 
to the creator. Anything from data 
visualisation to image manipulation 
could be considered ‚Äòcreative 
coding‚Äô. The web is flexible enough 
to open up opportunities in different 
areas of art and design.
Here we look at the different ways 
you can experiment with code and 
create stimulating visual results.

HOT 101 ________________________________________________47
TOP 4 LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS
SKIP THE SETUP AND START GETTING INVENTIVE
p5.js
p5 s.or
Processing is the holy grail for creative
coders. It provides a language and an 
IDE to enable designers and non-
technical people to create stunning 
visualisations without getting buried in
the technicalities.
The p5.js library takes the principles
of processing and applies them to the 
web. It delivers the same kinds of 
abstractions, which provide simplicity 
to the beginners and offer powerful 
control to experts.
The bulk of the work happens 
within two functions ‚Äì one controls the
project setup, while the other draws to
the page in a loop for the life of that 
project. The library supplies plenty of 
global methods and variables to 
update the page within these 
functions. For example, calling 
frameRate(60) lets p5.js do the hard 
work of maintaining a constant 60fps.
D3
d3 s.or
While D3 has long been the go-to 
library for creating graphs and charts,
that isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs capable of. Its 
data-driven approach makes it great 
for creating attractive visualisations ‚Äì 
either informative or abstract. When 
combined with a rich data source 
such as the Twitter API, it makes 
infographics easy to create.
By manipulating DOM elements, 
such as SVG, D3 will work with any 
assets already a part of an application.
It provides a structure around which 
they can be transformed to provide 
emphasis or to animate onscreen.
There are plenty of ways to access 
D3 through other libraries and 
frameworks as well. Specially created 
components for React, directives for 
Angular, and plugins for most other 
front-end frameworks are readily 
available, for example.
sketch.js
soulwire. ithub.io/sketch. s
Weighing in at under 5kb, sketch.js is a 
tiny framework that helps developers 
get up and running with creative 
JavaScript. It‚Äôs light enough to embed 
in any website, but provides plenty of 
features along with it.
It‚Äôs possible to hook into methods 
that react to events within the 
projects. While this includes the usual 
callbacks, such as the animation loop, 
sketch.js also opens up events such as 
keyboard input and window resizing.
Touch and mouse inputs are 
treated the same, which makes all 
projects touch-friendly by default. 
While it is possible to target either 
input type specifically, it takes the 
worry out of dealing with the small 
differences between the two event 
types. It can also calculate the deltas 
between these points automatically to 
make physics calculations easier.
three.js
three s.or
Working in 3D with WebGL can be 
complicated at the best of times. 
Working out how shaders and camera 
perspectives work in such a wide-
reaching API can take away from the 
creative aspects of a project and slow 
everything down.
With three.js it‚Äôs possible to skim 
over these tricky aspects and focus on 
the visuals. It is a 3D JavaScript library, 
which works with WebGL to easily 
create beautifully smooth interactions 
with minimum effort. 
The library provides many built-in 
methods for creating objects in the 
scene. Everything can be altered just 
like any other JavaScript object and 
will update accordingly. Complicated 
techniques, such as texture mapping, 
are provided out of the box and are 
usually just a case of setting the 
appropriate option on the object.

GET SMART WITH DATA SOURCES AND APIs
GET NEW DATA FROM ELSEWHERE AND KEEP YOUR PROJECT FRESH
graphing live tweets about a topic 
from around the world.
While there are plenty of 
opportunities to use the output from 
Twitter, the API also allows for 
applications to post messages to 
Twitter. These can come from any 
source provided that it‚Äôs connected  
to the API.
All endpoints in the API require 
some kind of authentication. For most 
projects that is only an application key, 
but authenticating can be tricky when 
done manually. Thankfully there are a 
few packages that make working with 
the Twitter API a little easier.
The npm module ‚Äòtwitter‚Äô is the 
catch-all client library when working 
through Node. It supports regular 
endpoints as well as streaming, which 
may be useful for real-time projects.
The ‚Äòflickr.photos.search‚Äô endpoint is 
the most commonly used and gives 
access to most of Flickr‚Äôs content. It 
can be filtered and sorted by date, 
location and even license as 
necessary. Other endpoints can get 
more detail on the photo, such as 
comments or EXIF data
Getting the API to work exactly how 
the project needs it to can be difficult, 
particularly if writing information back 
to Flickr. Luckily, plenty of packages
exist to help use it with JavaScript,
including the company‚Äôs own
‚Äòflickr-sdk‚Äô on npm.
It‚Äôs important to note that all images
remain the property of their owners.
For personal projects this will not be
an issue, but if it‚Äôs being shared be
sure to either seek permission or
credit the owner.
Twitter
With over 320 million active users in 
2017, Twitter is a wealth of information. 
People are talking about every 
conceivable topic by posting pictures 
and video alongside their unfiltered 
reactions in real time.
This makes it a goldmine for a 
creative coding project. The official API 
can bring back the tweets in the 
format needed along with other 
metadata that is open for analysis. This 
data can then be visualised in new 
and exciting ways.
The Twitter API provides four 
defined ‚Äòobjects‚Äô that can be retrieved 
‚Äì tweets, users, locations and entities. 
Entities include extra information 
linked to those objects including 
hashtags and media. Values on these 
objects are fixed and will only ever be 
extended upon, which means you will 
never lose access.
Tweets themselves can be searched 
for with a query to a single endpoint. 
These searches can either be for a 
string or can be more descriptive, 
such as for images or tweets with a 
positive sentiment.
Visualising Twitter data can make a 
great connected design piece. 
Combining multiple data points such 
as location and sentiment can create a 
project that is also informative, such as 
Instagram and Flickr
Creative coding projects are often 
visual, which makes image and video 
sharing APIs an attractive prospect for 
inspiration. Thankfully, sites such as 
Instagram and Flickr open up their 
data and allow developers access to 
that content, as well as the 
surrounding metadata.
Instagram has become one of the 
web‚Äôs most popular image-sharing 
platforms. As a result, it is a rich source 
of images to use in creative projects.
The API is no different. It provides 
access to images, videos, comments 
and tags, as well as ways of searching 
through this information to find what is 
needed for the project.
Access within the API will be initially 
limited to a small pool of accounts and 
images. To remove some of these 
restrictions, Instagram will need to 
review the project themselves, which 
can be time-consuming and fruitless 
for creative coding projects. 
Depending on the project, the initial 
sandbox mode may suffice.
Flickr has a more readily accessible 
API. It is a resource of high quality 
images available at multiple 
resolutions. Many of the photo 
endpoints only require an application 
key to work, which makes set up and 
fetching much easier.

MOBILE DEVICE SENSORS
WORK WITH THEIR UNIQUE INPUTS
})
.then(function(stream) {
  // Access input
})
.catch(function(error) {
  // Provide fallback option
});
The code has to specify exactly what 
is needed from the input devices. The 
call to getUserMedia() will trigger a 
permissions dialog that the user must 
accept before continuing. Once
accepted, these features are available
as streams, making them more
memory efficient.
All major browsers support this API,
including mobile. If the browser
cannot meet the exact requirements,
the promise will reject and not work.
It‚Äôs important to supply an alternative
experience, such as an image upload
form, where access is not possible.
rientation‚Äù, e => {
  console.log(e.gamma);
});
window.addEventListener(‚Äúdevicem
otion‚Äù, e => {
  console.log(e.acceleration);
});
APIs provide access to this 
information, but the values 
returned will vary by browser as 
they do not all use the same 
coordinate system. Libraries such 
as p5.js provide special values and 
hooks like ‚ÄòrotationX‚Äô or
‚ÄòdeviceShaken()‚Äô to help abstract 
away the differences.
Mobile devices also have the 
ability to determine their exact 
position using geolocation. Being 
able to get the exact location of a 
device can open up new
possibilities and make for a more 
streamlined experience.
navigator.geolocation.
getCurrentPosition(pos => {
console.log(pos.coords); });
Access is provided through the 
navigator object. The value 
returned is the lat-long co-ordinates 
of the device, along with other data 
such as altitude or speed if the 
device supports it. Browsers will 
use the fastest method of detecting 
location, such as the IP address. 
However, this may not always be 
the most accurate.
Combining these inputs in 
creative ways is the key to making 
something special. For example, 
using the device‚Äôs location and 
orientation to create a virtual 
stargazing experience.
Camera and Microphone
The web is usually limited to pointing 
and clicking with a mouse, but that is 
not the only way of providing input. 
Today‚Äôs browsers are equipped with 
new APIs to pull in data from different 
external sources, including cameras 
and microphones.
Making projects that are visually 
aware is a great way to get users 
involved. By using vision as an input 
over a traditional keyboard and 
mouse, users are able to interact in 
different ways, such as face tracking or 
image recognition. As most devices 
now come with a camera built in, it is 
no longer the barrier it once was and 
works out great for the web.
Listening to the user is also a great 
alternative to manual input. Voice 
recognition could control navigation, 
or users could provide their own audio 
samples to use within their experience. 
It could also serve as an alternative to 
a button press. By extracting pitch and 
volume, these can then be mapped to 
what normally would be a button 
press, which could be used to control 
anything from colour to movement.
Access to a camera and 
microphone is possible through the 
navigator object.
navigator.mediaDevices.
getUserMedia({
audio: true,
  video: { width: 640, height: 480 
}
The world of mobile presents a 
completely different set of 
opportunities when it comes to 
creative coding. The wide variety of 
form factors and sensors open for 
use within the browser can make 
for some distinctive experiences.
Mobile devices are almost 
exclusively touch interfaces. 
Browsers have the ability to detect 
and track multiple touches at once.
This means that projects do not
have to be led by a single point and
can be manipulated in a much more
intuitive way.
window.
addEventListener(‚Äútouchstart‚Äù, e
=> {
e.preventDefault();
const touches = e.
changedTouches;
});
All touch events use a
‚ÄòchangedTouches‚Äô property on the
event. This holds a reference to all
the touch points that changed
dependent on the type of event,
rather than a separate event for
each touch point. By tracking these,
it‚Äôs possible to map gestures or
paint with touch.
Accelerometers and gyroscopes
are mostly used for changing from
portrait to landscape mode, but
these are also up for interpretation.
Different methods of interaction
can be created by using the device
itself as a control mechanism
‚Äì whether that in specific co-
ordinate movements or more
gesture-based, such as a shake.

around the world and see where they 
had come from.
Interactions such as these can be 
made easier with WebSockets. 
Communication between a browser 
and the server is event based, 
avoiding the need to poll the server, 
which can often be wasteful and 
prone to delays. Projects such as 
Socket.io can make setting up 
WebSocket protocols easier.
Direct communication between 
devices can also have a powerful 
effect when users are together in the
same room. Seb Lee-Delisle‚Äôs
PixelPhones project (seb.ly/?p=2415),
for example, turned a crowd of
screens into a makeshift display. Once
all were connected, everybody
became part of the experience.
WebRTC is a set of JavaScript APIs
that makes real-time communication
between browsers easier. It needs a
server to set up a connection, media is
sent directly between browsers, which
makes interactions quick and simple
to create. Now supported by all major
browsers both on desktop and mobile.
Even the most creative of coding 
projects can become stale after a 
while. An element of randomness can 
keep things fresh each time a piece of 
code runs. While that can come from 
user input, it can be interesting to see 
what code is capable off when it‚Äôs let 
off of the leash.
Instead of defining what the output 
of a block of code would be, define a 
set of rules for it to follow. When a 
random starting position is defined, 
the end results will vary completely.
Conway‚Äôs Game of Life is a great 
place to start. In a defined grid, each 
square can either be ‚Äòon‚Äô or ‚Äòoff‚Äô
depending on the squares around it.
By colouring the squares dependant
on their state, it generates an image.
While browsers are getting more
capable and powerful every day, there
is only so much that one viewport can
provide. Thankfully, browsers are also
expanding out of the browser too.
Virtual Reality (VR) has the ability to
immerse the viewer in ways not
possible before. WebVR is an open
specification that allows access to
these immersive worlds to the masses
through the browser. It also helps
bridge the gap between different
device types, such as Google
Cardboard and the HTC Vive.
Frameworks, such as A-Frame, can
help bypass any complications by
providing ready-to-go building blocks
for VR experiences. Since these are
built for performance and reliability,
Desktop browsers provide reassuring 
familiarity when it comes to creative 
projects. But by experimenting with 
different displays, users can get a 
more personalised experience which 
works for them.
The principles of responsive design 
still hold true for creative coding 
projects as well. Users should be able 
to enjoy them regardless of device, 
whether that‚Äôs desktop, mobile, or 
projected on a giant screen.
These differences can also be used 
to enhance the project further. By
using media queries in CSS, mobile
users could get an experience tailored
to the smaller, handheld form factor.
Since mobile users tend to be just one
person, these visitors could be offered
a more personalised view of a bigger
platform, for example.
Paper Planes, by company Active

understand your capability to work with others, 
not just your design/coding skills. 
Given how much of our work requires human

understand that you know how to manage 
yourself ‚Äì and relationships.
In addition, it‚Äôs useful to ask clients to add

DON‚ÄôT GET COCKY, KID
There‚Äôs nothing worse than a pretentious 
designer‚Äôs overly ‚Äòdesigned‚Äô website, which 
they‚Äôve thrown all the bells and whistles at to 
showcase their abilities, but neglected to 
provide clear routes to see the work itself.
I should know, because as a junior, I spent 
every waking hour redesigning my own website 
to chuck in more wizardry that I‚Äôd learnt, only to 
realise that basically all anyone needs is a nice, 
simple, clean looking page with a clear list of all 
the work completed, complete with the ability to 
jump into it, and an easy way of moving back to 
the list, or jumping to the next item. Oh ‚Äì and 
make sure your images are big, bold and extra 
clear. On mobile and desktop! 
ALL ABOUT THE DETAIL
In your case studies, pick up on the small details 
you agonised over and the reasons why. For 
example, talk about the complexity of a JavaScript-
driven menu that allows you to navigate to the 
lowest level in the site in just a couple of clicks to 
improve UX. As long as you don‚Äôt get too geeky, 
this will illustrate how you approach work ‚Äì with 
clear attention to detail.
Ask how a fine furniture maker might talk about 
the beautiful mahogany cabinet he‚Äôs just made that 
took him 3,000 hours to produce. He‚Äôd likely 
mention joins, hinges, handles and polishing. When 
you consider your work is akin to a traditional 
craftsman, you can begin to see more than just 
graphics and code.
TELL A STORY
It‚Äôs easy to just explain what you did when talking 
about a project, but it can be far more interesting  
to explain why you did it. By weaving the redesign  
or project into a narrative you can begin to draw in  
the audience a little more than a simple deluge of  
facts and figures. 
For example, as opposed to ‚Äúwe redesigned and 
built the new eCommerce store for XYZ.com‚Äù, you 
could begin with explaining who they are, what their 
current scenario was and the solution you came to 
help evolve them out of their current predicament.

Node.JS is a godsend to JavaScript developers.  
The latest version of the ‚Äúbrowser-breaking device‚Äù 
brings a neat set of new features. Let‚Äôs take a look‚Ä¶
9?
HTTP/2 ON HAND!
Google‚Äôs HTTP/2 protocol speeds up the delivery of 
web content by reducing redundancies in the server-client-
communication process. 
While the new version of this technology has been 
supported in Node.JS for quite some time, using it required 
the use of an additional, pesky flag. Node.JS 9 does away 
with that ‚Äì simply fire up the runtime, include the ‚Äòhttp2‚Äô 
module and enjoy the significantly increased processing 
speeds. However, do keep in mind that the benefits can 
only be harnessed if the client also fully understands the 
HTTP/2 protocol and how it works.
const http2 = require('http2');
const fs = require('fs');
const server = http2.createSecureServer({
  key: fs.readFileSync('localhost-privkey.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('localhost-cert.pem')
});
server.on('error', (err) => console.error(err));
server.on('socketError', (err) => console.error(err));
NO-HASSLE ERROR HANDLING!
Developers creating the error-handling parts of an 
API face a difficult trade-off ‚Äì returning textual errors 
makes emitting them to the console easier, while using 
numeric constants simplifies programmatic handling. 
Node.js 9 now gives developers the best of both worlds ‚Äì a 
set of error codes specified in https://nodejs.org/api/
errors.html#errors_node_js_error_codes can be used to 
facilitate error comparisons. Eliminating string constants 
from programs is considered a superbly efficient 
refactoring ‚Äì if there is one feature in Node.JS you ought to 
use, it definitely is this one.
OLD
if (err.message === 'Can\'t set headers after they are 
sent.') {
 
NEW
if (err.code === 'ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT') {
What‚Äôs new in
VARIOUS UNDERLYING UPDATES!
As complex as Node.JS is, it also makes use of 
various libraries contributed by third parties. Almost all of 
them received updates in the last few months ‚Äì the Node 
team used the release of the new version to upgrade. This 
brings a variety of improvements ‚Äì for example, the V8 
interpreter received optimisations leading to  
impressive improvements. 
Sadly, this improvement also meant that some old 
experimental or deprecated APIs were removed ‚Äì be 
careful when updating a solution.
PLAY CLEANLY!
Like most large software products, Node.JS had its 
fair share of oddities. For example, the HTTP error 400 was 
not supported ‚Äì if bad data came in via a HTTP stream, the 
socket was closed. This behaviour caused grief when the 
‚Äòopposing‚Äô end expected a formally correct implementation. 
Node.JS 9 busts a lot of these problems, making sure that 
the product plays nicely with various other components. In 
addition to that, read-only flags and method return values 
were adjusted; this is intended to make errors show up 
much, much faster.
POWER TO THE ASSERTIVE!
Well-placed statements simplify the detection of 
error conditions. The latest version of Node.JS allows 
additional error codes in asserts, thereby allowing 
statement logic to expose information on why the test  
on hand failed. 
One other particularly neat feature involves the exposure 
of the ‚ÄòisDeepStrictEqual‚Äô method. Its signature has been 
modified to return an error code instead of throwing, 
thereby permitting developers to harness its comparison 
capabilities outside of a debugging environment.
const { isDeepStrictEqual } = require('util')
const isEq = isDeepStrictEqual({
  a: '1'
}, {
  a: 1
})

3
REASONS TO 
USEORIGAMI
PROTOTYPINGAPPROACHES WHICHISTHEBESTWAY?
In a world where users have high 
expectations of their experience on 
the web and mobile, prototyping 
and user evaluation is key. A good 
or bad user experience can make 
or break your site or app, and 
therefore you often won‚Äôt want to 
jump straight in and build the final 
product only to have to go back 
and change much of your code at
a later stage.
Instead, it‚Äôs now common to
progressively iterate on prototypes
with increasingly high fidelity, and a
flourishing user experience
industry has grown up around this
critical set of activities. Ultimately,
getting software right at the
prototyping stage saves you time
and/or money later on.
There are many approaches you
can take to prototyping, and
numerous tools out there to assist.
Of course, almost every designer
has their opinion on which tool or
tools work best. One of the newest
on the block is Origami Studio,
developed by Facebook and
available free for macOS. Origami
Studio, which actually started its
life as a plugin for Quartz
Composer (a visual programming
language within macOS‚Äôs Xcode
development environment) before
becoming a standalone tool, has
gained a great deal of attention
over the last year. This is not only
because it is built by a big-name
developer, but also because of the
combination of power and
simplicity it brings to developing
high-fidelity, interactive prototypes.
We‚Äôve all encountered 
software which is 
frustrating to use, and 
with the range of tools 
available to help, it‚Äôs 
inexcusable these days 
not to apply a thorough 
focus on user experience 
design and evaluation. 
Developers don‚Äôt want 
to build an entire app 
before it‚Äôs shown to 
users, and designers 
are looking for the 
ability to quickly iterate 
without code. This is 
where prototyping tools 
like Origami Studio can 
really help. You should 
be prototyping early and 
iterating often, and you‚Äôll 
quickly see the benefits.
SIMONJONES
SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDIRECTOR
REAL-TIME PREVIEWS
The preview window in Origami is always open, so 
you can constantly see the state of your work while 
you‚Äôre modifying it, without the need to save and 
build or open in a browser as is the case in some 
other tools. Then there‚Äôs the Origami Live mobile 
app which allows you to mirror your Origami Studio 
prototype on an actual mobile device.
HIGH-FIDELITY INTERACTIONS
Prototyping isn‚Äôt just about the visual 
look and feel of a site or app, but also 
about understanding user interactions 
and making sure the functionality is 
simple to learn and use. Often interaction 
is modelled by stitching static prototypes 
together, but Origami offers a more sophisticated ‚ÄòPatch‚Äô framework to 
allow interactions to be modelled with a high level of fidelity without the 
need for programming.
NATIVE PLATFORM SUPPORT
Origami Studio leads the way in providing support 
for native mobile platform features such as 
direction, vibration, and haptic feedback. Want to 
respond to 3D Touch events on an iPhone? 
Origami has built-in functionality to simulate this 
and let you respond to the level of force. A wide 
range of different devices are supported.
STITCH TOGETHER STATIC MOCKUPS
This can be a quick, easy way to get 
started, especially to show visual 
design. It‚Äôs not uncommon for 
designers to use Illustrator, Sketch, 
or similar to create static mock-ups, 
then show directly to users to 
evaluate or distribute to developers. 
Interactions can be expressed using 
annotations or voice-over. This 
approach is often used for 
low-fidelity prototypes preceding 
higher-fidelity design, using 
wireframing tools like Balsamiq.
USE AN INTERACTIVE  
PROTOTYPING TOOL
Origami Studio is one of a number 
of both free and commercial 
high-fidelity prototyping tools out 
there. Proto.io is another popular 
one. These tools bring a great 
balance between being able to 
throw something together quickly 
without needing to code, while 
enabling interactive functionality to 
avoid any ambiguity for developers 
or users. However, it does mean a 
new skillset and tool to learn.
JUST CODE A PAGE
Sometimes it‚Äôs easiest to code up 
the basic functionality to test it out. 
This is particularly true if there isn‚Äôt 
a separate designer working on the 
app, and made easier by the extent 
to which frameworks prefabricate 
components. This gives the highest 
fidelity experience to users if you‚Äôre 
evaluating, but may mean that 
iteration is more time-consuming. It 
also abstracts you from any 
constraints of the functionality 
available in prototyping tools.
It‚Äôs now common to 
progressively iterate on 
prototypes with increasingly 
high fidelity, and a flourishing 
user experience industry has 
grown up around this critical 
set of activities

ORIGAMI STUDIO
READY-MADELAYERS
In the bottom right of the Origami
Studio window, you‚Äôll see a list of all
layers present in your prototype. This
behaves as you might expect if you‚Äôve
worked with layer-based graphics tools
before, and you can drag to reprioritise
layers, group them together, and so on.
Typically your layers might include
images, text and static colours, but
Origami also ships with a selection of
pre-fabricated ones such as mobile
keyboards and status bars to allow you
to more easily mimic an actual device.
INSTANTUPDATES
Origami Studio‚Äôs preview area allows you not only to view
the appearance of your prototype, but also to test out
interactions with it. You can select from a range of different
media including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs to
display your work on. The best part, however, is that it‚Äôs
always open and updates instantly when you make changes
to the design or functionality, so you‚Äôll be able to see the
impact straight away.
INPUTS&OUTPUTS
The behaviour of prototypes in Origami
Studio is controlled via ‚Äòpatches‚Äô, which
are essentially functions that take inputs
(such as user interactions or numeric
values) and generate outputs which can
then be used to modify attributes of the
visual layers in your prototype. For
example, a patch that outputs a value
between 0 and 1 can be used to control
the opacity of an image. Pre-defined
patches that ship with Origami are linked
together into a visual flow to create
complex behaviour.
WORKINGWITHLAYERS
Since Origami Studio is a layer-based
system (think similar to Photoshop),
depending on which layer of your
prototype you currently have selected, it
will display a set of properties you can
modify. This allows you to position layers
on the screen, resize them, recolour, and
so on. Most critically, dragging the output
of a patch to a property will link them,
enabling the patch to control the
behaviour of that layer. The + symbol just
above this area enables you to add new
layers to the screen.

HOT 101 ________________________________________________63
BUILD WITH ORIGAMI
YOUR FIRST APP
HERE‚ÄôS HOW TO EASILY GET INTERACTIONS WORKING
and search for ‚Äòinteraction‚Äô. Place  
your patch and it should appear on 
the screen.
4.LINKING INTERACTIONS TO LAYERS
At the moment, your patch will 
respond to touch anywhere on the 
prototype. Test it out by clicking and 
you‚Äôll see the ‚ÄòDown‚Äô and ‚ÄòTap‚Äô 
properties changing in real time. If you 
select the ‚ÄòLayer‚Äô property in the 
patch, you can link it to the layer 
containing the heart image, and it will 
now only respond to clicks on that 
specific area.
5. ANIMATIONS
Now we want to have something 
happen when our interaction triggers. 
Create another patch, this time a ‚ÄòPop 
Animation‚Äô. This is used to create a 
springy effect. Leave the properties as 
they are for now, but we‚Äôll create a link 
between the Tap output of the 
Interaction we created previously and 
the Number input of our new Pop 
Animation. We do this by clicking and 
dragging between the small circles 
next to each. If you click the heart 
now, you‚Äôll now see the interaction 
triggers a change in the ‚ÄòProgress‚Äô 
output of the Pop Animation.
6. TRANSITIONS
The next thing we need is a Transition 
patch. This will allow us to specify low 
and high values to move between as 
the Pop Animation‚Äôs Progress output 
changes. We can then link the 
Transition‚Äôs output values to the Scale 
property of the heart image layer to 
tell Origami to resize it when it‚Äôs 
clicked. You should now find that 
clicking the heart causes it to animate 
a brief change in size. It‚Äôs not quite 
right, however, since it pops back to 
normal straight away.
7.SWITCHES
Switch patches are Origami‚Äôs way of 
toggling between two states. This is 
what we want for our ‚ÄòLike‚Äô button. An 
input passed to a Switch patch can flip 
it between ‚Äòon‚Äô and ‚Äòoff‚Äô states, which 
can then be passed as an output to 
subsequent patches. Let‚Äôs create a 
new Switch and place it between the 
Interaction and the Pop Animation. 
1.ANEW PROTOTYPE
We‚Äôre going to create a prototype for a 
mobile app which will allow us to 
swipe through pictures of cats and 
‚Äòlike‚Äô some of them. Once we‚Äôve 
installed Origami Studio, we‚Äôll create a 
new iPhone 8 prototype from the 
splash screen.
2. ADDING LAYERS
We can start to add some layers to 
our prototype straight away. In this 
case, we‚Äôll add a logo positioned at the 
top of the screen. We add the layer 
using the + button in the top right and 
selecting ‚ÄòImage Layer‚Äô. We can then 
resize and position it appropriately by 
highlighting and modifying the layer‚Äôs 
properties. After our brand, we‚Äôll also 
add a heart image at the bottom of 
the screen to serve as our ‚Äòlike‚Äô button.
3.CREATING AN INTERACTION
We need to make our heart button 
respond to user interactions. You‚Äôll 
notice that in the preview window, the 
cursor changes to represent touch on 
a mobile device. To respond to this, we 
need to create a ‚ÄòPatch‚Äô, which is 
essentially a function in Origami  
that takes inputs and produces 
outputs. Double-click the empty grey 
area to bring up a list of new patches, 
1.  IDENTIFY YOUR USER GROUPS 
Testing with real users is 
important, and often yields 
surprising results. But equally 
important is ensuring you test 
with the RIGHT users who 
represent typical usage of your 
app. Personas and looking at 
usage data/metrics can be very 
useful for this.
2.  PLAN YOUR TASKS  
AND QUESTIONS 
Generally you‚Äôll want to set 
your evaluation users tasks 
which reflect typical activities 
to be performed with your app. 
You should also plan neutral, 
non-leading questions to pose 
during this process.
3.  ENCOURAGE USER 
CONTRIBUTION 
When you evaluate prototypes, 
you‚Äôre not just trying to make 
yes/no decisions on elements 
of your design. You should also 
encourage subjective feedback 
and improvement or feature 
suggestions from your users. 
But beware of scope creep!
4.  ITERATE ON YOUR DESIGN 
Typically it takes a few rounds 
of prototyping, at progressively 
higher fidelity, to achieve a 
great design. Allow time to go 
back to the drawing board and 
re-work your prototypes once 
you‚Äôve gathered feedback, 
then repeat the process again.
5.  BE OPEN TO BEING WRONG 
We all take pride in our work, 
and when a user gives 
feedback, it‚Äôs sometimes 
tempting to spend time 
explaining why we did 
something a particular way. 
This isn‚Äôt really a good use of 
time or energy, though. Take 
the feedback, and 
acknowledge that you might 
have got it wrong.

10.SWIPING LEFT ANDRIGHT
The last thing we need to do to make
it work is enable left and right swipes
to scroll the carousel. We do this by
creating a Scroll interaction to link to
the carousel layer group (not the
individual images). The interaction
outputs an x co-ordinate which we can 
then link to the x property of the 
carousel to move it. In-between, we‚Äôll 
add a Clip patch, which can be used to 
limit values to ensure we do not scroll 
to co-ordinates outside the edge of 
the carousel.
11. NEXT STEPS
That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôve created a very basic 
app. You can also use Origami Studio‚Äôs 
built in ‚Äòframes‚Äô to place it onto a 
device background, which can help 
give a professional finish. Now that 
you‚Äôre familiar with the basics of using 
You should then be able to click the 
heart to toggle it between small and 
large states.
8. MORE COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR
Congratulations! You‚Äôve now created 
your first interactive feature, using the 
most common patches that you‚Äôll find 
you use time and time again. We can 
add more patches to create more 
complex behaviour. Let‚Äôs create a 
different coloured heart layer directly 
behind our current one, then add new 
patches both to scale it 
simultaneously, and modify the 
opacity of our original layer so it‚Äôs 
made visible. Now, when you tap the 
heart, it will toggle larger and smaller, 
but also appear to change colour.
9. CAROUSEL
To finish our prototype, let‚Äôs add an 
image carousel with the cats we want 
to allow users to ‚ÄòLike‚Äô. To do this, we 
first need to add a group of layers. 
Each image will be a separate layer, 
with increasingly offset x co-ordinates 
so that they essentially sit side-by-size 
in a row with only one visible on 
screen at any one item.

SHARING WITH ORIGAMI
There are a few ways to share 
your prototypes with others. 
Since Origami Studio is free, you 
may wish to just distribute the  
.origami file itself if you‚Äôre sharing 
with other Mac users. However, 
Origami also offers the option to 
record video of a journey through 
your prototype. At the top of the 
preview window is a ‚ÄúRecord 
Prototype‚Äù button which will 
switch to full-screen mode and let 
you interact with it while 
recording. Another way of 
utilising prototypes is with the 
Origami Live companion app 
which will display your prototype 
on a real mobile device while 
connected to your Mac.
SPAGHETTI 
PROCESS
You can drag patches 
around on the screen to 
re-organise them. It‚Äôs worth 
taking the time to lay them out 
sensibly, as for complex 
interactions it can quickly 
become hard to follow if 
they don‚Äôt appear in 
a logical order.
patches, you can begin to create more 
advanced behaviours. There are 
plenty of guides on the Origami Studio 
website, which explain how to 
implement popular functionalities 
commonly seen in apps.

Zeta are a team of artisans that wield today‚Äôs 
digital tools to deliver engaging content to waiting 
audiences. With a deep understanding of each 
digital channel, brands partner with Zeta to 
develop new experiences that push the  
boundaries of mobile and the web
Why name the agency Zeta? Sam Allen 
‚Äì Operations Director explains: ‚ÄúWhen the 
agency was formed, there were just six 
members, resulting in the team choosing 
Zeta, the sixth letter of the Greek 
alphabet. The original domain chosen 
was zeta-commerce.com. It‚Äôs now Zeta.
net; easier to remember and less 
restrictive in terms of brand positioning, 
giving us the freedom to evolve.‚Äù
The website of a design agency is, of 
course, an important calling card to 
prospective clients. Anna Lundstr√∂m 
Silsbury ‚Äì Project Manager ‚Äì outlines how 
Zeta approach their design: ‚ÄúWe believe 
an agency‚Äôs site is very important;

‚ÄúWe suggest if you are 
invited to attend an

research the agency and 
ask lots of pertinent

recommend anyone who 
hasn‚Äôt got much working 
experience to get 
themselves out there on

it provides an insight into their services, 
portfolio, ethos and approach, as well as their 
brand and its values. We know the first

and what we offer on our site.‚Äù
Anna continues: ‚ÄúFor example, a recent 
audit of our site highlighted the need to 
change our vernacular, positioning us as 
a more jargon-free agency. It also 
highlighted the need to show a more 
diverse range of clients and services. 
Other recommendations included 
changing the site content more regularly 
and the release of specialist papers and 
articles. As a result, we‚Äôre building a new 
site, which is due to launch prior to 2018. 
Post launch, time is being dedicated to 
provide regular content updates.‚Äù
Often, an agency will move through 
various stages of development. Initially 
clients are attracted via a number of 
channels. For Zeta, their takeover was a 
pivotal moment, as Sam explains: ‚ÄúSince 
being acquired, the momentum of the 
company has sped up significantly. 
Although the majority of new business 
comes from referrals and digital-related 
industry talks given by our staff, we will 
be actively pursuing new clients during 
2018 via new account managers.‚Äù
Craig Dyball ‚Äì Managing Director ‚Äì  
also says: ‚ÄúDue to our current client  
base, we have naturally evolved into 
specialising in the electronics industry, 
providing websites, apps and digital 
marketing for one of the world‚Äôs largest 
eCommerce stores. We‚Äôre also 
significantly involved within the tourism 
industry, providing the full spectrum of 
digital services. Involvement in these 
areas means we generally pick up 
synergistic clients as we go.
 ‚ÄúAlthough our current project

ASTRO ALGEBRA - APP  
apple.co/2inLEcq
Zeta designed and built 
the space-themed Astro 
Algebra app for iOS, 
providing a fun way to 
learn and practise 
algebra. The app enables 
children to play quick-fire 
algebra questions whilst 
beating the rocket, earn 
stars and unlock space 
cadet badges.
Designed to support 
teaching, the app is 
simple and intuitive to 
use with a fun and 
appealing interface to 
keep users entertained 
whilst learning. Although 
aimed at children aged 
10-13, the app caters for 
adults and parents 
helping with their 
children‚Äôs homework.
With 1,000 algebra 
questions, ten different 
subjects, challenge and 
reward levels, learn-and-
play features and 
sophisticated game logic, 
the app provides a broad 
learning experience, with 
a clear focus of being 
linked to the National 
Curriculum.
The app can be used 
on phones and tablets  
by children and their 
families at home as  
well as in a school 
environment as a 
teaching resource. Astro 
Algebra was recently 
launched on Apple‚Äôs iOS 
App Store with plans to 
build an Android version 
next year. 
Zeta‚Äôs creativity  
and technical expertise 
has been recognised, 
since Astro Algebra  
has been shortlisted  
in the Educational  
App category in the 
prestigious, and highly  
coveted, Bett Awards.  
Above Zeta knew that the app would be focused on children, but 
ensured it also appealed to adults helping their children.

Group means there‚Äôs always plenty of
up-and-coming work.‚Äù
The workflow that an agency develops
often needs to be agile to respond to the
specific demands of each piece of work.
For Zeta, flexible working has become
second nature, as Anna explains:
‚ÄúLarge-scale timelines vary depending on
the scale of the project. Some projects
are ongoing ‚Äì such as Mouser.com ‚Äì with
dozens of ongoing, rolling projects with
completion deadlines many years from
now. For smaller, large-scale projects, we
generally aim to complete them within six
to seven months.
‚ÄúWhichever type of project, we aim to 
break them down into manageable 
deliverables. This means our work can 
add value to a business, at a quicker 
pace, and be responsive to changes. The 
following roles are normally included in 
all web or app projects: Project manager, 
Team leader, UX designer, UI designer, 
Full-stack web developers, Native app 
developers, Marketing expert with SEO 
skills and QA testers.
WINCHESTER SCIENCE CENTRE  
winchestersciencecentre.org
With 100 hands-on 
exhibits and a 
360-degree cinema 
experience, the 
Winchester Science 
Centre is a hub for 
informal science learning 
and a popular visitor 
attraction for schools and 
the general public. 
Entrusted with the 
Winchester Science 
Centre‚Äôs digital 
marketing, we manage 
their SEO, eCommerce 
tracking and Google 
AdWords campaigns, 
which are funded by a 
monthly Google AdWords 
Grant made available to 
non-profits organisations.
The careful execution 
of eCommerce tracking 
has allowed us to 
improve ad optimisation. 
Combined with 
campaigns created by 
Zeta, this has resulted in 
a more effective use of 
the budget, resulting in 
higher conversion rates. 
In total, we created an 
additional eight new 
highly targeted 
campaigns that targeted 
specific audiences.
All keywords that were 
found to be successful in 
Google AdWords were 
then sent to our SEO 
team to ensure that we 
appear in the top three 
positions of the organic 
listings. Having a domain 
appear at the top of 
organic and paid listings 
in Google presents your 
brand as an authority and 
increases the click-
through rate.
The results speak for 
themselves with AdWords 
delivering a 670 per cent 
increase in clicks and a 
124 per cent increase in 
click-through rates, with 
organic site traffic seeing 
an increase of 21 per cent 
after implementing our 
SEO strategy.

‚ÄúJQuery is gradually being replaced by 
JavaScript frameworks, such as React, 
especially for web apps. Frameworks are 
far more capable, with a number of 
different features, so there has been a 
shift to these over libraries such as 
JQuery. However, the technology still 
remains relevant for websites and small 
web apps, which don‚Äôt require a full 
framework, and JQuery still has a large 
market share, so is likely to be around  
for some time.
‚ÄúLaravel 5 has appeared on the  
office radar recently. It‚Äôs a useful PHP 
framework that makes web building  
easy and sharing projects between our 
developers simple. It‚Äôs been around for  
a little while now, but we‚Äôre beginning to 
utilise it more frequently, mainly because 
it‚Äôs quick to implement and comes with  
a whole host of time-saving abilities,  
such as quick-build user authentication 
for applications.‚Äù
Speaking further about the importance 
of designing for mobile channels, George 
Grover ‚Äì UX and Design ‚Äì says: ‚ÄúZeta 
advocates building fully responsive 
website solutions that deliver an 
uncompromising experience across all 
devices without restricting or hiding key 
content. We plan, wireframe, prototype 
and design with a fluid mindset. We‚Äôre 
always thinking about the content in 
‚ÄúThe project is then split into: Planning 
and exploration, wireframe, prototyping 
and design, backend and feature 
development, themes, content 
population, marketing review and testing 
and deployment. Generally, the most 
time-consuming parts of a project are the
first and last stages. Ensuring the 
planning and exploration stage is 
undertaken meticulously is essential, as 
this forms the blueprint for the project. 
The final stage, testing and development,
is equally important to ensure the project
is delivered working correctly.‚Äù
After the workflow is in place, the 
toolset that an agency chooses to use 
can be diverse. For Zeta, which works 
across multiple channels, the tools in use 
have been evolving for some years. Paul 
Barnes outlines their current approach: 
‚ÄúDuring the design stages of a project  
we use Axure to create interactive 
wireframes and prototypes to outline  
all content requirements and client 
expectations. After the wireframes have 
been confirmed, we create hi-fidelity 
designs using the Adobe Creative Cloud 
suite and the Sketch app.
‚ÄúTo create our native applications, we 
use IDE‚Äôs Xcode and Android Studio. Our 
web team uses open source applications, 
such as Sublime, to create its web 
projects. Our design team hands over 
assets to our development team using 
Axure, which outlines all navigation. For 
animation-based interactions we use 
Zeplin, allowing developers to pull assets 
and measurements from the designs.
‚ÄúUsing web tools, such as Cage App 
and Gather Content, we share designs 
and content with our clients to allow 
them access to the work in progress, and 
to give feedback during the project.‚Äù
Caleb Kingcott ‚Äì Digital Designer ‚Äì  
also explains Zeta‚Äôs approach to current 
design technologies: ‚ÄúBoth CSS and 
HTML have been fundamental to web 
development for years, something we 
don‚Äôt see changing anytime soon. 
However, we agree with the popular 
consensus that HTML and CSS will  
need to adapt to stay relevant for 
modern web development.
‚ÄúOver the last few years, the biggest 
change in web development is the 
importance of targeting mobile devices. It 
wasn‚Äôt too long ago that a mobile website 
was an afterthought for a developer, 
something that was a nice extra, which 
would only be seriously considered if the 
budget allowed. However, In April of this 
year, SimilarWeb published data 
suggesting mobile traffic makes up 
nearly 56 per cent of all web traffic. With 
this is mind, it‚Äôs important that HTML and 
CSS adapt to this change in hardware.
‚ÄúHTML has adapted and will continue 
to adapt to this change by taking 
advantage of mobile hardware. One 
example of this is HTML5 web storage, 
which gives a web app the ability to store 
large amounts of data locally. Future 
versions of HTML could even support 
further local features such as the device‚Äôs 
camera and fingerprint scanner.
‚ÄúCSS is used for styling, so the 
challenge of targeting mobile devices is 
catering for a smaller screen. CSS has 
accomplished this by making responsive 
web design possible, allowing websites to 
target many different screen sizes rather 
than just a desktop. If CSS is to avoid 
becoming irrelevant in the near future,  
it will need to continue to add new 
features and capabilities, which will give 
websites and web apps the ability to 
provide a visual experience that‚Äôs on a 
par with mobile apps.

Zeta developed an engaging ad campaign that showcased what it had to offer.

relation to the devices it will be used on 
to ensure its presented appropriately. 
‚ÄúOften, this process is an ever-
tightening, spiral workflow of planning, 
designing, testing, and iterating, which is 
repeated until the process satisfies all 
aesthetic and functional requirements. 
Responsive design is something our 
customers expect and has simply 
become a natural part of our overall 
workflow. Because we‚Äôre addressing 
responsive design right from the offset 
(using rapid prototyping), we‚Äôre 
investigating mobile user flow in parallel 
with desktop, before development starts.
‚ÄúMaking use of software, Sketch and 
Axure, we‚Äôre able to fully explore the 
breakpoints for different devices. 
Animated and dynamic elements help us 
understand the full story and ensure 
we‚Äôre equipped with all the info we need 
before development begins.‚Äù
Anna concludes: ‚ÄúWhilst using a fully 
responsive solution may require more 
resource and time early in the planning 
and design process, it pays back during 
the development process. During the 
development process a clear 
understanding of the holistic plan  
can be more fully understood ‚Äì not to 
mention the cost and time advantages  
of running an entirely separate app for 
mobile, which may have dedicated  
pages and possibly a database. With a 
fully responsive solution, we keep 
ongoing maintenance and security costs 
down whilst ensuring professional 
consistency for all our clients‚Äô brands.‚Äù
To deliver the high-quality work Zeta 
has become known for requires high 
calibre staff. As Craig succinctly tells Web 
Designer: ‚ÄúOur organisation is only as 
good as our team.‚Äù A level of inherent skill 
is important but, as Craig continues, 
understanding what drives each 
candidate Zeta interviews is much more 
important when finding the next person 
to join the team.
‚ÄúWe understand that most people 
don‚Äôt feel comfortable during the 
interview process, so our management 
team draw out the important information 
from candidates. Obviously, skills are 
important, but on top of this we are 
looking for self-motivated team players 
who are eager to progress their own 
abilities, solve problems and have  
a strong drive. 
‚ÄúAlso, we suggest if you are invited  
to attend an interview, always research 
the agency and ask lots of pertinent 
questions when prompted. Experience is 
very important. We recommend anyone 
who hasn‚Äôt got much working experience 
to get themselves on internships, online 
projects, courses or work experience.

MARVEL VIDEO SEO 
mouser.com/empowerin -innovation
Mouser creates a series 
of high-quality YouTube 
videos regarding space 
exploration, home 
automation and 
driverless cars. Grant 
Imahara from the 
Mythbusters was brought 
in to head up presenting.
For one specific series, 
Mouser partnered with 
Marvel to create viral 
YouTube videos around 
the Avengers‚Äô films. Zeta 
was tasked with online 
video promotion and 
managing their SEO to 
ensure their videos were 
accessible and reaching 
the right audience.
The strategy focused 
on promoting video 
content with blog 
content, referrer 
websites and targeting 
key phrases in YouTube 
and Google. Articles with 
the videos embedded on 
were created and posted 
on relevant publications 
and blogs. Titles and 
descriptions were also 
optimised with key 
phrases to help the 
videos be found in 
Google Web Search.
After the marketing 
success of this campaign, 
it was expanded to 
include the other Mouser 
YouTube series which 
were being produced.
And the results? For 15 
targeted key phrases, 
Mouser videos ranked on 
page one of Google web 
search. The videos also 
appeared on the first 
page of Google video 
search for 40 different 
key phrases. And in total, 
the YouTube videos 
amassed over 4,500,000 
views, 44,000 likes and 
2,143 comments.
Above For this project Zeta built creative content 
that got high profile trendsetters to share and 
mention the video. SEO was also carried out  
on YouTube and Google.
Below The video content 
produced around the Avengers‚Äô 
films needed Zeta‚Äôs expertise to 
reach its target audience.
‚ÄúWe truly value our staff which is why it 
is vital that our working environment is 
pleasurable. The essence of a successful 
business is that the people actually  
enjoy coming to work and have time to 
develop their skills whilst being here too.  
We think that our success is directly 
linked to our location and lifestyle. We are 
only two hours by train from Waterloo 
with a five-minute walk to the station but 
much more importantly, Poole Harbour is 
only minutes away.‚Äù
To meet the needs of its expansion, 
Zeta is now remodelling its Poole office 
space, as you read this.. The agency‚Äôs 
trajectory is clear: with a deep 
understanding of not only the digital 
spaces it designs for, but also an 
appreciation of how communications  
is shaped by today‚Äôs digital channels,  
Zeta is the maker of the environments  
we all live within.

Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to present an automatic sliding quotes box that can be easily updated
Create a visually  
dynamic sliding quotes box
1. Initiate HTML document
The first step is to initiate the document that will define 
the HTML page. This consists of a HTML container that 
stores the head and body sections. While the head 
section stores links to external CSS and JavaScript, the 
body section will store the visible content created in the 
next step.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Quotes List</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
href="styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="code.
js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  *** STEP 2 HERE
</body>
</html>
2. HTML content
The page content consists of a container labelled with a 
'data-player' attribute. This container stores the individual 
quote elements ‚Äì represented as span elements. Each of 
these contain the content for the individual quotes; this 
example uses a h3 title followed by a paragraph element. 
This structure‚Äôs presentation will be controlled via the 
JavaScript and CSS.
<div data-player>
  <span>
  <h3>Title 1</h3>
  <p>Text...</p>
  </span>
  <span>
  <h3>Title 2</h3>
  <p>Text...</p>
  </span>
  <span>
  <h3>Title 3</h3>
  <p>Text...</p>
  </span>
</span>
3. JavaScript initiation
Create a new file called 'code.js'. This file starts with the 
initiation of two features: a 'quote' variable used to 
describe the current quote to show, along with a function 
to update the quote. The updateQuote function searches 
for all quotes inside 'data-player' and updates their 
'data-status' to be 'shown' or if their index position 
matches the 'quote' variable. The quote variable is then 
updated for the next time updateQuote is called.
var quote = 0;
function updateQuote(){
  var nodes = document.
querySelectorAll("[data-player] > *");
  for(var i=0; i<nodes.length; i++){
  if(i == quote)nodes[i].
setAttribute("data-status","visible");
  else nodes[i].setAttribute("data-
status","");
  }
  if(quote < nodes.length-1)quote++;
  else quote = 0;
}
4. Load event
The last part of the JavaScript code defines what 
happens after the page has completed loading. The 
page‚Äôs quote display needs to be updated immediately, 
hence the call of the updateQuote function. This 
updateQuote function is also called every 6,000 
milliseconds (six seconds) through the use of the 
setInterval instruction.
window.addEventListener("load", function()
{
  updateQuote();
  setInterval(updateQuote,6000);
});
5. Initiate CSS
With the JavaScript complete, create a new file called 
'styles.css'. The first rule in this file sets the HTML 
container and its body section to display across the full 
size of the browser window. A black background with 
white text is also applied, along with elimination of visible 
border spacing.
html,body{
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
}
6. Quote player
The container for the quotes allows for consistent control 
of each quote. As well as needing to have a size and 
default font size, relative positioning is applied so that the 
inner child items can be positioned in relation to 
wherever this parent container is located. This container 
is referenced via its 'data-player' attribute.
[data-player]{
  position: relative;
  width: 20em;
  font-size: 2em;
}
7. Quote items
Each of the quotes are child items inside the 'data-player' 
container. These children are set to display with the 
attributes they should animate towards when they 
disappear from view. This is set at 10em from the top of 
the container with opacity set to invisible. Any changes 
appear animated due to the applied transition rule.
[data-player] > *{
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  top: 10em;
  left: 0;
  border: 1px solid #fff;
  padding: .5em;
  width: 100%;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: all 1s;
}
8. Visible status
The quote item selected via JavaScript‚Äôs updateQuote 
function has a 'data-status' attribute set to 'visible'. This 
allows CSS to set a separate presentation rule to the 
other quote items. In this case, opacity is set to full 
visibility, as well as the vertical position being set to the 
top of the parent container.
[data-player] > [data-status="visible"]{
  opacity: 1;
  top: 0;
}

Use HTML and CSS to create a background effect that will help draw attention to specific content
Create an animated content 
background ping effect
1. Initiate HTML document
The first step is to create the HTML document that's 
responsible for storing the page details and its content. 
The document has an HTML container, which stores a 
head and body section. While the head section‚Äôs primary 
purpose is to link the external CSS file to the page, the 
body section will be used in Step 2 to store the visible 
page content.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Background Ping</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
href="styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
  *** STEP 2 HERE
</body>
</html>
2. Page content
The page content consists of a main container for the 
primary page content, followed by a container for the  
‚Äòping‚Äô effect. The ping container requires an inner 
element to be controlled as the visible circle element.  
For SEO purposes, the ping container is placed at the 
bottom of the HTML.
<main>
  <h1>Content</h1>
</main>
<span class="ping"><span></span></span>
3. CSS initiation
With the HTML now complete, create a new file called 
‚Äòstyles.css‚Äô. The first step for the CSS is to define the 
HTML and body containers. These need to cover the  
full browser window, along with having their default 
colours set. Margins and paddings are set to guarantee 
no visible border spacing.
html,body{
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  color: #fff;
  background: rgb(21, 34, 47);
}
4. Main content
The page‚Äôs primary content inside the main container 
needs to be placed above the animated background. 
This is achieved using absolute positioning so that a 
z-index of one can be applied. Left and top attributes are 
also applied so that the container is guaranteed to be 
positioned in the top-left corner.
main{
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
5. Ping container
The ping container is required to be positioned in the 
top-left corner. A z-index of zero is applied, placing it 
below the main content container, meaning that the 
animation effect will not interfere with the primary 
content. Width/height are set to make the ping container 
cover the full size of the html/body container.
.ping{
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 0;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
6. Ping circle
The child element inside the ping container becomes the 
animated circle. This step applies attributes to set this 
element‚Äôs position to the top-left corner, sized to fit the 
full page and to have a solid red background colour. A 
‚Äòping‚Äô animation is also applied, set to repeat infinitely 
over a two-second duration.
.ping span{
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #c00;
  animation: ping 2s infinite;
}
7. Animate ping
The ping animation sets the previous step to display as a 
circle at the centre of the container. This animation starts 
from invisibly positioned in the middle of the screen, 
upon which it appears at full opacity. The animation 
progresses towards displaying the circle to cover the full 
screen at zero opacity ‚Äì that is, fading out.
@keyframes ping {
  0%{
  -webkit-clip-path: circle(0% at center);
  -moz-clip-path: circle(0% at center);
  clip-path: circle(0% at center);
  opacity: 0;
  }
  10%{ opacity: 1}
  100%{
  -webkit-clip-path: circle(30% at 
center);
  -moz-clip-path: circle(30% at center);
  clip-path: circle(30% at center);
  opacity: 0;
  }
}

Implement  a glitch  
effect on hover 
Inspired by https://vintage.agency
82 _____________________________________________workshop
Interactive prompt
The user is prompted to scroll
down the screen by an
animated line at the bottom of
the screen, which shows there
is more content available.
Visible menu
The menu is available in the top
right hand corner, and the bottom
right corner has a link ready to take
users right into the Portfolio.
Animated logo
The Vintage logo is based on a stylised
V shape and it is recreated on the site
by being made up of points that
animate and move with
interconnected lines and polygons.
Glitch text effect
Every once in a while, or when
the user rolls their mouse over
the text, the text gets some
glitch effects that break up the
text with animated rectangles.
Site branding
The site branding remains
visible on the screen and shows
the main logo of the V in situ
with the name. This helps to
establish the animated version
in the main display.

Implement aglitcheffectonhover
1. Creating a simple glitch effect
Creating a simple glitch effect can be done in so many 
different ways. Here we are going to do it by having an 
animated GIF over the top of the text, which will be 
turned on and off in the display. First up, add this code to 
the body tag of your page.
<div id=‚Äùholder‚Äù onmouseover=‚Äùglitch()‚Äù>
<div id=‚Äùglitch‚Äù></div>
WEB
<br> PRODUCT-
<br> ION
</div>
2. Styling the display
The content will use a specific typeface from Google 
Fonts called Work Sans. Grab the link from there and 
place it in your head section; then add the CSS to either 
style tags or a separate CSS file. The page is made black 
with white text and the holder is styled up for the text.
body {
background: #000;
font-family: ‚ÄòWork Sans‚Äô, sans-serif;
color: #fff;
}  
#holder {
font-size: 6em;
width: 500px;
height: 300px;
margin: 0 auto;
position: relative;
}
3. Displaying the glitch
The glitch effect is going to be a background image that 
is placed directly over the top of the text. The important 
part here is that it is made invisible by reducing the 
opacity to zero so that it doesn‚Äôt show up until the user 
interacts with the text.
#glitch {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
z-index: 10;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
background: url(glitch.gif);
opacity: 0;
}
4. Hold everything
Add script tags to the end of the body section and create 
a cached reference to the ‚Äòglitch‚Äô div in the document. 
Then a variable named ‚Äòover‚Äô is set to false. This will be 
turned on and off when the user moves over the text.
var gl = document.getElementById(‚Äúglitch‚Äù);
var over = false;
5. Running the glitch
The glitch function is called when the mouse moves over 
the text. If the glitch is not running then the glitch visibility 
is turned on and it is turned off after one and a half 
seconds. You can experiment with this and use a random 
number to make it more unpredictable.
function glitch() {
if (over == false) {
gl.style.opacity = ‚Äú1‚Äù;
setTimeout(function() {
normal();
}, 1500);
}
}
6. Back to normality
The glitch effect should not stay on as it would be too 
annoying to the user, but as an interactive element it 
works well. Here, the code resets the opacity back to zero 
so that it isn‚Äôt visible over the top of the text.
function normal() {
gl.style.opacity = ‚Äú0‚Äù; 
}

tutorial _________________________________________________85
ost web designers are constantly
looking for ways to add a big
impact to their site designs, as
directed by clients to grab their
users‚Äô attention. This has evolved over the years from
using a header graphic, to a slideshow under the menu.
This later became full browser width, and now the vast
majority of sites follow that same format. The sites that
win ‚Äòsite of the day‚Äô on the different web awards sites
generally try and do something that is a little more
unique than just having a giant slideshow. WebGL is great
for this as adding something interactive can really grab
the users‚Äô attention and show that this isn‚Äôt the same as
the other sites they‚Äôve just visited.
To make a splash in this tutorial, a liquid, reflective
surface will be added and this will be animated towards
the camera with rolling waves moving forward. There will
also be particles that will move forward to complete the
look and feel. In the centre will be the site‚Äôs logo, and the
whole scene will react to the user‚Äôs mouse movement so
that the content shifts and makes the 3D really stand out.
The logo is just a transparent PNG so this can easily be
customised to your own design. The lights will also
animate so that the colours will orbit around and highlight
the different waves within the scene.
1.Initialvariables
Open the start folder from the project files and drag this
into your code editor. Open ‚Äòindex.html‚Äô and you will see
that the JavaScript libraries have already been linked up
for you. Inside the empty script tags is where the code will
go. Here WebGL is detected to make sure the project can
be run, then a whole range of variables are added that will
be used in the scene.
if (!Detector.webgl) Detector.
addGetWebGLMessage();
var SCREEN_WIDTH = window.innerWidth;
var SCREEN_HEIGHT = window.innerHeight;
var renderer, camera, scene, moverGroup, 
floorGeometry, floorMaterial, pointLight, 
pointLight2, pGeometry;
var FLOOR_RES = 60;
var FLOOR_HT = 650;
var stepCount = 0;
var noiseScale = 9.5;
var noiseSeed = Math.random() * 100;
2.Morevariables
The next block of variables handle how large the water
floor should be and the speed that it will move along with
initial mouse positions. The centre of the screen is worked
out and the improved noise library is being used to create
the surface of the water.
var FLOOR_WIDTH = 3600;
var FLOOR_DEPTH = 4800;
var MOVE_SPD = 1.9;
var mouseX = 0;
var mouseY = 0;
var windowHalfX = window.innerWidth / 2;
var windowHalfY = window.innerHeight / 2;
var snoise = new ImprovedNoise();
var textureLoader = new THREE.
TextureLoader();
3.Calculatingthemouse
Some final variables are added for the post processing
effects of the scene. An event listener is added that
checks the mouse movement. The scene is going to
move in the display port to react to mouse movement.
The function that is added here works out the amount of
movement being allowed.
4.Postprocessingsettings
The ‚Äòparams‚Äô function is where all the settings for the post 
processing effects will be stored. If you need to change 
anything, this is the place to do it. The tilt shift blur is 
covered in the first four lines, then the film pass in the 
remaining lines. This is mainly for the screen intensity and 
noise intensity.
M
5.Finalparameters
The last of the parameters is for the dark vignette around
the edge of the screen. The ‚Äòinit‚Äô and ‚Äòanimate‚Äô functions
are called to run. The ‚Äòanimate‚Äô function will be created
much later in the tutorial, but the ‚Äòinit‚Äô function is created
here. The camera and scene are set up to allow viewing of
the 3D content.
effectVignette.uniforms[‚Äúoffset‚Äù].value =
1.0;
effectVignette.uniforms[‚Äúdarkness‚Äù].value
= 1.3;
}
init();
animate();
function init() {
camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70,
window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1,
4000);
camera.position.z = 2750;
scene = new THREE.Scene();
scene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0x1c3c4a,
0.00045);
6.Lettingthelightin
In order to see the content of the scene, four lights will be
placed. The first is a hemisphere light, which is used just to
get the basic ambience of the scene. Next up is the centre
light that is adding a light blue light in the middle of the
scene. This is set off to one side in order to give some light
to the whole scene.
var hemisphereLight = new THREE.
HemisphereLight(0xe3feff, 0xe6ddc8, 0.7);
scene.add(hemisphereLight);
WebGL scene basics
A basic WebGL scene needs three things to 
make it work: a scene to hold everything, 
something to see in the scene such as a model, 
and finally lights to illuminate that model.
Tutorials

When the first liquid surface is added the reflection map 
on this is very obvious and the fog helps blend the 
background and surface together
Top
Floating particles fill out the scene, and when all of this is 
animated in the render function, it brings a sense of 
movement towards the camera

86 _________________________________________________tutorial
hemisphereLight.position.y = 300;
var centerLight = new THREE.
SpotLight(0xb7f9ff, 1);
scene.add(centerLight);
centerLight.position.set(2500, 300, 2000);
centerLight.penumbra = 1;
centerLight.decay = 5;
7. Animated lights
The next two lights to be added. ‚ÄòPointLight‚Äô and 
‚ÄòPointLight2‚Äô are coloured lights that will circle in opposite 
directions around the scene so that the light changes 
constantly in the view. The first is a pink light and the 
second is an orange light. The path and format for the 
reflection images are set in the last two lines.
pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xe07bff, 
1.5);
pointLight.position.z = 200;
scene.add(pointLight);
pointLight2 = new THREE.PointLight(0xff4e00, 
1.2);
pointLight2.position.z = 200;
scene.add(pointLight2);
var path = ‚Äúimg/‚Äù;
var format = ‚Äò.jpg‚Äô;
8. Shiny surfaces
The liquid surface will have a reflective, shiny surface and 
this is done by creating a reflection cube. This is a cube 
with a 360-degree skybox placed inside it, which will be 
reflected onto the surface of the liquid. The ‚Äòurls‚Äô array 
contains the images to be loaded, then the material  
is set up.
9. Setting up some groups
The mover group will contain some particles that will be 
Createlushliquid effects with WebGL
added later, while the floor group will contain the surface 
of the liquid. A new 3D object is created that will hold that 
surface. There will be two liquid surfaces; one will have the 
reflective material and the second will have the wireframe 
‚ÄòfloorMaterial‚Äô, as defined here.
moverGroup = new THREE.Object3D();
scene.add(moverGroup);
var floorGroup = new THREE.Object3D();
var floorMaterial = new THREE.
MeshPhongMaterial({
color: 0xeeeeee, side: THREE.DoubleSide, 
blending: THREE.AdditiveBlending, wireframe: 
true
});
floorGeometry = new THREE.
PlaneGeometry(FLOOR_WIDTH + 1200, FLOOR_
DEPTH, FLOOR_RES, FLOOR_RES); 
10. Making the surfaces
The two liquid surfaces are created here as ‚ÄòfloorMesh‚Äô 
and ‚ÄòfloorMesh2‚Äô. They are positioned and placed inside 
the ‚ÄòfloorGroup‚Äô then rotated to a good viewing angle in 
front of the camera. This isn‚Äôt directly flat, but slightly 
angled as it looks better like that.
var floorMesh = new THREE.
Mesh(floorGeometry, cubeMaterial);
var floorMesh2 = new THREE.
Mesh(floorGeometry, floorMaterial);
floorMesh2.position.y = 20;
floorMesh2.position.z = 5;
floorGroup.add(floorMesh);
floorGroup.add(floorMesh2);
scene.add(floorGroup);
floorMesh.rotation.x = Math.PI / 1.65;
floorMesh2.rotation.x = Math.PI / 1.65;
floorGroup.position.y = 180; 
11. Adding floating particles
The section of code here creates an empty geometry 
object and then places into it 2,000 vertices that act as 
the particles. These are distributed at random positions 
on the X, Y and Z axis. These will float just above the 
surface of the liquid floor.
pGeometry = new THREE.Geometry();
sprite = textureLoader.load(‚Äúimg/sprite.
png‚Äù);
for (i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {
  var vertex = new THREE.Vector3();
  vertex.x = 4000 * Math.random() - 2000;
  vertex.y = -200 + Math.random() * 700;
  vertex.z = 5000 * Math.random() - 2000;
  pGeometry.vertices.push(vertex);
}
12. Creating the look
The material defined here will set how the particles look. 
An image was loaded in the previous step and that is 
used as the image on each particle, once the material is 
created. This is then applied to each point of the 
geometry for all of the particles. These are then added 
into the scene.
 
13. Adding the logo
A logo will be placed into the centre of the screen and this 
will be added onto a flat plane that will face the camera. 
The logo is made slightly transparent and given an 
additive blend so that it is more visible when lighter 
objects pass behind it. This is positioned and placed into 
the scene.
sprite = textureLoader.load(‚Äúimg/logo.png‚Äù);
geometry = new THREE.
PlaneBufferGeometry(500, 640, 1);
material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({
  transparent: true, opacity: 0.8, blending: 
THREE.AdditiveBlending, map: sprite, side: 
THREE.DoubleSide
});
var plane = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, 
material);
plane.position.set(0, 70, 1800);
scene.add(plane);
14. Adding the render settings
The renderer is set up to have smooth, anti-aliased edges 
Top 
Adding in the logo, which is a transparent PNG image, places 
this in the centre of the scene, and is easy to replace with your 
own logo later.
Right
Every so often one of the post processing effects runs a 
glitch effect on the screen just to liven up and distort the 
screen, before returning to normal.
Logo light effects
By making the logo a ‚Äòdouble sided‚Äô material, the 
lights affect it on the front and back as they move 
around the scene.

way. Those furthest away from the camera will be large, 
then the sides will be slightly less, and those nearest the 
camera will be scaled the least. This makes the back and 
sides slightly more interesting to look at.
  if ((i > 30) || (j < 12) || (j > 48)) {
  floorGeometry.vertices[i * (FLOOR_RES + 1) 
+ j].z = snoise.noise(ipos / FLOOR_RES * 
noiseScale, j / FLOOR_RES * noiseScale, 
noiseSeed) * FLOOR_HT;
  } else if (i > 25 && i < 30) {
  floorGeometry.vertices[i * (FLOOR_RES + 1) 
+ j].z = snoise.noise(ipos / FLOOR_RES * 
noiseScale, j / FLOOR_RES * noiseScale, 
noiseSeed) * (FLOOR_HT / 1.2);
  } else {
  floorGeometry.vertices[i * (FLOOR_RES + 1) 
+ j].z = snoise.noise(ipos / FLOOR_RES * 
noiseScale, j / FLOOR_RES * noiseScale, 
noiseSeed) * (FLOOR_HT / 2);
  }
  }
  }
  floorGeometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true;
}
19. Resizing and animating
When the window is resized, the function here is called 
from the listener that was set up in step 16. The camera, 
renderer and composer are all reset in here to match the 
new dimensions of the window of the browser. The 
animate function just sets itself at 60fps, calling the 
render function to update the display.
function onWindowResize() {
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / 
window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, 
and now the background colour is set. This is added into 
the body of the document so that the scene is on the 
HTML page. The post processing effects are set up by 
having various render and shader passes initialised.
15. Making the pass
Once the film and glitch pass are added, an effect 
composer is created that composes all of the passes 
together. These are added one by one to the composer 
and it will eventually be rendered out to the screen for 
audience display.
16. Closing the ‚Äòinit‚Äô function
The last few settings are added for the initialisation of the 
scene. The parameters for post processing are set, the 
setting of the waves is called and an event listener is 
added for whenever the browser is resized. This enables 
the display to be updated to fit the new dimensions.
17. Setting up the waves
The waves are created now for the surface of the liquid. 
This is done by moving through each vertex of the floor 
geometry on the x and z axis and moving it upward on 
the y axis. At this stage the ‚Äòfor‚Äô loops are created for the 
x and z axis.
function setWaves() {
  stepCount++;
  moverGroup.position.z = -MOVE_SPD;
  var i, ipos;
  var offset = stepCount * MOVE_SPD / 
FLOOR_DEPTH * FLOOR_RES;
  for (i = 0; i < FLOOR_RES + 1; i++) {
  for (var j = 0; j < FLOOR_RES + 1; j++) {
  ipos = i + offset;
18. Making waves
Not all the vertices will be scaled upwards in the same 
Getting a good looking 3D
scene is not just about the
content that goes into the 
scene. Sure, a great looking 3D 
model will always look good 
on screen, but part of the way 
it can be enhanced and made 
to look even better is through 
post processing. What this 
does is take the entire screen 
display and run it through a 
shader. A shader is a very fast 
process that runs on your 
graphics card where all the 
pixels are affected at once 
with what the shader has been 
told to do. This scene uses five 
shaders. The first two are the 
tilt shift, so a shader is run for 
both horizontal and vertical 
blur. Then a slight film grain is 
added, a vignette and finally 
an occasional glitch effect. If 
you want to learn more about 
shaders check out https://
thebookofshaders.com.
window.innerHeight);
  composer.setSize(window.innerWidth, 
window.innerHeight);
}
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  render(); 
}
20. Every frame of action
The render function is called every frame. The point lights 
are set to orbit around in the scene and the camera is 
positioned according to the mouse movement, with a 
little easing so that it moves gradually into place. The 
camera is set to always look at the centre of the scene.
function render() {
  var timer = -0.0002 * Date.now();
  pointLight.position.x = 2400 * Math.
cos(timer);
  pointLight.position.z = 2400 * Math.
sin(timer);
  pointLight2.position.x = 1800 * Math.
cos(-timer * 1.5);
  pointLight2.position.z = 1800 * Math.
sin(-timer * 1.5);
  camera.position.x += (mouseX - camera.
position.x) * .05;
  camera.position.y += (-mouseY - camera.
position.y) * .05;
  camera.lookAt(scene.position);
21. Final steps
In the final step the particles are moved forward on their 
individual vertex, and if they get to the camera, they are 
placed back into the distance. This is updated and the 
setWaves function is called to make the waves roll 
forward. The scene is rendered by the effects composer.

Each of the navigation images require an image to be 
associated with their ‚Äòbefore‚Äô element. The ‚Äònth-child‚Äô

The navigation element is defined with HTML5‚Äôs nav 
container to store the individual link items. Each of the 
links has the visible text wrapped inside a span element. 
This approach provides the ability for CSS to reference 
while keeping the HTML clean.
<nav>
<a href=‚Äù#‚Äù><span>One</span></a>
<a href=‚Äù#‚Äù><span>Two</span></a>
<a href=‚Äù#‚Äù><span>Three</span></a>
</nav>
3. Initiate CSS stylesheet
With the HTML now complete, create a new file called 
‚Äòstyles.css‚Äô. The first rules in this file set the HTML 
container and its body to display across the full browser 
window/screen. A black background is also applied, along 
with a guarantee for no visible border spacing.
body,html {
display: block;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
background: #000;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
}
4. Navigation container
The navigation should be set to cover the full size of its 
parent element ‚Äì that is, the previously defined body. A 
display mode of table is also used so that the widths of its 
first level children can be automatically calculated.
nav{
display: table;
height: 100%;
width: 100%;
}
5. Navigation links
Each of the navigation links act as a container for 
addition child content ‚Äì a span element in this case. We 
want automatic calculation of their width, hence a 
‚Äòtable-cell‚Äô display mode. They are also set to cover the 
full height of their parent.
nav a{
position: relative;
display: table-cell;
height: 100%;
color: #fff;
font-size: 3em;
overflow: hidden; 
}
6. Image preparation
CSS allows every element to have an associated ‚Äúbefore‚Äù 
and ‚Äòafter‚Äô element to be created for HTML elements. This 
step defines the default size and positioning images 
associated with the links to be out of view. Transition is 
set to animate changes to bottom and opacity.
nav a::before{
position: absolute;
display: block;
content: ‚Äú‚Äù;
color: #000;
font-size: 1em;
bottom: -10em;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 75%;
background: no-repeat center center;
background-size: cover;
opacity: 0;
transition: bottom 1s, opacity .5s; 
}
7. Navigation link hover
Changes to hovered navigation links are defined using 
the ‚Äòhover‚Äô selector. Navigation containers have their 
colours changed, while the previously defined ‚Äòbefore‚Äô 
images have their opacity and vertical positioning set to 
become fully visible ‚Äì animated due to the transition 
defined in Step 6.
nav a:hover{
background: #fff;
Technique
Layout Design: Less is more
While adding visual effects may look appealing, it‚Äôs important to develop a 
content layout strategy that supports your content‚Äôs objectives. Consider how 
you can avoid overcomplicating your design to a point that distracts your 
visitors from navigating to the content you want them to read.

tutorial _________________________________________________ 91
ny kind of web form has an objective in
mind for its users, from something as
simple as sending a contact email, to
completing a complex financial
application. When the user achieves this objective, it‚Äôs
typically referred to as a ‚Äòconversion‚Äô in the analytics
world, with the total number of conversions showing
stakeholders how well the web form is performing.
As designers and developers, it‚Äôs our responsibility to
help the web form get as many conversions as possible.
One way to do this is to make its user experience (UX)
effective enough that the user can get from start to finish
frustration-free, no matter what device they‚Äôre using.
In this tutorial, we‚Äôll be building a simple web form with
a great UX in mind. We‚Äôll be optimising the form for
multiple screens and input types, refining the inputs on
show, as well as presenting the user with helpful
information to streamline their data entry.
To get started, download the files from Filesilo and
open ‚Äòwebsite-template‚Äô in your text editor. Then in
terminal, CD into ‚Äòwebsite-template‚Äô and run ‚Äònpm install‚Äô.
Next, run ‚Äònpm run watch‚Äô to build the project and watch
for any changes so that it can be rebuilt. Finally, open a
new terminal window and then run ‚Äònpm run serve‚Äô to
start up a dev server at ‚Äòlocalhost:8080‚Äô, which you
should open in a browser.
1.Addabasictextinput
From the Filesilo package, open ‚Äòsupport-files/step-01.txt‚Äô
and then copy and paste its content into your website
template file ‚Äòdev/index.html‚Äô, replacing the ‚ÄòForm goes
here‚Äô text. This enables the web form user to enter their
name using a simple text input.
2. Input validation overview
Let‚Äôs add real-time validation to any inputs with invalid 
values so they are flagged straight away. Replace the 
HTML added in the previous step with the HTML from 
‚Äòsupport-files/step-02.txt‚Äô. This adds the ‚Äòrequired‚Äô 
keyword, which triggers native DOM validation, and also 
A
5.Buildingvalidation
function‚Äìpart3
In the empty validation function, we‚Äôll get the error
container belonging to the input we‚Äôve passed to the
function using its ‚Äòdata-linked-input‚Äô attribute. If this
container element exists, and the native ‚ÄòcheckValidity‚Äô
function returns false, trigger the appropriate error state
on the input using the ‚Äòaria-invalid‚Äô attribute. Finally, we‚Äôll
then determine which message to show in the error
container element, based on the type of validation error
recorded in the input‚Äôs ‚Äòvalidity‚Äô object. If the error were
simply a missing value, the last ‚Äòelse‚Äô statement would
trigger and use the ‚Äòdata-required-text‚Äô error message.
let message = document.querySelector
(`[data-linked-input=‚Äô${input.name}‚Äô]`);
if(!input.checkValidity() && message) {
input.setAttribute(‚Äúaria-invalid‚Äù, ‚Äútrue‚Äù);
message.classList.add(‚Äúis-active‚Äù);
message.setAttribute(‚Äúaria-hidden‚Äù,
‚Äúfalse‚Äù);
if(input.validity.patternMismatch) {
message.innerText =
input.dataset.patternMismatchText;
}
else if(input.validity.typeMismatch) {
message.innerText =
input.dataset.typeMismatchText;
}
else {
message.innerText =
input.dataset.requiredText;
} }
Simplify and  
merge inputs
Where possible, try to merge related inputs so 
users have less to complete. An example would be 
‚ÄòTitle‚Äô, ‚ÄòFirst Name‚Äô, and ‚ÄòSurname‚Äô. This can be 
merged into one field called ‚ÄòName‚Äô and then 
programmatically separated after submission.

Most modern browsers with a web inspector have a 
device mode where you can easily simulate how your 
web form appears on mobile and tablet devices. In 
Google Chrome, this can be activated by clicking the 
mobile/tablet icon. It‚Äôs then just a matter of selecting  
your desired device. 
Top
It‚Äôs important that a web form is usable on the smallest 
320px device (For example: iPhone 5) to the largest 
desktop environment (Think iMacs, large monitors etc).
two new data attributes. The first one is called 
‚Äòdata-required-text‚Äô, and stores the error message to be 
displayed for a missing value. The second is called 
‚Äòdata-linked-input‚Äô, which contains the name of the input 
the error message container should link to.
3. Building validation  
function ‚Äì part 1
Add the snippet below to ‚Äòdev/js/main.js‚Äô. This builds the 
foundations of the validation function. Specifically, we‚Äôre 
grabbing all the inputs on the page and then, once the 
submit button is clicked, looping through and passing 
each one to the (currently) empty ‚Äòvalidate‚Äô function.
(function(){
  let inputs = document
  .querySelectorAll(‚Äúinput‚Äù), i,
  validate = function(input) {
  }
  document.querySelector(‚Äúbutton[type=‚Äôsubm
it‚Äô]‚Äù)
  .addEventListener(‚Äúclick‚Äù, function() {
  for(i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
  validate(inputs[i]);
  }
  document.querySelector
  (‚Äú[aria-invalid=‚Äôtrue‚Äô]‚Äù).focus();
  }); })();
4. Building validation  
function ‚Äì part 2
Next, add the code (see FileSilo) below underneath the 
submit button event listener. We‚Äôre looping through all 
inputs again and doing two things. First, adding an event 
listener for the ‚Äòinvalid‚Äô event, which cancels its default 
behaviour. This stops the browser‚Äôs default error message 
boxes from appearing. Second, we‚Äôre adding an event 
listener for the ‚Äòchange‚Äô event and then, when detected, 
passing the input to the validation function. This is how 
the real-time validation is triggered, as the change event 
fires when the input receives a value.

92__________________________________________________tutorial
6. Building validation  
function ‚Äì part 4
Add the below snippet after the previous step‚Äôs 
‚ÄòcheckValidity()‚Äô ‚Äòif‚Äô statement. This adds logic so when an 
input passes validation, the input‚Äôs error state is removed, 
alongside any error messages.
else if(message) {
  input.setAttribute(‚Äúaria-invalid‚Äù, ‚Äúfalse‚Äù);
  message.classList.remove(‚Äúis-active‚Äù);
  message.innerText = ‚Äú‚Äù;
  message.setAttribute(‚Äúaria-hidden‚Äù, ‚Äútrue‚Äù);
}
7. Add date of birth inputs
Copy the HTML from ‚Äòsupport-files/step-07.txt‚Äô and add it 
just after the name input. You may notice a ‚Äòpattern‚Äô 
attribute in use here. This accepts a regex pattern, which 
the DOM validation uses to check if our input‚Äôs value is in 
the desired format. In this case, checking if only two 
numbers are entered for ‚Äòday‚Äô and ‚Äòmonth‚Äô, and four 
numbers for ‚Äòyear‚Äô. If a match isn‚Äôt found, the text within 
the input‚Äôs ‚Äòdata-pattern-mismatch-text‚Äô attribute is used 
as the error message, as per Step 5.
8. Improve date of birth inputs
Let‚Äôs add some functionality specifically for date-of-birth 
inputs to ‚Äòdev/js/main.js‚Äô, so when you enter a value in 
either day or month which matches its expected length, 
the focus automatically transitions to the next input. 
(function() {
   var inputs = document.querySelectorAll
   (‚Äú#bday-day, #bday-month‚Äù);
  for(var i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
  inputs[i].addEventListener
Buildawebform with great UX
  (‚Äúinput‚Äù, function(){
  if(this.value.length === 2) {
  this.nextElementSibling.focus();
  }
  });
  } })();
9. Add contact number input
Below the date-of-birth inputs, add the HTML from 
‚Äòsupport-files/step-09.txt‚Äô. This adds a contact number 
field and an accompanying tooltip, which contains a 
statement clarifying how this data will be used.
10. Add tooltip functionality
At the moment, clicking the tooltip makes the message 
show, but as soon as the focus changes to the next 
element it vanishes. Let‚Äôs add some JavaScript so when 
the info icon is clicked, the tooltip shows until the user 
clicks it again. Add the snippet below to ‚Äòdev/js/main.js‚Äô.
(function(){
  let tooltips = document.
  querySelectorAll(‚Äú.c-tooltip‚Äù), i;
  for(i = 0; i < tooltips.length; i++) {
  tooltips[i].addEventListener
  (‚Äúclick‚Äù, function() {
  this.classList.toggle(‚Äúis-active‚Äù);
  });
  tooltips[i].addEventListener
  (‚Äúkeypress‚Äù, function(e){
  if(e.which === 13) {
  this.classList.toggle(‚Äúis-active‚Äù);
  }
  });
  } })();
11. Add a secondary contact 
number input
Just below the contact number input‚Äôs error container, 
add the HTML from ‚Äòsupport-files/step-11.txt‚Äô. This adds  
an optional additional contact number input to the web 
form, which is only displayed if the user clicks the ‚ÄòAdd a 
backup number‚Äô link.
12. Add email address input
Next, we‚Äôll add a new input to capture the user‚Äôs email 
address. Add its HTML from ‚Äòsupport-files/step-12.txt‚Äô 
below the two contact numbers. Some types of inputs 
already have validation rules associated with them by 
default, so they don‚Äôt require a pattern attribute. For 
example, with an email input, the ‚Äòtype-mismatch‚Äô error 
gets triggered when its value isn‚Äôt formatted like an email 
address. Add the attribute below to the input and its value 
will be used as the error message whenever a 
type-mismatch error occurs.
data-type-mismatch-text=‚ÄùYour email address 
isn‚Äôt valid‚Äù
13. Add radio inputs
Let‚Äôs introduce some radio inputs to the web form 
through a multiple choice question. It‚Äôs HTML can be 
found in ‚Äòsupport-files/step-13.txt‚Äô and should be added 
below the email address input.
14. Improve form accessibility 
Can users who need to browse the Internet with a 
keyboard successfully use the form? Currently, the 
answer is no, since they can‚Äôt select any of the radio 
buttons. To change this, let‚Äôs add some JavaScript to ‚Äòdev/
js/main.js‚Äô so when a user presses the Enter key on an 
in-focus radio button, it selects it.
15. Add optional question field
Let‚Äôs add another text input, which in the next step we‚Äôll 
use as a vehicle to demonstrate a UX improvement. For 
now, let‚Äôs just add its HTML to ‚Äòindex.html‚Äô after the 
previous radio button inputs. As with the secondary 
contact number, it‚Äôs labelled as an optional field since 
most other inputs are required.
<div class=‚Äùu-margin-bottom-reduced‚Äù>
  <div class=‚Äùu-margin-bottom-tiny‚Äù>
  <label class=‚Äùc-type-charlie u-bold‚Äù
  for=‚Äùalien-movie‚Äù>
  Your favourite alien movie?
  <em>(Optional)</em>
  </label>
Above and right 
When multiple call-to-action buttons are present on a form, 
it‚Äôs important to think about their colours. Here, both 
‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô and ‚ÄòGo Back‚Äô have the same blue background, 
and, therefore, the same level of prominence. 
In this second screenshot, only the ‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô button has 
the blue background, whilst the ‚ÄòGo Back‚Äô button has a less 
prominent grey background. This establishes a visual 
hierarchy in the user‚Äôs mind, and conveys that ‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô is 
the more important action, which in this context is what 
we want them to think.
Using whitespace
Be sure to add some whitespace around inputs to 
help users distinguish one input from the next. If 
inputs are too close together, it can be visually 
overwhelming ‚Äì similar to reading a big block of  
text without paragraphs.

Build a web form withgreatUX
percentage complete value for its text content and bar 
width. This is done by comparing the current number of 
valid required inputs against the total number of required 
inputs. In ‚Äòdev/js/main.js‚Äô, add the following snippet to grab 
references to elements we‚Äôll be using.
(function() {
  let progressBar = document.
  querySelector(‚Äú.js-progress-bar‚Äù),
  progressBarPercentage = document.
  querySelector(‚Äú.js-progress-bar-
percentage‚Äù),
  inputs = document.
  querySelectorAll(‚Äúinput[required]‚Äù), i,
  totalList = [],
  validList = [];
  for(i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {}
})();
21. Count total required inputs
Next, let‚Äôs determine the total number of required  
inputs using the ‚Äòinputs‚Äô variable from the previous  
step. Rather than simply counting the length property  
of the ‚Äòinputs‚Äô variable, we‚Äôre creating a new array 
containing the names of all these inputs. This is to 
account for groups of radio inputs, which are all part  
of the same question. Add the below snippet to the 
empty ‚Äòfor‚Äô loop from the previous step.
if(totalList.indexOf(inputs[i].name) === -1){
  totalList.push(inputs[i].name); }
22. Update progress bar
Next, we‚Äôll add a change event listener to each required 
input, which will trigger a progress bar update once the 
user enters a new value. As mentioned in Step 20, this 
requires a percentage complete value, which we can now
calculate by populating the ‚ÄòvalidList array‚Äô with the 
names of any currently valid inputs, and then comparing
its length against the length of the ‚ÄòtotalList‚Äô array. Below 
the ‚Äòif‚Äô statement from the previous step, add the snippet 
of code shown.
  </div>
  <input type=‚Äùtext‚Äù id=‚Äùalien-movie‚Äù
  name=‚Äùalien-movie‚Äù class=
  ‚Äúc-input-text u-margin-bottom-small‚Äù
  placeholder=‚ÄùEg: Plan 9 from Outer Space‚Äù>
</div>
16. Add popular responses HTML
Adding the Step 16 (see FileSilo) snippet underneath Step 
15‚Äôs input element adds a new section called ‚ÄòPopular 
Responses‚Äô. The thinking behind this functionality is that it 
provides a helpful list of common responses (In a live app, 
this would be data driven) to give the user possible 
answers they could use.  Each <li> element represents a 
new option, so add as many as you want.
17. Add popular responses logic
Next, we need to add the logic for the popular responses 
functionality. This is done by adding a click event listener 
to all elements with the ‚Äòdata-popular-response‚Äô attribute, 
and then using the attribute‚Äôs value to find and then 
update the correct input element in the DOM. Add the 
snippet from FileSilo to ‚Äòdev/js/main.js‚Äô.
18. Supporting autocomplete
Many modern browsers are smart enough to analyse a 
web form‚Äôs inputs and match any stored autocomplete 
data. It‚Äôs not perfect, though, and occasionally makes 
mistakes. Let‚Äôs make this process easier for browsers by 
including autocomplete for some attributes.
19. Adding a progress bar
Now we‚Äôve added all the form‚Äôs inputs, another way we 
can improve the general UX is by adding a progress bar, 
which displays a percentage complete value based on 
the amount of required inputs with valid values. Between 
the <header> and <main> elements.
20. Progress bar logic
To make the progress bar work, we need to calculate a 
inputs[i].addEventListener
(‚Äúchange‚Äù, function() {
  if(this.getAttribute
  (‚Äúaria-invalid‚Äù) === ‚Äúfalse‚Äù &&
  validList.indexOf(this.name) === -1) {
  validList.push(this.name);
  }
  else if(this.getAttribute
  (‚Äúaria-invalid‚Äù) === ‚Äútrue‚Äù && 
  validList.indexOf(this.name) !== -1) {
  validList.splice
  (validList.indexOf(this.name), 1);
  }
  let percentage = Math.round(validList.
length
  / totalList.length * 100) + ‚Äò%‚Äô;
  progressBar.style.width = percentage;
  progressBarPercentage
  .innerText = percentage;
});
23. Make progress bar  
stick to viewport
Let‚Äôs add some finishing touches to the now working 
progress bar. By adding a ‚Äòc-sticky-container‚Äô class to the 
‚Äò<aside>‚Äô element, this will add a ‚Äòposition:sticky‚Äô CSS 
property, which means the element stays at the top of the 
viewport once the user scrolls past its initial placement.
If you then open ‚Äòdev/sass/components/_components.
progress-bar.scss‚Äô and add the code snippet below to  
the bottom, the text portion of the progress bar will be 
hidden on smaller devices in landscape view, freeing  
up more screen real estate.
@include mq($until: md , $and:
‚Äò(orientation: landscape)‚Äô) {
  .c-progress-bar__bar {
  margin-bottom:0;
  }
  .c-progress-bar__label {
  display:none;  } }
When designing a web form, 
remember to account for 
accessibility. For example:
The use of the ‚Äòtabindex‚Äô 
attribute to make elements 
focusable ‚Äì and clear visual 
outlines when in focus ‚Äì 
enables the web form to  
be navigated using only  
the keyboard.
Using ‚Äòexample‚Äô instead 
of ‚Äòeg‚Äô in placeholders also 
makes sense when spoken 
by screen reader, sinc this 
makes it much clearer for 
non-native speakers.
For questions which 
involve multiple user inputs 
‚Äì such as date of birth ‚Äì the 
‚Äòaria-labelled-by‚Äô attribute  
on these inputs enables 
screen readers to account 
for this nuance.
For validation errors, the 
use of the ‚Äòaria-described-
by‚Äô attribute on the input 
enables screen readers to 
read out validation errors.
If errors are flagged on 
submit, the first invalid input 
is automatically focused. 
This is useful for users with 
screen readers to get them 
where they need to be.
Including visually hidden 
text in tooltips which adds 
context for users with 
screen readers ‚Äì such as the 
tooltip‚Äôs content ‚Äì and the 
input it belongs to.
See these improvements 
for yourself by browsing the 
form with a screen reader.
