Preface
It is sometimes hard for me to believe that the ﬁrst edition of this book, published in
1988, was only 330 pages and 13 chapters long. The book has grown and been adapted
to keep up with the fast pace of change in derivatives markets.
Like earlier editions, this book serves several markets. It is appropriate for graduate
courses in business, economics, and ﬁnancial engineering. It can be used on advanced
undergraduate courses when students have good quantitative skills. Many practitioners
who are involved in derivatives markets also ﬁnd the book useful. I am delighted that
half the purchasers of the book are analysts, traders, and other professionals who work
in derivatives and risk management.
One of the key decisions that must be made by an author who is writing in the area of
derivatives concerns the use of mathematics. If the level of mathematical sophistication
is too high, the material is likely to be inaccessible to many students and practitioners. If
it is too low, some important issues will inevitably be treated in a rather superﬁcial way.
I have tried to be particularly careful about the way I use both mathematics and
notation in the book. Nonessential mathematical material has been either eliminated
or included in end-of-chapter appendices and the technical notes on my website.
Concepts that are likely to be new to many readers have been explained carefully and
many numerical examples have been included.
Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives can be used for a ﬁrst course in derivatives or
for a more advanced course. There are many diﬀerent ways it can be used in the
classroom. Instructors teaching a ﬁrst course in derivatives are likely to want to spend
most classroom time on the ﬁrst half of the book. Instructors teaching a more advanced
course will ﬁnd that many diﬀerent combinations of chapters in the second half of the
book can be used. I ﬁnd that the material in Chapter 36 works well at the end of either
an introductory or an advanced course.
What’s New in the Ninth Edition?
Material has been updated and improved throughout the book. The changes in the
ninth edition include:
1. New material at various points in the book on the industry’s use of overnight
indexed swap (OIS) rates for discounting.
2. A new chapter early in the book discussing discount rates, credit risk, and funding
costs.
3. New material on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets.
4. More discussion of central clearing, margin requirements, and swap execution
facilities.
19

5. Coverage of products such as DOOM options and CEBOs oﬀered by the CBOE.
6. New nontechnical explanation of the terms in the Black–Scholes–Merton
formulas.
7. Coverage of perpetual options and other perpetual derivatives.
8. Expansion and updating of the material on credit risk and credit derivatives with
the key products and key issues being introduced early in the book.
9. More complete coverage of one-factor equilibrium models of the term structure
10. New release of DerivaGem with many new features (see below).
11. Improvements to the Test Bank, which is available to adopting instructors.
12. Many new end-of-chapter problems.
DerivaGem Software
DerivaGem 3.00 is included with this book. This consists of two Excel applications: the
Options Calculator and the Applications Builder. The Options Calculator consists of
easy-to-use software for valuing a wide range of options. The Applications Builder
consists of a number of Excel functions from which users can build their own applica-
tions. A number of sample applications enabling students to explore the properties of
options and use diﬀerent numerical procedures are included. The Applications Builder
software allows more interesting assignments to be designed. Students have access to the
code for the functions.
DerivaGem 3.00 includes many new features. European options can be valued using
the CEV, Merton mixed-jump diﬀusion, and variance gamma models, which are
discussed in Chapter 27. Monte Carlo experiments can be run. LIBOR and OIS zero
curves can be calculated from market data. Swaps and bonds can be valued. When swaps,
caps, and swaptions are valued, either OIS or LIBOR discounting can be used.
The software is described more fully at the end of the book. The software is available
for download from www.pearsonhighered.com/hull with a Pearson access code, in-
cluded with the book.
Slides
Several hundred PowerPoint slides can be downloaded from Pearson’s Instructor
Resource Center or from my website. Instructors who adopt the text are welcome to
adapt the slides to meet their own needs.
Instructor’s Manual
The Instructor’s Manual is made available online to adopting instructors by Pearson. It
contains solutions to all questions (both Further Questions and Practice Questions),
notes on the teaching of each chapter, Test Bank questions, notes on course organiza-
tion, and some relevant Excel worksheets.
Technical Notes
Technical Notes are used to elaborate on points made in the text. They are referred to in
the text and can be downloaded from:
www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/hull
By not including the Technical Notes in the book, I am able to streamline the
presentation of material so that it is more student-friendly.

Acknowledgments
Many people have played a part in the development of successive editions of this book.
Indeed, the list of people who have provided me with feedback on the book is now so
long that it is not possible to mention everyone. I have beneﬁted from the advice of
many academics who have taught from the book and from the comments of many
derivatives practitioners. I would like to thank the students on my courses at the
University of Toronto who have made many suggestions on how the material can be
improved. Eddie Mizzi from The Geometric Press did an excellent job editing the ﬁnal
manuscript and handling page composition. Emilio Barone from Luiss Guido Carli
University in Rome provided many detailed comments.
Alan White, a colleague at the University of Toronto, deserves a special acknowledg-
ment. Alan and I have been carrying out joint research and consulting in the areas of
derivatives and risk management for about 30 years. During that time, we have spent
many hours discussing key issues. Many of the new ideas in this book, and many of the
new ways used to explain old ideas, are as much Alan’s as mine. Alan has done most of
the development work on the DerivaGem software.
Special thanks are due to many people at Pearson, particularly Donna Battista,
Alison Kalil, and Erin McDonagh, for their enthusiasm, advice, and encouragement. I
welcome comments on the book from readers. My e-mail address is:

Introduction
In the last 40 years, derivatives have become increasingly important in ﬁnance. Futures
and options are actively traded on many exchanges throughout the world. Many
diﬀerent types of forward contracts, swaps, options, and other derivatives are entered
into by ﬁnancial institutions, fund managers, and corporate treasurers in the over-the-
counter market. Derivatives are added to bond issues, used in executive compensation
plans, embedded in capital investment opportunities, used to transfer risks in mortgages
from the original lenders to investors, and so on. We have now reached the stage where
those who work in ﬁnance, and many who work outside ﬁnance, need to understand
how derivatives work, how they are used, and how they are priced.
Whether you love derivatives or hate them, you cannot ignore them! The derivatives
market is huge—much bigger than the stock market when measured in terms of
underlying assets. The value of the assets underlying outstanding derivatives trans-
actions is several times the world gross domestic product. As we shall see in this chapter,
derivatives can be used for hedging or speculation or arbitrage. They play a key role in
transferring a wide range of risks in the economy from one entity to another.
A derivative can be deﬁned as a ﬁnancial instrument whose value depends on (or
derives from) the values of other, more basic, underlying variables. Very often the
variables underlying derivatives are the prices of traded assets. A stock option, for
example, is a derivative whose value is dependent on the price of a stock. However,
derivatives can be dependent on almost any variable, from the price of hogs to the
amount of snow falling at a certain ski resort.
Since the ﬁrst edition of this book was published in 1988 there have been many
developments in derivatives markets. There is now active trading in credit derivatives,
electricity derivatives, weather derivatives, and insurance derivatives. Many new types
of interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity derivative products have been created.
There have been many new ideas in risk management and risk measurement. Capital
investment appraisal now often involves the evaluation of what are known as real
options. Many new regulations have been introduced covering over-the-counter deriva-
tives markets. The book has kept up with all these developments.
Derivatives markets have come under a great deal of criticism because of their role in
the credit crisis that started in 2007. Derivative products were created from portfolios of
risky mortgages in the United States using a procedure known as securitization. Many
of the products that were created became worthless when house prices declined.
23

C H A P T E R

Financial institutions, and investors throughout the world, lost a huge amount of
money and the world was plunged into the worst recession it had experienced in
75 years. Chapter 8 explains how securitization works and why such big losses
occurred. As a result of the credit crisis, derivatives markets are now more heavily
regulated than they used to be. For example, banks are required to keep more capital
for the risks they are taking and to pay more attention to liquidity.
The way banks value derivatives has evolved through time. Collateral arrangements
and credit issues are now given much more attention than in the past. Although it
cannot be justiﬁed theoretically, many banks have changed the proxies they use for the
‘‘risk-free’’ interest rate to reﬂect their funding costs. Chapter 9, new to this edition,
discusses these developments. Credit and collateral issues are considered in greater
detail in Chapter 24.
In this opening chapter, we take a ﬁrst look at derivatives markets and how they are
changing. We describe forward, futures, and options markets and provide an overview
of how they are used by hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Later chapters will give
more details and elaborate on many of the points made here.
1.1
EXCHANGE-TRADED MARKETS
A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that
have been deﬁned by the exchange. Derivatives exchanges have existed for a long time.
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was established in 1848 to bring farmers and
merchants together. Initially its main task was to standardize the quantities and
qualities of the grains that were traded. Within a few years, the ﬁrst futures-type
contract was developed. It was known as a to-arrive contract. Speculators soon became
interested in the contract and found trading the contract to be an attractive alternative
to trading the grain itself. A rival futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME), was established in 1919. Now futures exchanges exist all over the world. (See
table at the end of the book.) The CME and CBOT have merged to form the
CME Group (www.cmegroup.com), which also includes the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the commodity exchange (COMEX), and the Kansas City Board of Trade
(KCBT).
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE, www.cboe.com) started trading call
option contracts on 16 stocks in 1973. Options had traded prior to 1973, but the CBOE
succeeded in creating an orderly market with well-deﬁned contracts. Put option
contracts started trading on the exchange in 1977. The CBOE now trades options on
over 2,500 stocks and many diﬀerent stock indices. Like futures, options have proved to
be very popular contracts. Many other exchanges throughout the world now trade
options. (See table at the end of the book.) The underlying assets include foreign
currencies and futures contracts as well as stocks and stock indices.
Once two traders have agreed on a trade, it is handled by the exchange clearing
house. This stands between the two traders and manages the risks. Suppose, for
example, that trader A agrees to buy 100 ounces of gold from trader B at a future
time for $1,450 per ounce. The result of this trade will be that A has a contract to buy
100 ounces of gold from the clearing house at $1,450 per ounce and B has a contract to
sell 100 ounces of gold to the clearing house for $1,450 per ounce. The advantage of
this arrangement is that traders do not have to worry about the creditworthiness of the
24
CHAPTER 1

people they are trading with. The clearing house takes care of credit risk by requiring
each of the two traders to deposit funds (known as margin) with the clearing house to
ensure that they will live up to their obligations. Margin requirements and the operation
of clearing houses are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
Electronic Markets
Traditionally derivatives exchanges have used what is known as the open outcry system.
This involves traders physically meeting on the ﬂoor of the exchange, shouting, and
using a complicated set of hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry
out. Exchanges have largely replaced the open outcry system by electronic trading. This
involves traders entering their desired trades at a keyboard and a computer being used
to match buyers and sellers. The open outcry system has its advocates, but, as time
passes, it is becoming less and less used.
Electronic trading has led to a growth in high-frequency and algorithmic trading.
This involves the use of computer programs to initiate trades, often without human
intervention, and has become an important feature of derivatives markets.
1.2
OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS
Not all derivatives trading is on exchanges. Many trades take place in the over-the-
counter (OTC) market. Banks, other large ﬁnancial institutions, fund managers, and
corporations are the main participants in OTC derivatives markets. Once an OTC
trade has been agreed, the two parties can either present it to a central counterparty
(CCP) or clear the trade bilaterally. A CCP is like an exchange clearing house. It
stands between the two parties to the derivatives transaction so that one party does not
have to bear the risk that the other party will default. When trades are cleared
bilaterally, the two parties have usually signed an agreement covering all their trans-
actions with each other. The issues covered in the agreement include the circumstances
under which outstanding transactions can be terminated, how settlement amounts are
calculated in the event of a termination, and how the collateral (if any) that must be
posted by each side is calculated. CCPs and bilateral clearing are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 2.
Traditionally, participants in the OTC derivatives markets have contacted each other
directly by phone and email, or have found counterparties for their trades using an
interdealer broker. Banks often act as market makers for the more commonly traded
instruments. This means that they are always prepared to quote a bid price (at which
they are prepared to take one side of a derivatives transaction) and an oﬀer price (at
which they are prepared to take the other side).
Prior to the credit crisis, which started in 2007 and is discussed in some detail in
Chapter 8, OTC derivatives markets were largely unregulated. Following the credit
crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers (see Business Snapshot 1.1), we have seen the
development many new regulations aﬀecting the operation of OTC markets. The
purpose of the regulations is to improve the transparency of OTC markets, improve
market eﬃciency, and reduce systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). The over-the-
counter market in some respects is being forced to become more like the exchange-

traded market. Three important changes are:
1. Standardized OTC derivatives in the United States must, whenever possible, be
traded on what are referred to a swap execution facilities (SEFs). These are
platforms where market participants can post bid and oﬀer quotes and where
market participants can choose to trade by accepting the quotes of other market
participants.
2. There is a requirement in most parts of the world that a CCP be used for most
standardized derivatives transactions.
3. All trades must be reported to a central registry.
Market Size
Both the over-the-counter and the exchange-traded market for derivatives are huge. The
number of derivatives transactions per year in OTC markets is smaller than in exchange-
traded markets, but the average size of the transactions is much greater. Although the
statistics that are collected for the two markets are not exactly comparable, it is clear that
Business Snapshot 1.1
The Lehman Bankruptcy
On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers ﬁled for bankruptcy. This was the largest
bankruptcy in US history and its ramiﬁcations were felt throughout derivatives
markets. Almost until the end, it seemed as though there was a good chance that
Lehman would survive. A number of companies (e.g., the Korean Development
Bank, Barclays Bank in the UK, and Bank of America) expressed interest in buying
it, but none of these was able to close a deal. Many people thought that Lehman was
‘‘too big to fail’’ and that the US government would have to bail it out if no purchaser
could be found. This proved not to be the case.
How did this happen? It was a combination of high leverage, risky investments, and
liquidity problems. Commercial banks that take deposits are subject to regulations on
the amount of capital they must keep. Lehman was an investment bank and not
subject to these regulations. By 2007, its leverage ratio had increased to 31:1, which
means that a 3–4% decline in the value of its assets would wipe out its capital. Dick
Fuld, Lehman’s Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃcer, encouraged an aggressive
deal-making, risk-taking culture. He is reported to have told his executives: ‘‘Every day
is a battle. You have to kill the enemy.’’ The Chief Risk Oﬃcer at Lehman was
competent, but did not have much inﬂuence and was even removed from the executive
committee in 2007. The risks taken by Lehman included large positions in the
instruments created from subprime mortgages, which will be described in Chapter 8.
Lehman funded much of its operations with short-term debt. When there was a loss of
conﬁdence in the company, lenders refused to roll over this funding, forcing it into
bankruptcy.
Lehman was very active in the over-the-counter derivatives markets. It had over a
million transactions outstanding with about 8,000 diﬀerent counterparties. Lehman’s
counterparties were often required to post collateral and this collateral had in many
cases been used by Lehman for various purposes. It is easy to see that sorting out who
owes what to whom in this type of situation is a nightmare!

CHAPTER 1

the over-the-counter market is much larger than the exchange-traded market. The Bank
for International Settlements (www.bis.org) started collecting statistics on the markets
in 1998. Figure 1.1 compares (a) the estimated total principal amounts underlying
transactions that were outstanding in the over-the counter markets between June 1998
and December 2012 and (b) the estimated total value of the assets underlying exchange-
traded contracts during the same period. Using these measures, by December 2012 the
over-the-counter market had grown to $632.6 trillion and the exchange-traded market
had grown to $52.6 trillion.1
In interpreting these numbers, we should bear in mind that the principal underlying
an over-the-counter transaction is not the same as its value. An example of an over-the-
counter transaction is an agreement to buy 100 million US dollars with British pounds

Business Snapshot 1.2 Systemic Risk
Systemic risk is the risk that a default by one ﬁnancial institution will create a ‘‘ripple
eﬀect’’ that leads to defaults by other ﬁnancial institutions and threatens the stability
of the ﬁnancial system. There are huge numbers of over-the-counter transactions
between banks. If Bank A fails, Bank B may take a huge loss on the transactions it
has with Bank A. This in turn could lead to Bank B failing. Bank C that has many
outstanding transactions with both Bank A and Bank B might then take a large loss
and experience severe ﬁnancial diﬃculties; and so on.
The ﬁnancial system has survived defaults such as Drexel in 1990 and Lehman
Brothers in 2008, but regulators continue to be concerned. During the market turmoil
of 2007 and 2008, many large ﬁnancial institutions were bailed out, rather than being
allowed to fail, because governments were concerned about systemic risk.

been created for the purposes of the BIS statistics.

at a predetermined exchange rate in 1 year. The total principal amount underlying this
transaction is $100 million. However, the value of the transaction might be only
$1 million. The Bank for International Settlements estimates the gross market value
of all over-the-counter transactions outstanding in December 2012 to be about
$24.7 trillion.2
1.3
FORWARD CONTRACTS
A relatively simple derivative is a forward contract. It is an agreement to buy or sell an
asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It can be contrasted with a spot
contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset almost immediately. A forward
contract is traded in the over-the-counter market—usually between two ﬁnancial
institutions or between a ﬁnancial institution and one of its clients.
One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and agrees to buy
the underlying asset on a certain speciﬁed future date for a certain speciﬁed price. The
other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for
the same price.
Forward contracts on foreign exchange are very popular. Most large banks employ
both spot and forward foreign-exchange traders. As we shall see in a later chapter, there
is a relationship between forward prices, spot prices, and interest rates in the two
currencies. Table 1.1 provides quotes for the exchange rate between the British pound
(GBP) and the US dollar (USD) that might be made by a large international bank on
May 6, 2013. The quote is for the number of USD per GBP. The ﬁrst row indicates that
the bank is prepared to buy GBP (also known as sterling) in the spot market (i.e., for
virtually immediate delivery) at the rate of $1.5541 per GBP and sell sterling in the spot
market at $1.5545 per GBP. The second, third, and fourth rows indicate that the bank is
prepared to buy sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at $1.5538, $1.5533, and $1.5526 per
GBP, respectively, and to sell sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at $1.5543, $1.5538, and
$1.5532 per GBP, respectively.
Forward contracts can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Suppose that, on
May 6, 2013, the treasurer of a US corporation knows that the corporation will pay
£1 million in 6 months (i.e., on November 6, 2013) and wants to hedge against exchange
rate moves. Using the quotes in Table 1.1, the treasurer can agree to buy £1 million

6 months forward at an exchange rate of 1.5532. The corporation then has a long
forward contract on GBP. It has agreed that on November 6, 2013, it will buy £1 million
from the bank for $1.5532 million. The bank has a short forward contract on GBP. It
has agreed that on November 6, 2013, it will sell £1 million for $1.5532 million. Both
sides have made a binding commitment.
Payoffs from Forward Contracts
Consider the position of the corporation in the trade we have just described. What are
the possible outcomes? The forward contract obligates the corporation to buy £1 million
for $1,553,200. If the spot exchange rate rose to, say, 1.6000, at the end of the 6 months,
the forward contract would be worth $46,800 (¼ $1,600,000  $1,553,200) to the
corporation. It would enable £1 million to be purchased at an exchange rate of
1.5532 rather than 1.6000. Similarly, if the spot exchange rate fell to 1.5000 at the
end of the 6 months, the forward contract would have a negative value to the
corporation of $53,200 because it would lead to the corporation paying $53,200 more
than the market price for the sterling.
In general, the payoﬀfrom a long position in a forward contract on one unit of an
asset is
ST  K
where K is the delivery price and ST is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the
contract. This is because the holder of the contract is obligated to buy an asset worth ST
for K. Similarly, the payoﬀfrom a short position in a forward contract on one unit of
an asset is
K  ST
These payoﬀs can be positive or negative. They are illustrated in Figure 1.2. Because it
costs nothing to enter into a forward contract, the payoﬀfrom the contract is also the
trader’s total gain or loss from the contract.

In the example just considered, K ¼ 1:5532 and the corporation has a long contract.
When ST ¼ 1:6000, the payoﬀis $0.0468 per £1; when ST ¼ 1:5000, it is $0.0532 per £1.
Forward Prices and Spot Prices
We shall be discussing in some detail the relationship between spot and forward prices
in Chapter 5. For a quick preview of why the two are related, consider a stock that pays
no dividend and is worth $60. You can borrow or lend money for 1 year at 5%. What
should the 1-year forward price of the stock be?
The answer is $60 grossed up at 5% for 1 year, or $63. If the forward price is more
than this, say $67, you could borrow $60, buy one share of the stock, and sell it forward
for $67. After paying oﬀthe loan, you would net a proﬁt of $4 in 1 year. If the forward
price is less than $63, say $58, an investor owning the stock as part of a portfolio would
sell the stock for $60 and enter into a forward contract to buy it back for $58 in 1 year.
The proceeds of investment would be invested at 5% to earn $3. The investor would end
up $5 better oﬀthan if the stock were kept in the portfolio for the year.
1.4
FUTURES CONTRACTS
Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or
sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. Unlike forward contracts,
futures contracts are normally traded on an exchange. To make trading possible, the
exchange speciﬁes certain standardized features of the contract. As the two parties to the
contract do not necessarily know each other, the exchange also provides a mechanism
that gives the two parties a guarantee that the contract will be honored.
The largest exchanges on which futures contracts are traded are the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which have now merged
to form the CME Group. On these and other exchanges throughout the world, a very
wide range of commodities and ﬁnancial assets form the underlying assets in the various
contracts. The commodities include pork bellies, live cattle, sugar, wool, lumber,
copper, aluminum, gold, and tin. The ﬁnancial assets include stock indices, currencies,
and Treasury bonds. Futures prices are regularly reported in the ﬁnancial press. Suppose
that, on September 1, the December futures price of gold is quoted as $1,380. This is the
price, exclusive of commissions, at which traders can agree to buy or sell gold for
December delivery. It is determined in the same way as other prices (i.e., by the laws of
supply and demand). If more traders want to go long than to go short, the price goes up;
if the reverse is true, then the price goes down.
Further details on issues such as margin requirements, daily settlement procedures,
delivery procedures, bid–oﬀer spreads, and the role of the exchange clearing house are
given in Chapter 2.
1.5
OPTIONS
Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. There are
two types of option. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset
by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the
30
CHAPTER 1

underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. The price in the contract is known
as the exercise price or strike price; the date in the contract is known as the expiration
date or maturity. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date.
European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself.3 Most of the options
that are traded on exchanges are American. In the exchange-traded equity option
market, one contract is usually an agreement to buy or sell 100 shares. European
options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the
properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European
counterpart.
It should be emphasized that an option gives the holder the right to do something.
The holder does not have to exercise this right. This is what distinguishes options from
forwards and futures, where the holder is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset.
Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a cost to
acquiring an option.
The largest exchange in the world for trading stock options is the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com). Table 1.2 gives the bid and oﬀer quotes for
some of the call options trading on Google (ticker symbol: GOOG) on May 8, 2013.
Table 1.3 does the same for put options trading on Google on that date. The quotes are

Introduction

taken from the CBOE website. The Google stock price at the time of the quotes was bid
871.23, oﬀer 871.37. The bid–oﬀer spread on an option (as a percent of the price) is
usually greater than that on the underlying stock and depends on the volume of trading.
The option strike prices in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are $820, $840, $860, $880, $900, and
$920. The maturities are June 2013, September 2013, and December 2013. The June
options expire on June 22, 2013, the September options on September 21, 2013, and the
December options on December 21, 2013.
The tables illustrate a number of properties of options. The price of a call option
decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the
strike price increases. Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to
maturity increases. These properties of options will be discussed further in Chapter 11.
Suppose an investor instructs a broker to buy one December call option contract on
Google with a strike price of $880. The broker will relay these instructions to a trader at
the CBOE and the deal will be done. The (oﬀer) price indicated in Table 1.2 is $56.30.
This is the price for an option to buy one share. In the United States, an option contract
is a contract to buy or sell 100 shares. Therefore, the investor must arrange for $5,630 to
be remitted to the exchange through the broker. The exchange will then arrange for this
amount to be passed on to the party on the other side of the transaction.
In our example, the investor has obtained at a cost of $5,630 the right to buy 100
Google shares for $880 each. If the price of Google does not rise above $880 by
December 21, 2013, the option is not exercised and the investor loses $5,630.4 But if
Google does well and the option is exercised when the bid price for the stock is $1,000,
the investor is able to buy 100 shares at $880 and immediately sell them for $1,000 for a
proﬁt of $12,000, or $6,370 when the initial cost of the options is taken into account.5
An alternative trade would be to sell one September put option contract with a strike
price of $840 at the bid price of $31.00. This would lead to an immediate cash inﬂow of
100  31:00 ¼ $3,100. If the Google stock price stays above $840, the option is not
exercised and the investor makes a proﬁt of this amount. However, if stock price falls and
the option is exercised when the stock price is $800, then there is a loss. The investor must
buy 100 shares at $840 when they are worth only $800. This leads to a loss of $4,000, or
$900 when the initial amount received for the option contract is taken into account.
The stock options trading on the CBOE are American. If we assume for simplicity
that they are European, so that they can be exercised only at maturity, the investor’s
proﬁt as a function of the ﬁnal stock price for the two trades we have considered is
shown in Figure 1.3.
Further details about the operation of options markets and how prices such as those
in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are determined by traders are given in later chapters. At this stage
we note that there are four types of participants in options markets:
1. Buyers of calls
2. Sellers of calls
3. Buyers of puts
4. Sellers of puts.
4 The calculations here ignore commissions paid by the investor.
5 The calculations here ignore the eﬀect of discounting. Theoretically, the $12,000 should be discounted from
the time of exercise to the purchase date, when calculating the proﬁt.
32
CHAPTER 1

Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short
positions. Selling an option is also known as writing the option.
1.6
TYPES OF TRADERS
Derivatives markets have been outstandingly successful. The main reason is that they
have attracted many diﬀerent types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity. When
an investor wants to take one side of a contract, there is usually no problem in ﬁnding
someone who is prepared to take the other side.
Three broad categories of traders can be identiﬁed: hedgers, speculators, and
arbitrageurs. Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential
future movements in a market variable. Speculators use them to bet on the future
direction of a market variable. Arbitrageurs take oﬀsetting positions in two or more
instruments to lock in a proﬁt. As described in Business Snapshot 1.3, hedge funds have
become big users of derivatives for all three purposes.
In the next few sections, we will consider the activities of each type of trader in more
detail.
1.7
HEDGERS
In this section we illustrate how hedgers can reduce their risks with forward contracts
and options.
Hedging Using Forward Contracts
Suppose that it is May 6, 2013, and ImportCo, a company based in the United States,
knows that it will have to pay £10 million on August 6, 2013, for goods it has purchased
from a British supplier. The USD–GBP exchange rate quotes made by a ﬁnancial
institution are shown in Table 1.1. ImportCo could hedge its foreign exchange risk by
buying pounds (GBP) from the ﬁnancial institution in the 3-month forward market

at 1.5538. This would have the eﬀect of ﬁxing the price to be paid to the British
exporter at $15,538,000.
Consider next another US company, which we will refer to as ExportCo, that is
exporting goods to the United Kingdom and, on May 6, 2013, knows that it will receive
£30 million 3 months later. ExportCo can hedge its foreign exchange risk by selling
£30 million in the 3-month forward market at an exchange rate of 1.5533. This would
have the eﬀect of locking in the US dollars to be realized for the sterling at $46,599,000.
Note that a company might do better if it chooses not to hedge than if it chooses to
hedge. Alternatively, it might do worse. Consider ImportCo. If the exchange rate

Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have become major users of derivatives for hedging, speculation, and
arbitrage. They are similar to mutual funds in that they invest funds on behalf of
clients. However, they accept funds only from ﬁnancially sophisticated individuals and
do not publicly oﬀer their securities. Mutual funds are subject to regulations requiring
that the shares be redeemable at any time, that investment policies be disclosed, that
the use of leverage be limited, and so on. Hedge funds are relatively free of these
regulations. This gives them a great deal of freedom to develop sophisticated,
unconventional, and proprietary investment strategies. The fees charged by hedge
fund managers are dependent on the fund’s performance and are relatively high—
typically 1 to 2% of the amount invested plus 20% of the proﬁts. Hedge funds have
grown in popularity, with about $2 trillion being invested in them throughout the
world. ‘‘Funds of funds’’ have been set up to invest in a portfolio of hedge funds.
The investment strategy followed by a hedge fund manager often involves using
derivatives to set up a speculative or arbitrage position. Once the strategy has been
deﬁned, the hedge fund manager must:
1. Evaluate the risks to which the fund is exposed
2. Decide which risks are acceptable and which will be hedged
3. Devise strategies (usually involving derivatives) to hedge the unacceptable risks.
Here are some examples of the labels used for hedge funds together with the trading
strategies followed:
Long/Short Equities: Purchase securities considered to be undervalued and short those
considered to be overvalued in such a way that the exposure to the overall direction of
the market is small.
Convertible Arbitrage: Take a long position in a thought-to-be-undervalued conver-
tible bond combined with an actively managed short position in the underlying
equity.
Distressed Securities: Buy securities issued by companies in, or close to, bankruptcy.
Emerging Markets: Invest in debt and equity of companies in developing or emerging
countries and in the debt of the countries themselves.
Global Macro: Carry out trades that reﬂect anticipated global macroeconomic trends.
Merger Arbitrage: Trade after a possible merger or acquisition is announced so that a
proﬁt is made if the announced deal takes place.

CHAPTER 1

is 1.4000 on August 24 and the company has not hedged, the £10 million that it has to
pay will cost $14,000,000, which is less than $15,538,000. On the other hand, if the
exchange rate is 1.6000, the £10 million will cost $16,000,000—and the company will
wish that it had hedged! The position of ExportCo if it does not hedge is the reverse. If
the exchange rate in August proves to be less than 1.5533, the company will wish that it
had hedged; if the rate is greater than 1.5533, it will be pleased that it has not done so.
This example illustrates a key aspect of hedging. The purpose of hedging is to reduce
risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the
outcome without hedging.
Hedging Using Options
Options can also be used for hedging. Consider an investor who in May of a particular
year owns 1,000 shares of a particular company. The share price is $28 per share. The
investor is concerned about a possible share price decline in the next 2 months and
wants protection. The investor could buy ten July put option contracts on the
company’s stock with a strike price of $27.50. This would give the investor the right
to sell a total of 1,000 shares for a price of $27.50. If the quoted option price is $1, then
each option contract would cost 100  $1 ¼ $100 and the total cost of the hedging
strategy would be 10  $100 ¼ $1,000.
The strategy costs $1,000 but guarantees that the shares can be sold for at least $27.50
per share during the life of the option. If the market price of the stock falls below $27.50,
the options will be exercised, so that $27,500 is realized for the entire holding. When the
cost of the options is taken into account, the amount realized is $26,500. If the market
price stays above $27.50, the options are not exercised and expire worthless. However, in
this case the value of the holding is always above $27,500 (or above $26,500 when the cost
of the options is taken into account). Figure 1.4 shows the net value of the portfolio (after
taking the cost of the options into account) as a function of the stock price in 2 months.
The dotted line shows the value of the portfolio assuming no hedging.

A Comparison
There is a fundamental diﬀerence between the use of forward contracts and options
for hedging. Forward contracts are designed to neutralize risk by ﬁxing the price that
the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset. Option contracts, by contrast,
provide insurance. They oﬀer a way for investors to protect themselves against adverse
price movements in the future while still allowing them to beneﬁt from favorable price
movements. Unlike forwards, options involve the payment of an up-front fee.
1.8
SPECULATORS
We now move on to consider how futures and options markets can be used by
speculators. Whereas hedgers want to avoid exposure to adverse movements in the price
of an asset, speculators wish to take a position in the market. Either they are betting that
the price of the asset will go up or they are betting that it will go down.
Speculation Using Futures
Consider a US speculator who in February thinks that the British pound will strengthen
relative to the US dollar over the next 2 months and is prepared to back that hunch to
the tune of £250,000. One thing the speculator can do is purchase £250,000 in the spot
market in the hope that the sterling can be sold later at a higher price. (The sterling once
purchased would be kept in an interest-bearing account.) Another possibility is to take
a long position in four CME April futures contracts on sterling. (Each futures contract
is for the purchase of £62,500.) Table 1.4 summarizes the two alternatives on the
assumption that the current exchange rate is 1.5470 dollars per pound and the April
futures price is 1.5410 dollars per pound. If the exchange rate turns out to be 1.6000
dollars per pound in April, the futures contract alternative enables the speculator to
realize a proﬁt of ð1:6000  1:5410Þ  250,000 ¼ $14,750. The spot market alternative
leads to 250,000 units of an asset being purchased for $1.5470 in February and sold for
$1.6000 in April, so that a proﬁt of ð1:6000  1:5470Þ  250,000 ¼ $13,250 is made. If
the exchange rate falls to 1.5000 dollars per pound, the futures contract gives rise to a
ð1:5410  1:5000Þ  250,000 ¼ $10,250 loss, whereas the spot market alternative gives
rise to a loss of ð1:5470  1:5000Þ  250,000 ¼ $11,750. The spot market alternative

CHAPTER 1

appears to give rise to slightly worse outcomes for both scenarios. But this is because
the calculations do not reﬂect the interest that is earned or paid.
What then is the diﬀerence between the two alternatives? The ﬁrst alternative of
buying sterling requires an up-front investment of $386,750 ð¼ 250,000  1:5470Þ.
In contrast, the second alternative requires only a small amount of cash to be
deposited by the speculator in what is termed a ‘‘margin account’’. (The operation
of margin accounts is explained in Chapter 2.) In Table 1.4, the initial margin
requirement is assumed to be $5,000 per contract, or $20,000 in total. The futures
market allows the speculator to obtain leverage. With a relatively small initial outlay,
the investor is able to take a large speculative position.
Speculation Using Options
Options can also be used for speculation. Suppose that it is October and a speculator
considers that a stock is likely to increase in value over the next 2 months. The stock
price is currently $20, and a 2-month call option with a $22.50 strike price is currently
selling for $1. Table 1.5 illustrates two possible alternatives, assuming that the spec-
ulator is willing to invest $2,000. One alternative is to purchase 100 shares; the other
involves the purchase of 2,000 call options (i.e., 20 call option contracts). Suppose that
the speculator’s hunch is correct and the price of the stock rises to $27 by December.
The ﬁrst alternative of buying the stock yields a proﬁt of
100  ð$27  $20Þ ¼ $700
However, the second alternative is far more proﬁtable. A call option on the stock with a
strike price of $22.50 gives a payoﬀof $4.50, because it enables something worth $27 to
be bought for $22.50. The total payoﬀfrom the 2,000 options that are purchased under
the second alternative is
2,000  $4:50 ¼ $9,000
Subtracting the original cost of the options yields a net proﬁt of
$9,000  $2,000 ¼ $7,000
The options strategy is, therefore, 10 times more proﬁtable than directly buying the stock.
Options also give rise to a greater potential loss. Suppose the stock price falls to $15
by December. The ﬁrst alternative of buying stock yields a loss of
100  ð$20  $15Þ ¼ $500
Table 1.5

Introduction
37

Because the call options expire without being exercised, the options strategy would lead
to a loss of $2,000—the original amount paid for the options. Figure 1.5 shows the proﬁt
or loss from the two strategies as a function of the stock price in 2 months.
Options like futures provide a form of leverage. For a given investment, the use of
options magniﬁes the ﬁnancial consequences. Good outcomes become very good, while
bad outcomes result in the whole initial investment being lost.
A Comparison
Futures and options are similar instruments for speculators in that they both provide a
way in which a type of leverage can be obtained. However, there is an important
diﬀerence between the two. When a speculator uses futures, the potential loss as well as
the potential gain is very large. When options are used, no matter how bad things get,
the speculator’s loss is limited to the amount paid for the options.
1.9
ARBITRAGEURS
Arbitrageurs are a third important group of participants in futures, forward, and
options markets. Arbitrage involves locking in a riskless proﬁt by simultaneously
entering into transactions in two or more markets. In later chapters we will see how
arbitrage is sometimes possible when the futures price of an asset gets out of line with
its spot price. We will also examine how arbitrage can be used in options markets. This
section illustrates the concept of arbitrage with a very simple example.
Let us consider a stock that is traded on both the New York Stock Exchange
(www.nyse.com) and the London Stock Exchange (www.stockex.co.uk). Suppose
that the stock price is $150 in New York and £100 in London at a time when the

CHAPTER 1

exchange rate is $1.5300 per pound. An arbitrageur could simultaneously buy
100 shares of the stock in New York and sell them in London to obtain a risk-free
proﬁt of
100  ½ð$1:53  100Þ  $150
or $300 in the absence of transactions costs. Transactions costs would probably
eliminate the proﬁt for a small investor. However, a large investment bank faces very
low transactions costs in both the stock market and the foreign exchange market. It
would ﬁnd the arbitrage opportunity very attractive and would try to take as much
advantage of it as possible.
Arbitrage opportunities such as the one just described cannot last for long. As
arbitrageurs buy the stock in New York, the forces of supply and demand will cause
the dollar price to rise. Similarly, as they sell the stock in London, the sterling price will
be driven down. Very quickly the two prices will become equivalent at the current
exchange rate. Indeed, the existence of proﬁt-hungry arbitrageurs makes it unlikely that
a major disparity between the sterling price and the dollar price could ever exist in the
ﬁrst place. Generalizing from this example, we can say that the very existence of
arbitrageurs means that in practice only very small arbitrage opportunities are observed
in the prices that are quoted in most ﬁnancial markets. In this book most of the
arguments concerning futures prices, forward prices, and the values of option contracts
will be based on the assumption that no arbitrage opportunities exist.
1.10
DANGERS
Derivatives are very versatile instruments. As we have seen, they can be used for
hedging, for speculation, and for arbitrage. It is this very versatility that can cause
problems. Sometimes traders who have a mandate to hedge risks or follow an
arbitrage strategy become (consciously or unconsciously) speculators. The results
can be disastrous. One example of this is provided by the activities of Je´ roˆ me Kerviel
at Socie´ te´ Ge´ ne´ ral (see Business Snapshot 1.4).
To avoid the sort of problems Socie´ te´ Ge´ ne´ ral encountered, it is very important for
both ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial corporations to set up controls to ensure that deriva-
tives are being used for their intended purpose. Risk limits should be set and the
activities of traders should be monitored daily to ensure that these risk limits are
adhered to.
Unfortunately, even when traders follow the risk limits that have been speciﬁed, big
mistakes can happen. Some of the activities of traders in the derivatives market during
the period leading up to the start of the credit crisis in July 2007 proved to be much
riskier than they were thought to be by the ﬁnancial institutions they worked for. As
will be discussed in Chapter 8, house prices in the United States had been rising fast.
Most people thought that the increases would continue—or, at worst, that house prices
would simply level oﬀ. Very few were prepared for the steep decline that actually
happened. Furthermore, very few were prepared for the high correlation between
mortgage default rates in diﬀerent parts of the country. Some risk managers did express
reservations about the exposures of the companies for which they worked to the US real
estate market. But, when times are good (or appear to be good), there is an unfortunate
tendency to ignore risk managers and this is what happened at many ﬁnancial
Introduction
39

institutions during the 2006–2007 period. The key lesson from the credit crisis is that
ﬁnancial institutions should always be dispassionately asking ‘‘What can go wrong?’’,
and they should follow that up with the question ‘‘If it does go wrong, how much will
we lose?’’
SUMMARY
One of the exciting developments in ﬁnance over the last 40 years has been the growth
of derivatives markets. In many situations, both hedgers and speculators ﬁnd it more
attractive to trade a derivative on an asset than to trade the asset itself. Some derivatives
are traded on exchanges; others are traded by ﬁnancial institutions, fund managers, and
corporations in the over-the-counter market, or added to new issues of debt and equity
securities. Much of this book is concerned with the valuation of derivatives. The aim is
Business Snapshot 1.4 SocGen’s Big Loss in 2008
Derivatives are very versatile instruments. They can be used for hedging, speculation,
and arbitrage. One of the risks faced by a company that trades derivatives is that an
employee who has a mandate to hedge or to look for arbitrage opportunities may
become a speculator.
Je´ roˆ me Kerviel joined Socie´ te´ Ge´ ne´ ral (SocGen) in 2000 to work in the compliance
area. In 2005, he was promoted and became a junior trader in the bank’s Delta One
products team. He traded equity indices such as the German DAX index, the French
CAC 40, and the Euro Stoxx 50. His job was to look for arbitrage opportunities.
These might arise if a futures contract on an equity index was trading for a diﬀerent
price on two diﬀerent exchanges. They might also arise if equity index futures prices
were not consistent with the prices of the shares constituting the index. (This type of
arbitrage is discussed in Chapter 5.)
Kerviel used his knowledge of the bank’s procedures to speculate while giving the
appearance of arbitraging. He took big positions in equity indices and created
ﬁctitious trades to make it appear that he was hedged. In reality, he had large bets
on the direction in which the indices would move. The size of his unhedged position
grew over time to tens of billions of euros.
In January 2008, his unauthorized trading was uncovered by SocGen. Over a three-
day period, the bank unwound his position for a loss of 4.9 billion euros. This was at
the time the biggest loss created by fraudulent activity in the history of ﬁnance. (Later
in the year, a much bigger loss from Bernard Madoﬀ’s Ponzi scheme came to light.)
Rogue trader losses were not unknown at banks prior to 2008. For example, in the
1990s, Nick Leeson, who worked at Barings Bank, had a mandate similar to that of
Je´ roˆ me Kerviel. His job was to arbitrage between Nikkei 225 futures quotes in
Singapore and Osaka. Instead he found a way to make big bets on the direction of
the Nikkei 225 using futures and options, losing $1 billion and destroying the 200-year
old bank in the process. In 2002, it was found that John Rusnak at Allied Irish Bank
had lost $700 million from unauthorized foreign exchange trading. The lessons from
these losses are that it is important to deﬁne unambiguous risk limits for traders and
then to monitor what they do very carefully to make sure that the limits are adhered to.

CHAPTER 1

to present a unifying framework within which all derivatives—not just options or
futures—can be valued.
In this chapter we have taken a ﬁrst look at forward, futures, and options contracts.
A forward or futures contract involves an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a certain
time in the future for a certain price. There are two types of options: calls and puts.
A call option gives the holder the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain
price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a
certain price. Forwards, futures, and options trade on a wide range of diﬀerent under-
lying assets.
Derivatives have been very successful innovations in capital markets. Three main
types of traders can be identiﬁed: hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Hedgers are in
the position where they face risk associated with the price of an asset. They use
derivatives to reduce or eliminate this risk. Speculators wish to bet on future movements
in the price of an asset. They use derivatives to get extra leverage. Arbitrageurs are in
business to take advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two diﬀerent markets. If,
for example, they see the futures price of an asset getting out of line with the cash price,
they will take oﬀsetting positions in the two markets to lock in a proﬁt.

1.23. In the 1980s, Bankers Trust developed index currency option notes (ICONs). These are
bonds in which the amount received by the holder at maturity varies with a foreign
exchange rate. One example was its trade with the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. The
ICON speciﬁed that if the yen–US dollar exchange rate, ST, is greater than 169 yen per
dollar at maturity (in 1995), the holder of the bond receives $1,000. If it is less than
169 yen per dollar, the amount received by the holder of the bond is

Mechanics of
Futures Markets
In Chapter 1 we explained that both futures and forward contracts are agreements to
buy or sell an asset at a future time for a certain price. A futures contract is traded on an
exchange, and the contract terms are standardized by that exchange. A forward
contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and can be customized if necessary.
This chapter covers the details of how futures markets work. We examine issues such as
the speciﬁcation of contracts, the operation of margin accounts, the organization of
exchanges, the regulation of markets, theway in which quotes are made, and the treatment
of futures transactions for accounting and tax purposes. We explain how some of the ideas
pioneered by futures exchanges are now being adopted by over-the-counter markets.
2.1
BACKGROUND
As we saw in Chapter 1, futures contracts are now traded actively all over the world. The
Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the New York
Mercantile Exchange have merged to form the CME Group (www.cmegroup.com).
Other large exchanges include the InterContinental Exchange (www.theice.com) which
is acquiring NYSE Euronext (www.euronext.com), Eurex (www.eurexchange.com),
BM&F BOVESPA (www.bmfbovespa.com.br), and the Tokyo Financial Exchange
(www.tfx.co.jp). A table at the end of this book provides a more complete list of
exchanges.
We examine how a futures contract comes into existence by considering the corn
futures contract traded by the CME Group. On June 5 a trader in New York might call
a broker with instructions to buy 5,000 bushels of corn for delivery in September of the
same year. The broker would immediately issue instructions to a trader to buy (i.e., take
a long position in) one September corn contract. (Each corn contract is for the delivery
of exactly 5,000 bushels.) At about the same time, another trader in Kansas might
instruct a broker to sell 5,000 bushels of corn for September delivery. This broker
would then issue instructions to sell (i.e., take a short position in) one corn contract. A
price would be determined and the deal would be done. Under the traditional open
outcry system, ﬂoor traders representing each party would physically meet to determine
the price. With electronic trading, a computer would match the traders.

C H A P T E R

The trader in New York who agreed to buy has a long futures position in one
contract; the trader in Kansas who agreed to sell has a short futures position in one
contract. The price agreed to is the current futures price for September corn, say
600 cents per bushel. This price, like any other price, is determined by the laws of
supply and demand. If, at a particular time, more traders wish to sell rather than buy
September corn, the price will go down. New buyers then enter the market so that a
balance between buyers and sellers is maintained. If more traders wish to buy rather
than sell September corn, the price goes up. New sellers then enter the market and a
balance between buyers and sellers is maintained.
Closing Out Positions
The vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery. The reason is that most
traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period speciﬁed in the
Business Snapshot 2.1
The Unanticipated Delivery of a Futures Contract
This story (which may well be apocryphal) was told to the author of this book a long
time ago by a senior executive of a ﬁnancial institution. It concerns a new employee
of the ﬁnancial institution who had not previously worked in the ﬁnancial sector.
One of the clients of the ﬁnancial institution regularly entered into a long futures
contract on live cattle for hedging purposes and issued instructions to close out the
position on the last day of trading. (Live cattle futures contracts are traded by the
CME Group and each contract is on 40,000 pounds of cattle.) The new employee was
given responsibility for handling the account.
When the time came to close out a contract the employee noted that the client was
long one contract and instructed a trader at the exchange to buy (not sell) one
contract. The result of this mistake was that the ﬁnancial institution ended up with a
long position in two live cattle futures contracts. By the time the mistake was spotted
trading in the contract had ceased.
The ﬁnancial institution (not the client) was responsible for the mistake. As a
result, it started to look into the details of the delivery arrangements for live cattle
futures contracts—something it had never done before. Under the terms of the
contract, cattle could be delivered by the party with the short position to a number
of diﬀerent locations in the United States during the delivery month. Because it was
long, the ﬁnancial institution could do nothing but wait for a party with a short
position to issue a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange and for the exchange
to assign that notice to the ﬁnancial institution.
It eventually received a notice from the exchange and found that it would receive
live cattle at a location 2,000 miles away the following Tuesday. The new employee
was sent to the location to handle things. It turned out that the location had a cattle
auction every Tuesday. The party with the short position that was making delivery
bought cattle at the auction and then immediately delivered them. Unfortunately the
cattle could not be resold until the next cattle auction the following Tuesday. The
employee was therefore faced with the problem of making arrangements for the cattle
to be housed and fed for a week. This was a great start to a ﬁrst job in the ﬁnancial
sector!

contract. Closing out a position means entering into the opposite trade to the original
one. For example, the New York trader who bought a September corn futures contract
on June 5 can close out the position by selling (i.e., shorting) one September corn futures
contract on, say, July 20. The Kansas trader who sold (i.e., shorted) a September contract
on June 5 can close out the position by buying one September contract on, say,
August 25. In each case, the trader’s total gain or loss is determined by the change in
the futures price between June 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.
Delivery is so unusual that traders sometimes forget how the delivery process works
(see Business Snapshot 2.1). Nevertheless, we will review delivery procedures later in
this chapter. This is because it is the possibility of ﬁnal delivery that ties the futures
price to the spot price.1
2.2
SPECIFICATION OF A FUTURES CONTRACT
When developing a new contract, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact
nature of the agreement between the two parties. In particular, it must specify the asset,
the contract size (exactly how much of the asset will be delivered under one contract),
where delivery can be made, and when delivery can be made.
Sometimes alternatives are speciﬁed for the grade of the asset that will be delivered or
for the delivery locations. As a general rule, it is the party with the short position (the
party that has agreed to sell the asset) that chooses what will happen when alternatives
are speciﬁed by the exchange.2 When the party with the short position is ready to
deliver, it ﬁles a notice of intention to deliver with the exchange. This notice indicates
any selections it has made with respect to the grade of asset that will be delivered and
the delivery location.
The Asset
When the asset is a commodity, there may be quite a variation in the quality of what is
available in the marketplace. When the asset is speciﬁed, it is therefore important that the
exchange stipulate the grade or grades of the commodity that are acceptable. The
IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) has speciﬁed the asset in its orange juice futures
contract as frozen concentrates that are US Grade A with Brix value of not less than
62.5 degrees.
For some commodities a range of grades can be delivered, but the price received
depends on the grade chosen. For example, in the CME Group’s corn futures contract,
the standard grade is ‘‘No. 2 Yellow,’’ but substitutions are allowed with the price being
adjusted in a way established by the exchange. No. 1 Yellow is deliverable for 1.5 cents
per bushel more than No. 2 Yellow. No. 3 Yellow is deliverable for 1.5 cents per bushel
less than No. 2 Yellow.
The ﬁnancial assets in futures contracts are generally well deﬁned and unambiguous.
For example, there is no need to specify the grade of a Japanese yen. However, there are
1 As mentioned in Chapter 1, the spot price is the price for almost immediate delivery.
2 There are exceptions. As pointed out by J. E. Newsome, G. H. F. Wang, M. E. Boyd, and M. J. Fuller in
‘‘Contract Modiﬁcations and the Basic Behavior of Live Cattle Futures,’’ Journal of Futures Markets, 24, 6
(2004), 557–90, the CME gave the buyer some delivery options in live cattle futures in 1995.

CHAPTER 2

some interesting features of the Treasury bond and Treasury note futures contracts
traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. The underlying asset in the Treasury bond
contract is any US Treasury bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years. In the
Treasury note futures contract, the underlying asset is any Treasury note with a
maturity of between 6.5 and 10 years. In both cases, the exchange has a formula for
adjusting the price received according to the coupon and maturity date of the bond
delivered. This is discussed in Chapter 6.
The Contract Size
The contract size speciﬁes the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one
contract. This is an important decision for the exchange. If the contract size is too large,
many investors who wish to hedge relatively small exposures or who wish to take
relatively small speculative positions will be unable to use the exchange. On the other
hand, if the contract size is too small, trading may be expensive as there is a cost
associated with each contract traded.
The correct size for a contract clearly depends on the likely user. Whereas the value of
what is delivered under a futures contract on an agricultural product might be $10,000
to $20,000, it is much higher for some ﬁnancial futures. For example, under the
Treasury bond futures contract traded by the CME Group, instruments with a face
value of $100,000 are delivered.
In some cases exchanges have introduced ‘‘mini’’ contracts to attract smaller inves-
tors. For example, the CME Group’s Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the
Nasdaq 100 index, whereas the regular contract is on 100 times the index. (We will cover
futures on indices more fully in Chapter 3.)
Delivery Arrangements
The place where delivery will be made must be speciﬁed by the exchange. This is
particularly important for commodities that involve signiﬁcant transportation costs. In
the case of the ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contract, delivery is to exchange-
licensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware.
When alternative delivery locations are speciﬁed, the price received by the party with
the short position is sometimes adjusted according to the location chosen by that party.
The price tends to be higher for delivery locations that are relatively far from the main
sources of the commodity.
Delivery Months
A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. The exchange must specify the
precise period during the month when delivery can be made. For many futures
contracts, the delivery period is the whole month.
The delivery months vary from contract to contract and are chosen by the exchange
to meet the needs of market participants. For example, corn futures traded by the CME
Group have delivery months of March, May, July, September, and December. At any
given time, contracts trade for the closest delivery month and a number of subsequent
delivery months. The exchange speciﬁes when trading in a particular month’s contract
will begin. The exchange also speciﬁes the last day on which trading can take place for a
Mechanics of Futures Markets
49

given contract. Trading generally ceases a few days before the last day on which delivery
can be made.
Price Quotes
The exchange deﬁnes how prices will be quoted. For example, in the US crude oil
futures contract, prices are quoted in dollars and cents. Treasury bond and Treasury
note futures prices are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar.
Price Limits and Position Limits
For most contracts, daily price movement limits are speciﬁed by the exchange. If in a
day the price moves down from the previous day’s close by an amount equal to the
daily price limit, the contract is said to be limit down. If it moves up by the limit, it is
said to be limit up. A limit move is a move in either direction equal to the daily price
limit. Normally, trading ceases for the day once the contract is limit up or limit down.
However, in some instances the exchange has the authority to step in and change the
limits.
The purpose of daily price limits is to prevent large price movements from occurring
because of speculative excesses. However, limits can become an artiﬁcial barrier to
trading when the price of the underlying commodity is advancing or declining rapidly.
Whether price limits are, on balance, good for futures markets is controversial.
Position limits are the maximum number of contracts that a speculator may hold.
The purpose of these limits is to prevent speculators from exercising undue inﬂuence on
the market.
2.3
CONVERGENCE OF FUTURES PRICE TO SPOT PRICE
As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges
to the spot price of the underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the
futures price equals—or is very close to—the spot price.
To see why this is so, we ﬁrst suppose that the futures price is above the spot price
during the delivery period. Traders then have a clear arbitrage opportunity:
1. Sell (i.e., short) a futures contract
2. Buy the asset
3. Make delivery.
These steps are certain to lead to a proﬁt equal to the amount by which the futures price
exceeds the spot price. As traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity, the futures price
will fall. Suppose next that the futures price is below the spot price during the delivery
period. Companies interested in acquiring the asset will ﬁnd it attractive to enter into a
long futures contract and then wait for delivery to be made. As they do so, the futures
price will tend to rise.
The result is that the futures price is very close to the spot price during the delivery
period. Figure 2.1 illustrates the convergence of the futures price to the spot price. In
Figure 2.1a the futures price is above the spot price prior to the delivery period. In
50
CHAPTER 2

Figure 2.1b the futures price is below the spot price prior to the delivery period. The
circumstances under which these two patterns are observed are discussed in Chapter 5.
2.4
THE OPERATION OF MARGIN ACCOUNTS
If two investors get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the
future for a certain price, there are obvious risks. One of the investors may regret the
deal and try to back out. Alternatively, the investor simply may not have the ﬁnancial
resources to honor the agreement. One of the key roles of the exchange is to organize
trading so that contract defaults are avoided. This is where margin accounts come in.
Daily Settlement
To illustrate how margin accounts work, we consider an investor who contacts his or
her broker to buy two December gold futures contracts on the COMEX division of the
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), which is part of the CME Group. We
suppose that the current futures price is $1,450 per ounce. Because the contract size is
100 ounces, the investor has contracted to buy a total of 200 ounces at this price. The
broker will require the investor to deposit funds in a margin account. The amount that
must be deposited at the time the contract is entered into is known as the initial margin.
We suppose this is $6,000 per contract, or $12,000 in total. At the end of each trading
day, the margin account is adjusted to reﬂect the investor’s gain or loss. This practice is
referred to as daily settlement or marking to market.
Suppose, for example, that by the end of the ﬁrst day the futures price has dropped by
$9 from $1,450 to $1,441. The investor has a loss of $1,800 (¼ 200  $9), because the
200 ounces of December gold, which the investor contracted to buy at $1,450, can now be
sold for only $1,441. The balance in the margin account would therefore be reduced by
$1,800 to $10,200. Similarly, if the price of December gold rose to $1,459 by the end of

the ﬁrst day, the balance in the margin account would be increased by $1,800 to $13,800.
A trade is ﬁrst settled at the close of the day on which it takes place. It is then settled at the
close of trading on each subsequent day.
Note that daily settlement is not merely an arrangement between broker and client.
When there is a decrease in the futures price so that the margin account of an investor
with a long position is reduced by $1,800, the investor’s broker has to pay the exchange
clearing house $1,800 and this money is passed on to the broker of an investor with a
short position. Similarly, when there is an increase in the futures price, brokers for
parties with short positions pay money to the exchange clearing house and brokers for
parties with long positions receive money from the exchange clearing house. Later we
will examine in more detail the mechanism by which this happens.
The investor is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account in excess of
the initial margin. To ensure that the balance in the margin account never becomes
negative a maintenance margin, which is somewhat lower than the initial margin, is set.
If the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the investor
receives a margin call and is expected to top up the margin account to the initial margin
level by the end of the next day. The extra funds deposited are known as a variation
margin. If the investor does not provide the variation margin, the broker closes out the
position. In the case of the investor considered earlier, closing out the position would
involve neutralizing the existing contract by selling 200 ounces of gold for delivery in
December.

contracts. The initial margin is $6,000 per contract, or $12,000 in total; the
maintenance margin is $4,500 per contract, or $9,000 in total. The contract is entered
into on Day 1 at $1,450 and closed out on Day 16 at $1,426.90.

CHAPTER 2

Table 2.1 illustrates the operation of the margin account for one possible sequence of
futures prices in the case of the investor considered earlier. The maintenance margin is
assumed to be $4,500 per contract, or $9,000 in total. On Day 7, the balance in the
margin account falls $1,020 below the maintenance margin level. This drop triggers a
margin call from the broker for an additional $4,020 to bring the account balance up to
the initial margin level of $12,000. It is assumed that the investor provides this margin by
the close of trading on Day 8. On Day 11, the balance in the margin account again falls
below the maintenance margin level, and a margin call for $3,780 is sent out. The investor
provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 12. On Day 16, the investor decides to
close out the position by selling two contracts. The futures price on that day is $1,226.90,
and the investor has a cumulative loss of $4,620. Note that the investor has excess margin
on Days 8, 13, 14, and 15. It is assumed that the excess is not withdrawn.
Further Details
Most brokers pay investors interest on the balance in a margin account. The balance in
the account does not, therefore, represent a true cost, provided that the interest rate is
competitive with what could be earned elsewhere. To satisfy the initial margin require-
ments, but not subsequent margin calls, an investor can usually deposit securities with
the broker. Treasury bills are usually accepted in lieu of cash at about 90% of their face
value. Shares are also sometimes accepted in lieu of cash, but at about 50% of their
market value.
Whereas a forward contract is settled at the end of its life, a futures contract is, as we
have seen, settled daily. At the end of each day, the investor’s gain (loss) is added to
(subtracted from) the margin account, bringing the value of the contract back to zero.
A futures contract is in eﬀect closed out and rewritten at a new price each day.
Minimum levels for the initial and maintenance margin are set by the exchange
clearing house. Individual brokers may require greater margins from their clients than
the minimum levels speciﬁed by the exchange clearing house. Minimum margin levels
are determined by the variability of the price of the underlying asset and are revised
when necessary. The higher the variability, the higher the margin levels. The mainten-
ance margin is usually about 75% of the initial margin.
Margin requirements may depend on the objectives of the trader. A bona ﬁde hedger,
such as a company that produces the commodity on which the futures contract is
written, is often subject to lower margin requirements than a speculator. The reason is
that there is deemed to be less risk of default. Day trades and spread transactions often
give rise to lower margin requirements than do hedge transactions. In a day trade the
trader announces to the broker an intent to close out the position in the same day. In a
spread transaction the trader simultaneously buys (i.e., takes a long position in) a
contract on an asset for one maturity month and sells (i.e., takes a short position in)
a contract on the same asset for another maturity month.
Note that margin requirements are the same on short futures positions as they are on
long futures positions. It is just as easy to take a short futures position as it is to take a
long one. The spot market does not have this symmetry. Taking a long position in the
spot market involves buying the asset for immediate delivery and presents no problems.
Taking a short position involves selling an asset that you do not own. This is a more
complex transaction that may or may not be possible in a particular market. It is
discussed further in Chapter 5.
Mechanics of Futures Markets
53

The Clearing House and Its Members
A clearing house acts as an intermediary in futures transactions. It guarantees the
performance of the parties to each transaction. The clearing house has a number of
members. Brokers who are not members themselves must channel their business
through a member and post margin with the member. The main task of the clearing
house is to keep track of all the transactions that take place during a day, so that it can
calculate the net position of each of its members.
The clearing house member is required to provide initial margin (sometimes referred to
as clearing margin) reﬂecting the total number of contracts that are being cleared. There
is no maintenance margin applicable to the clearing house member. Each day the
transactions being handled by the clearing house member are settled through the clearing
house. If in total the transactions have lost money, the member is required to provide
variation margin to the exchange clearing house; if there has been a gain on the
transactions, the member receives variation margin from the clearing house.
In determining initial margin, the number of contracts outstanding is usually
calculated on a net basis. This means that short positions the clearing house member
is handling for clients are oﬀset against long positions. Suppose, for example, that the
clearing house member has two clients: one with a long position in 20 contracts, the
other with a short position in 15 contracts. The initial margin would be calculated on
the basis of 5 contracts. Clearing house members are required to contribute to a
guaranty fund. This may be used by the clearing house in the event that a member
fails to provide variation margin when required to do so, and there are losses when the
member’s positions are closed out.
Credit Risk
The whole purpose of the margining system is to ensure that funds are available to pay
traders when they make a proﬁt. Overall the system has been very successful. Traders
entering into contracts at major exchanges have always had their contracts honored.
Futures markets were tested on October 19, 1987, when the S&P 500 index declined by
over 20% and traders with long positions in S&P 500 futures found they had negative
margin balances. Traders who did not meet margin calls were closed out but still owed
their brokers money. Some did not pay and as a result some brokers went bankrupt
because, without their clients’ money, they were unable to meet margin calls on
contracts they entered into on behalf of their clients. However, the clearing houses
had suﬃcient funds to ensure that everyone who had a short futures position on the
S&P 500 got paid oﬀ.
2.5
OTC MARKETS
Over-the-counter (OTC) markets, introduced in Chapter 1, are markets where compa-
nies agree to derivatives transactions without involving an exchange. Credit risk has
traditionally been a feature of OTC derivatives markets. Consider two companies, A
and B, that have entered into a number of derivatives transactions. If A defaults when
the net value of the outstanding transactions to B is positive, a loss is likely to be taken
by B. Similarly, if B defaults when the net value of outstanding transactions to A is
54
CHAPTER 2

positive, a loss is likely to be taken by company A. In an attempt to reduce credit risk,
the OTC market has borrowed some ideas from exchange-traded markets. We now
discuss this.
Central Counterparties
We brieﬂy mentioned CCPs in Section 1.2. These are clearing houses for standard OTC
transactions that perform much the same role as exchange clearing houses. Members of
the CCP, similarly to members of an exchange clearing house, have to provide both
initial margin and daily variation margin. Like members of an exchange clearing house,
they are also required to contribute to a guaranty fund.
Once an OTC derivative transaction has been agreed between two parties A and B, it
can be presented to a CCP. Assuming the CCP accepts the transaction, it becomes the
counterparty to both A and B. (This is similar to the way the clearing house for a
futures exchange becomes the counterparty to the two sides of a futures trade.) For
example, if the transaction is a forward contract where A has agreed to buy an asset
from B in one year for a certain price, the clearing house agrees to
1. Buy the asset from B in one year for the agreed price, and
2. Sell the asset to A in one year for the agreed price.
It takes on the credit risk of both A and B.
All members of the CCP are required to provide initial margin to the CCP.
Transactions are valued daily and there are daily variation margin payments to or
from the member. If an OTC market participant is not itself a member of a CCP, it can
arrange to clear its trades through a CCP member. It will then have to provide margin
to the CCP. Its relationship with the CCP member is similar to the relationship between
a broker and a futures exchange clearing house member.
Following the credit crisis that started in 2007, regulators have become more con-
cerned about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). One result of this, mentioned in
Section 1.2, has been legislation requiring that most standard OTC transactions between
ﬁnancial institutions be handled by CCPs.
Bilateral Clearing
Those OTC transactions that are not cleared through CCPs are cleared bilaterally. In
the bilaterally-cleared OTC market, two companies A and B usually enter into a master
agreement covering all their trades.3 This agreement often includes an annex, referred to
as the credit support annex or CSA, requiring A or B, or both, to provide collateral.
The collateral is similar to the margin required by exchange clearing houses or CCPs
from their members.
Collateral agreements in CSAs usually require transactions to be valued each day. A
simple two-way agreement between companies A and B might work as follows. If, from
one day to the next, the transactions between A and B increase in value to A by X (and
therefore decrease in value to B by X), B is required to provide collateral worth X to A.
If the reverse happens and the transactions increase in value to B by X (and decrease in
value to A by X), A is required to provide collateral worth X to B. (To use the
3 The most common such agreement is an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master
Agreement.
Mechanics of Futures Markets
55

terminology of exchange-traded markets, X is the variation margin provided.) Collateral
agreements and the way counterparty credit risk is assessed for bilaterally cleared
transactions is discussed further in Chapter 24.
It has traditionally been relatively rare for a CSA to require initial margin. This is
changing. New regulations introduced in 2012 require both initial margin and variation
margin to be provided for bilaterally cleared transactions between ﬁnancial institu-
tions.4 The initial margin will typically be segregated from other funds and posted with
a third party.
Collateral signiﬁcantly reduces credit risk in the bilaterally cleared OTC market (and
will do so even more when the new rules requiring initial margin for transactions
between ﬁnancial institutions come into force). Collateral agreements were used by
hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) for its bilaterally cleared deri-
vatives 1990s. The agreements allowed LTCM to be highly levered. They did provide
credit protection, but as described in Business Snapshot 2.2, the high leverage left the
hedge fund exposed to other risks.
Business Snapshot 2.2
Long-Term Capital Management’s Big Loss
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund formed in the mid-1990s,
always collateralized its bilaterally cleared transactions. The hedge fund’s investment
strategy was known as convergence arbitrage. A very simple example of what it might
do is the following. It would ﬁnd two bonds, X and Y, issued by the same company
that promised the same payoﬀs, with X being less liquid (i.e., less actively traded)
than Y. The market places a value on liquidity. As a result the price of X would be
less than the price of Y. LTCM would buy X, short Y, and wait, expecting the prices
of the two bonds to converge at some future time.
When interest rates increased, the company expected both bonds to move down in
price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it paid on bond X would be
about the same as the collateral it received on bond Y. Similarly, when interest rates
decreased, LTCM expected both bonds to move up in price by about the same
amount, so that the collateral it received on bond X would be about the same as the
collateral it paid on bond Y. It therefore expected that there would be no signiﬁcant
outﬂow of funds as a result of its collateralization agreements.
In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt and this led to what is termed a
‘‘ﬂight to quality’’ in capital markets. One result was that investors valued liquid
instruments more highly than usual and the spreads between the prices of the liquid
and illiquid instruments in LTCM’s portfolio increased dramatically. The prices of
the bonds LTCM had bought went down and the prices of those it had shorted
increased. It was required to post collateral on both. The company experienced
diﬃculties because it was highly leveraged. Positions had to be closed out and LTCM
lost about $4 billion. If the company had been less highly leveraged, it would
probably have been able to survive the ﬂight to quality and could have waited for
the prices of the liquid and illiquid bonds to move back closer to each other.
4 For both this regulation and the regulation requiring standard transactions between ﬁnancial institutions to
be cleared through CCPs, ‘‘ﬁnancial institutions’’ include banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and
hedge funds. Transactions with non-ﬁnancial institutions and some foreign exchange transactions are exempt
from the regulations.

CHAPTER 2

Figure 2.2 illustrates the way bilateral and central clearing work. (It makes the
simplifying assumption that there are only eight market participants and one CCP).
Under bilateral clearing there are many diﬀerent agreements between market partici-
pants, as indicated in Figure 2.2a. If all OTC contracts were cleared through a single
CCP, we would move to the situation shown in Figure 2.2b. In practice, because not all
OTC transactions are routed through CCPs and there is more than one CCP, the market
has elements of both Figure 2.2a and Figure 2.2b.5
Futures Trades vs. OTC Trades
Regardless of how transactions are cleared, initial margin when provided in the form of
cash usually earns interest. The daily variation margin provided by clearing house
members for futures contracts does not earn interest. This is because the variation
margin constitutes the daily settlement. Transactions in the OTC market, whether
cleared through CCPs or cleared bilaterally, are usually not settled daily. For this
reason, the daily variation margin that is provided by the member of a CCP or, as a
result of a CSA, earns interest when it is in the form of cash.
Securities can be often be used to satisfy margin/collateral requirements.6 The market
value of the securities is reduced by a certain amount to determine their value for
margin purposes. This reduction is known as a haircut.

cleared through them. See D. Duﬃe and H. Zhu, ‘‘Does a Central Clearing Counterparty Reduce
Counterparty Risk,’’ Review of Asset Pricing Studies, 1 (2011): 74–95.

CHAPTER 2

quoted are shown at the top of each section of Table 2.2. The ﬁrst asset is gold. The
contract size is 100 ounces and the price is quoted as dollars per ounce. The maturity
month of the contract is indicated in the ﬁrst column of the table.
Prices
The ﬁrst three numbers in each row of Table 2.2 show the opening price, the highest
price in trading so far during the day, and the lowest price in trading so far during the
day. The opening price is representative of the prices at which contracts were trading
immediately after the start of trading on May 14, 2013. For the June 2013 gold contract,
the opening price on May 14, 2013, was $1,429.5 per ounce. The highest price during the
day was $1,444.9 per ounce and the lowest price during the day was $1,419.7 per ounce.
Settlement Price
The settlement price is the price used for calculating daily gains and losses and margin
requirements. It is usually calculated as the price at which the contract traded im-
mediately before the end of a day’s trading session. The fourth number in Table 2.2
shows the settlement price the previous day (i.e., May 13, 2013). The ﬁfth number
shows the most recent trading price, and the sixth number shows the price change from
the previous day’s settlement price. In the case of the June 2013 gold contract, the
previous day’s settlement price was $1,434.3. The most recent trade was at $1,425.3,
$9.0 lower than the previous day’s settlement price. If $1,425.3 proved to be the
settlement price on May 14, 2013, the margin account of a trader with a long position
in one contract would lose $900 on May 14 and the margin account of a trader with a
short position would gain this amount on May 14.
Trading Volume and Open Interest
The ﬁnal column of Table 2.2 shows the trading volume. The trading volume is the
number of contracts traded in a day. It can be contrasted with the open interest, which is
the number of contracts outstanding, that is, the number of long positions or, equiva-
lently, the number of short positions.
If there is a large amount of trading by day traders (i.e, traders who enter into a
position and close it out on the same day), the volume of trading in a day can be greater
than either the beginning-of-day or end-of-day open interest.
Patterns of Futures
Futures prices can show a number of diﬀerent patterns. In Table 2.2, gold, wheat, and
live cattle settlement futures prices are an increasing function of the maturity of the
contract. This is known as a normal market. The situation where settlement futures
prices decline with maturity is referred as an inverted market.7 Commodities such as
crude oil, corn, and soybeans showed patterns that were partly normal and partly
inverted on May 14, 2013.
7 The term contango is sometimes used to describe the situation where the futures price is an increasing function
of maturity and the term backwardation is sometimes used to describe the situation where the futures price is a
decreasing function of the maturity of the contract. Strictly speaking, as will be explained in Chapter 5, these
terms refer to whether the price of the underlying asset is expected to increase or decrease over time.

2.7
DELIVERY
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, very few of the futures contracts that are entered
into lead to delivery of the underlying asset. Most are closed out early. Nevertheless, it
is the possibility of eventual delivery that determines the futures price. An under-
standing of delivery procedures is therefore important.
The period during which delivery can be made is deﬁned by the exchange and varies
from contract to contract. The decision on when to deliver is made by the party with
the short position, whom we shall refer to as investor A. When investor A decides to
deliver, investor A’s broker issues a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange
clearing house. This notice states how many contracts will be delivered and, in the case
of commodities, also speciﬁes where delivery will be made and what grade will be
delivered. The exchange then chooses a party with a long position to accept delivery.
Suppose that the party on the other side of investor A’s futures contract when it was
entered into was investor B. It is important to realize that there is no reason to expect
that it will be investor B who takes delivery. Investor B may well have closed out his or
her position by trading with investor C, investor C may have closed out his or her
position by trading with investor D, and so on. The usual rule chosen by the exchange
is to pass the notice of intention to deliver on to the party with the oldest outstanding
long position. Parties with long positions must accept delivery notices. However, if the
notices are transferable, long investors have a short period of time, usually half an
hour, to ﬁnd another party with a long position that is prepared to take delivery in
place of them.
In the case of a commodity, taking delivery usually means accepting a warehouse
receipt in return for immediate payment. The party taking delivery is then responsible
for all warehousing costs. In the case of livestock futures, there may be costs associated
with feeding and looking after the animals (see Business Snapshot 2.1). In the case of
ﬁnancial futures, delivery is usually made by wire transfer. For all contracts, the price
paid is usually the most recent settlement price. If speciﬁed by the exchange, this price is
adjusted for grade, location of delivery, and so on. The whole delivery procedure from
the issuance of the notice of intention to deliver to the delivery itself generally takes
about two to three days.
There are three critical days for a contract. These are the ﬁrst notice day, the last
notice day, and the last trading day. The ﬁrst notice day is the ﬁrst day on which a notice
of intention to make delivery can be submitted to the exchange. The last notice day is
the last such day. The last trading day is generally a few days before the last notice day.
To avoid the risk of having to take delivery, an investor with a long position should
close out his or her contracts prior to the ﬁrst notice day.
Cash Settlement
Some ﬁnancial futures, such as those on stock indices discussed in Chapter 3, are settled
in cash because it is inconvenient or impossible to deliver the underlying asset. In the
case of the futures contract on the S&P 500, for example, delivering the underlying asset
would involve delivering a portfolio of 500 stocks. When a contract is settled in cash, all
outstanding contracts are declared closed on a predetermined day. The ﬁnal settlement
price is set equal to the spot price of the underlying asset at either the open or close of
trading on that day. For example, in the S&P 500 futures contract traded by the CME
60
CHAPTER 2

Group, the predetermined day is the third Friday of the delivery month and ﬁnal
settlement is at the opening price.
2.8
TYPES OF TRADERS AND TYPES OF ORDERS
There are two main types of traders executing trades: futures commission merchants
(FCMs) and locals. FCMs are following the instructions of their clients and charge a
commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.
Individuals taking positions, whether locals or the clients of FCMs, can be categor-
ized as hedgers, speculators, or arbitrageurs, as discussed in Chapter 1. Speculators can
be classiﬁed as scalpers, day traders, or position traders. Scalpers are watching for very
short-term trends and attempt to proﬁt from small changes in the contract price. They
usually hold their positions for only a few minutes. Day traders hold their positions for
less than one trading day. They are unwilling to take the risk that adverse news will
occur overnight. Position traders hold their positions for much longer periods of time.
They hope to make signiﬁcant proﬁts from major movements in the markets.
Orders
The simplest type of order placed with a broker is a market order. It is a request that a
trade be carried out immediately at the best price available in the market. However, there
are many other types of orders. We will consider those that are more commonly used.
A limit order speciﬁes a particular price. The order can be executed only at this price or
at one more favorable to the investor. Thus, if the limit price is $30 for an investor
wanting to buy, the order will be executed only at a price of $30 or less. There is, of
course, no guarantee that the order will be executed at all, because the limit price may
never be reached.
A stop order or stop-loss order also speciﬁes a particular price. The order is executed
at the best available price once a bid or oﬀer is made at that particular price or a less-
favorable price. Suppose a stop order to sell at $30 is issued when the market price
is $35. It becomes an order to sell when and if the price falls to $30. In eﬀect, a stop
order becomes a market order as soon as the speciﬁed price has been hit. The purpose
of a stop order is usually to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take
place. It limits the loss that can be incurred.
A stop–limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. The order
becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or oﬀer is made at a price equal to or less
favorable than the stop price. Two prices must be speciﬁed in a stop–limit order: the stop
price and the limit price. Suppose that at the time the market price is $35, a stop–limit
order to buy is issued with a stop price of $40 and a limit price of $41. As soon as there is
a bid or oﬀer at $40, the stop–limit becomes a limit order at $41. If the stop price and the
limit price are the same, the order is sometimes called a stop-and-limit order.
A market-if-touched (MIT) order is executed at the best available price after a trade
occurs at a speciﬁed price or at a price more favorable than the speciﬁed price. In eﬀect,
an MIT becomes a market order once the speciﬁed price has been hit. An MIT is also
known as a board order. Consider an investor who has a long position in a futures
contract and is issuing instructions that would lead to closing out the contract. A stop
order is designed to place a limit on the loss that can occur in the event of unfavorable
Mechanics of Futures Markets
61

price movements. By contrast, a market-if-touched order is designed to ensure that
proﬁts are taken if suﬃciently favorable price movements occur.
A discretionary order or market-not-held order is traded as a market order except
that execution may be delayed at the broker’s discretion in an attempt to get a better
price.
Some orders specify time conditions. Unless otherwise stated, an order is a day order
and expires at the end of the trading day. A time-of-day order speciﬁes a particular
period of time during the day when the order can be executed. An open order or a good-
till-canceled order is in eﬀect until executed or until the end of trading in the particular
contract. A ﬁll-or-kill order, as its name implies, must be executed immediately on
receipt or not at all.
2.9
REGULATION
Futures markets in the United States are currently regulated federally by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC; www.cftc.gov), which was established in 1974.
The CFTC looks after the public interest. It is responsible for ensuring that prices are
communicated to the public and that futures traders report their outstanding positions
if they are above certain levels. The CFTC also licenses all individuals who oﬀer their
services to the public in futures trading. The backgrounds of these individuals are
investigated, and there are minimum capital requirements. The CFTC deals with
complaints brought by the public and ensures that disciplinary action is taken against
individuals when appropriate. It has the authority to force exchanges to take disciplin-
ary action against members who are in violation of exchange rules.
With the formation of the National Futures Association (NFA; www.nfa.futures.
org) in 1982, some of responsibilities of the CFTC were shifted to the futures industry
itself. The NFA is an organization of individuals who participate in the futures
industry. Its objective is to prevent fraud and to ensure that the market operates in
the best interests of the general public. It is authorized to monitor trading and take
disciplinary action when appropriate. The agency has set up an eﬃcient system for
arbitrating disputes between individuals and its members.
The Dodd–Frank act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, expanded the
role of the CFTC. It is now responsible for rules requiring that standard over-the-
counter derivatives be traded on swap execution facilities and cleared through central
counterparties.
Trading Irregularities
Most of the time futures markets operate eﬃciently and in the public interest. However,
from time to time, trading irregularities do come to light. One type of trading
irregularity occurs when an investor group tries to ‘‘corner the market.’’ 8 The investor
group takes a huge long futures position and also tries to exercise some control over the
supply of the underlying commodity. As the maturity of the futures contracts is
8 Possibly the best known example of this was the attempt by the Hunt brothers to corner the silver market in
1979–80. Between the middle of 1979 and the beginning of 1980, their activities led to a price rise from $6 per
ounce to $50 per ounce.
62
CHAPTER 2

approached, the investor group does not close out its position, so that the number of
outstanding futures contracts may exceed the amount of the commodity available for
delivery. The holders of short positions realize that they will ﬁnd it diﬃcult to deliver
and become desperate to close out their positions. The result is a large rise in both
futures and spot prices. Regulators usually deal with this type of abuse of the market by
increasing margin requirements or imposing stricter position limits or prohibiting trades
that increase a speculator’s open position or requiring market participants to close out
their positions.
Other types of trading irregularity can involve the traders on the ﬂoor of the
exchange. These received some publicity early in 1989, when it was announced that
the FBI had carried out a two-year investigation, using undercover agents, of trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The investigation
was initiated because of complaints ﬁled by a large agricultural concern. The alleged
oﬀenses included overcharging customers, not paying customers the full proceeds of
sales, and traders using their knowledge of customer orders to trade ﬁrst for themselves
(an oﬀence known as front running).
2.10
ACCOUNTING AND TAX
The full details of the accounting and tax treatment of futures contracts are beyond the
scope of this book. A trader who wants detailed information on this should obtain
professional advice. This section provides some general background information.
Accounting
Accounting standards require changes in the market value of a futures contract to be
recognized when they occur unless the contract qualiﬁes as a hedge. If the contract does
qualify as a hedge, gains or losses are generally recognized for accounting purposes in
the same period in which the gains or losses from the item being hedged are recognized.
The latter treatment is referred to as hedge accounting.
Consider a company with a December year end. In September 2014 it buys a March
2015 corn futures contract and closes out the position at the end of February 2015.
Suppose that the futures prices are 650 cents per bushel when the contract is entered
into, 670 cents per bushel at the end of 2014, and 680 cents per bushel when the
contract is closed out. The contract is for the delivery of 5,000 bushels. If the contract
does not qualify as a hedge, the gains for accounting purposes are
5,000  ð6:70  6:50Þ ¼ $1,000
in 2014 and
5,000  ð6:80  6:70Þ ¼ $500
in 2015. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February
2015 so that the contract qualiﬁes for hedge accounting, the entire gain of $1,500 is
realized in 2015 for accounting purposes.
The treatment of hedging gains and losses is sensible. If the company is hedging the
purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2015, the eﬀect of the futures contract is
to ensure that the price paid is close to 650 cents per bushel. The accounting treatment
reﬂects that this price is paid in 2015.
Mechanics of Futures Markets
63

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133
(FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. FAS 133
applies to all types of derivatives (including futures, forwards, swaps, and options). It
requires all derivatives to be included on the balance sheet at fair market value.9 It
increases disclosure requirements. It also gives companies far less latitude than previously
in using hedge accounting. For hedge accounting to be used, the hedging instrument
must be highly eﬀective in oﬀsetting exposures and an assessment of this eﬀectiveness is
required every three months. A similar standard, IAS 39, has been issued by the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board.
Tax
Under the US tax rules, two key issues are the nature of a taxable gain or loss and the
timing of the recognition of the gain or loss. Gains or losses are either classiﬁed as
capital gains or losses or alternatively as part of ordinary income.
For a corporate taxpayer, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income,
and the ability to deduct losses is restricted. Capital losses are deductible only to the
extent of capital gains. A corporation may carry back a capital loss for three years and
carry it forward for up to ﬁve years. For a noncorporate taxpayer, short-term capital
gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, but long-term capital gains are
subject to a maximum capital gains tax rate of 15%. (Long-term capital gains are gains
from the sale of a capital asset held for longer than one year; short-term capital gains
are the gains from the sale of a capital asset held one year or less.) For a noncorporate
taxpayer, capital losses are deductible to the extent of capital gains plus ordinary
income up to $3,000 and can be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
Generally, positions in futures contracts are treated as if they are closed out on the
last day of the tax year. For the noncorporate taxpayer, this gives rise to capital gains
and losses that are treated as if they were 60% long term and 40% short term without
regard to the holding period. This is referred to as the ‘‘60/40’’ rule. A noncorporate
taxpayer may elect to carry back for three years any net losses from the 60/40 rule to
oﬀset any gains recognized under the rule in the previous three years.
Hedging transactions are exempt from this rule. The deﬁnition of a hedge transaction
for tax purposes is diﬀerent from that for accounting purposes. The tax regulations
deﬁne a hedging transaction as a transaction entered into in the normal course of
business primarily for one of the following reasons:
1. To reduce the risk of price changes or currency ﬂuctuations with respect to
property that is held or to be held by the taxpayer for the purposes of producing
ordinary income
2. To reduce the risk of price or interest rate changes or currency ﬂuctuations with
respect to borrowings made by the taxpayer.
A hedging transaction must be clearly identiﬁed in a timely manner in the company’s
records as a hedge. Gains or losses from hedging transactions are treated as ordinary
income. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses from hedging transactions
generally matches the timing of the recognition of income or expense associated with
the transaction being hedged.
9 Previously the attraction of derivatives in some situations was that they were ‘‘oﬀ-balance-sheet’’ items.

2.11
FORWARD vs. FUTURES CONTRACTS
The main diﬀerences between forward and futures contracts are summarized in Table 2.3.
Both contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain future
time. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and there is no
standard contract size or standard delivery arrangements. A single delivery date is usually
speciﬁed and the contract is usually held to the end of its life and then settled. A futures
contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange. A range of delivery dates is
usually speciﬁed. It is settled daily and usually closed out prior to maturity.
Proﬁts from Forward and Futures Contracts
Suppose that the sterling exchange rate for a 90-day forward contract is 1.5000 and that
this rate is also the futures price for a contract that will be delivered in exactly 90 days.
What is the diﬀerence between the gains and losses under the two contracts?
Under the forward contract, the whole gain or loss is realized at the end of the life
of the contract. Under the futures contract, the gain or loss is realized day by day
because of the daily settlement procedures. Suppose that trader A is long £1 million in
a 90-day forward contract and trader B is long £1 million in 90-day futures contracts.
(Because each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of £62,500, trader B must
purchase a total of 16 contracts.) Assume that the spot exchange rate in 90 days
proves to be 1.7000 dollars per pound. Trader A makes a gain of $200,000 on the 90th
day. Trader B makes the same gain—but spread out over the 90-day period. On some
days trader B may realize a loss, whereas on other days he or she makes a gain.
However, in total, when losses are netted against gains, there is a gain of $200,000
over the 90-day period.
Foreign Exchange Quotes
Both forward and futures contracts trade actively on foreign currencies. However,
there is sometimes a diﬀerence in the way exchange rates are quoted in the two
markets. For example, futures prices where one currency is the US dollar are always
quoted as the number of US dollars per unit of the foreign currency or as the number

of US cents per unit of the foreign currency. Forward prices are always quoted in the
same way as spot prices. This means that, for the British pound, the euro, the
Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar, the forward quotes show the number
of US dollars per unit of the foreign currency and are directly comparable with futures
quotes. For other major currencies, forward quotes show the number of units of the
foreign currency per US dollar (USD). Consider the Canadian dollar (CAD). A
futures price quote of 0.9500 USD per CAD corresponds to a forward price quote
of 1.0526 CAD per USD (1:0526 ¼ 1=0:9500).
SUMMARY
A very high proportion of the futures contracts that are traded do not lead to the
delivery of the underlying asset. Traders usually enter into oﬀsetting contracts to close
out their positions before the delivery period is reached. However, it is the possibility of
ﬁnal delivery that drives the determination of the futures price. For each futures
contract, there is a range of days during which delivery can be made and a well-deﬁned
delivery procedure. Some contracts, such as those on stock indices, are settled in cash
rather than by delivery of the underlying asset.
The speciﬁcation of contracts is an important activity for a futures exchange. The two
sides to any contract must know what can be delivered, where delivery can take place,
and when delivery can take place. They also need to know details on the trading hours,
how prices will be quoted, maximum daily price movements, and so on. New contracts
must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before trading
starts.
Margin accounts are an important aspect of futures markets. An investor keeps a
margin account with his or her broker. The account is adjusted daily to reﬂect gains or
losses, and from time to time the broker may require the account to be topped up if
adverse price movements have taken place. The broker either must be a clearing house
member or must maintain a margin account with a clearing house member. Each
clearing house member maintains a margin account with the exchange clearing house.
The balance in the account is adjusted daily to reﬂect gains and losses on the business
for which the clearing house member is responsible.
In over-the-counter derivatives markets, transactions are cleared either bilaterally or
centrally. When bilateral clearing is used, collateral frequently has to be posted by one
or both parties to reduced credit risk. When central clearing is used, a central counter-
party (CCP) stands between the two sides. It requires each side to provide margin and
performs much the same function as an exchange clearing house.
Forward contracts diﬀer from futures contracts in a number of ways. Forward
contracts are private arrangements between two parties, whereas futures contracts are
traded on exchanges. There is generally a single delivery date in a forward contract,
whereas futures contracts frequently involve a range of such dates. Because they are not
traded on exchanges, forward contracts do not need to be standardized. A forward
contract is not usually settled until the end of its life, and most contracts do in fact lead
to delivery of the underlying asset or a cash settlement at this time.
In the next few chapters we shall examine in more detail the ways in which forward
and futures contracts can be used for hedging. We shall also look at how forward and
futures prices are determined.

Further Questions
2.27. Trader A enters into futures contracts to buy 1 million euros for 1.3 million dollars in
three months. Trader B enters in a forward contract to do the same thing. The exchange
rate (dollars per euro) declines sharply during the ﬁrst two months and then increases for

the month preceding the delivery month? On a particular day, there were 2,000 trades in a
particular futures contract. This means that there were 2,000 buyers (going long) and 2,000
sellers (going short). Of the 2,000 buyers, 1,400 were closing out positions and 600 were
entering into new positions. Of the 2,000 sellers, 1,200 were closing out positions and 800

situations?
(a) The transactions are cleared bilaterally and are subject to one-way collateral agreements

for crude oil and answer the following:
(a) Assuming that daily price changes are normally distributed with zero mean, estimate
the daily price movement that will not be exceeded with 99% conﬁdence.
(b) Suppose that an exchange wants to set the maintenance margin for traders so that it is
99% certain that the margin will not be wiped out by a two-day price move. (It
chooses two days because the margin calls are made at the end of a day and the trader
has until the end of the next day to decide whether to provide more margin.) How
high does the margin have to be when the normal distribution assumption is made?
(c) Suppose that the maintenance margin is as calculated in (b) and is 75% of the initial
margin. How frequently would the margin have been wiped out by a two-day price
movement in the period covered by the data for a trader with a long position? What do
your results suggest about the appropriateness of the normal distribution assumption?

CHAPTER 2

Hedging Strategies
Using Futures
Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures
markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. This risk might relate to ﬂuctuations
in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the level of the stock market, or some other
variable. A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are
rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study
of the ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfect
as possible.
In this chapter we consider a number of general issues associated with the way hedges
are set up. When is a short futures position appropriate? When is a long futures
position appropriate? Which futures contract should be used? What is the optimal size
of the futures position for reducing risk? At this stage, we restrict our attention to what
might be termed hedge-and-forget strategies. We assume that no attempt is made to
adjust the hedge once it has been put in place. The hedger simply takes a futures
position at the beginning of the life of the hedge and closes out the position at the end
of the life of the hedge. In Chapter 19 we will examine dynamic hedging strategies in
which the hedge is monitored closely and frequent adjustments are made.
The chapter initially treats futures contracts as forward contracts (that is, it ignores
daily settlement). Later it explains an adjustment known as ‘‘tailing’’ that takes account
of the diﬀerence between futures and forwards.
3.1
BASIC PRINCIPLES
When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the
objective is usually to take a position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible.
Consider a company that knows it will gain $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the
price of a commodity over the next 3 months and lose $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease
in the price during the same period. To hedge, the company’s treasurer should take a
short futures position that is designed to oﬀset this risk. The futures position should
lead to a loss of $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of the commodity over
the 3 months and a gain of $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this
period. If the price of the commodity goes down, the gain on the futures position
oﬀsets the loss on the rest of the company’s business. If the price of the commodity
71
3
C H A P T E R

goes up, the loss on the futures position is oﬀset by the gain on the rest of the
company’s business.
Short Hedges
A short hedge is a hedge, such as the one just described, that involves a short position in
futures contracts. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset
and expects to sell it at some time in the future. For example, a short hedge could be
used by a farmer who owns some hogs and knows that they will be ready for sale at the
local market in two months. A short hedge can also be used when an asset is not owned
right now but will be owned at some time in the future. Consider, for example, a US
exporter who knows that he or she will receive euros in 3 months. The exporter will
realize a gain if the euro increases in value relative to the US dollar and will sustain a
loss if the euro decreases in value relative to the US dollar. A short futures position
leads to a loss if the euro increases in value and a gain if it decreases in value. It has the
eﬀect of oﬀsetting the exporter’s risk.
To provide a more detailed illustration of the operation of a short hedge in a speciﬁc
situation, we assume that it is May 15 today and that an oil producer has just negotiated
a contract to sell 1 million barrels of crude oil. It has been agreed that the price that will
apply in the contract is the market price on August 15. The oil producer is therefore in
the position where it will gain $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of oil over the
next 3 months and lose $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period.
Suppose that on May 15 the spot price is $80 per barrel and the crude oil futures price
for August delivery is $79 per barrel. Because each futures contract is for the delivery of
1,000 barrels, the company can hedge its exposure by shorting (i.e., selling) 1,000
futures contracts. If the oil producer closes out its position on August 15, the eﬀect
of the strategy should be to lock in a price close to $79 per barrel.
To illustrate what might happen, suppose that the spot price on August 15 proves to
be $75 per barrel. The company realizes $75 million for the oil under its sales contract.
Because August is the delivery month for the futures contract, the futures price on
August 15 should be very close to the spot price of $75 on that date. The company
therefore gains approximately
$79  $75 ¼ $4
per barrel, or $4 million in total from the short futures position. The total amount
realized from both the futures position and the sales contract is therefore approximately
$79 per barrel, or $79 million in total.
For an alternative outcome, suppose that the price of oil on August 15 proves to be
$85 per barrel. The company realizes $85 per barrel for the oil and loses approximately
$85  $79 ¼ $6
per barrel on the short futures position. Again, the total amount realized is approxi-
mately $79 million. It is easy to see that in all cases the company ends up with
approximately $79 million.
Long Hedges
Hedges that involve taking a long position in a futures contract are known as long
hedges. A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a
certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.
72
CHAPTER 3

Suppose that it is now January 15. A copper fabricator knows it will require 100,000
pounds of copper on May 15 to meet a certain contract. The spot price of copper is
340 cents per pound, and the futures price for May delivery is 320 cents per pound. The
fabricator can hedge its position by taking a long position in four futures contracts
oﬀered by the COMEX division of the CME Group and closing its position on May 15.
Each contract is for the delivery of 25,000 pounds of copper. The strategy has the eﬀect
of locking in the price of the required copper at close to 320 cents per pound.
Suppose that the spot price of copper on May 15 proves to be 325 cents per pound.
Because May is the delivery month for the futures contract, this should be very close to
the futures price. The fabricator therefore gains approximately
100,000  ð$3:25  $3:20Þ ¼ $5,000
on the futures contracts. It pays 100,000  $3:25 ¼ $325,000 for the copper, making the
net cost approximately $325,000  $5,000 ¼ $320,000. For an alternative outcome,
suppose that the spot price is 305 cents per pound on May 15. The fabricator then
loses approximately
100,000  ð$3:20  $3:05Þ ¼ $15,000
on the futures contract and pays 100,000  $3:05 ¼ $305,000 for the copper. Again, the
net cost is approximately $320,000, or 320 cents per pound.
Note that, in this case, it is clearly better for the company to use futures contracts
than to buy the copper on January 15 in the spot market. If it does the latter, it will pay
340 cents per pound instead of 320 cents per pound and will incur both interest costs
and storage costs. For a company using copper on a regular basis, this disadvantage
would be oﬀset by the convenience of having the copper on hand.1 However, for a
company that knows it will not require the copper until May 15, the futures contract
alternative is likely to be preferred.
The examples we have looked at assume that the futures position is closed out in the
delivery month. The hedge has the same basic eﬀect if delivery is allowed to happen.
However, making or taking delivery can be costly and inconvenient. For this reason,
delivery is not usually made even when the hedger keeps the futures contract until the
delivery month. As will be discussed later, hedgers with long positions usually avoid
any possibility of having to take delivery by closing out their positions before the
delivery period.
We have also assumed in the two examples that there is no daily settlement. In
practice, daily settlement does have a small eﬀect on the performance of a hedge. As
explained in Chapter 2, it means that the payoﬀfrom the futures contract is realized day
by day throughout the life of the hedge rather than all at the end.
3.2
ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST HEDGING
The arguments in favor of hedging are so obvious that they hardly need to be stated.
Most nonﬁnancial companies are in the business of manufacturing, or retailing or
wholesaling, or providing a service. They have no particular skills or expertise in
predicting variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. It
1 See Section 5.11 for a discussion of convenience yields.
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
73

makes sense for them to hedge the risks associated with these variables as they become
aware of them. The companies can then focus on their main activities—for which
presumably they do have particular skills and expertise. By hedging, they avoid un-
pleasant surprises such as sharp rises in the price of a commodity that is being purchased.
In practice, many risks are left unhedged. In the rest of this section we will explore
some of the reasons for this.
Hedging and Shareholders
One argument sometimes put forward is that the shareholders can, if they wish, do the
hedging themselves. They do not need the company to do it for them. This argument is,
however, open to question. It assumes that shareholders have as much information as the
company’s management about the risks faced by a company. In most instances, this is
not the case. The argument also ignores commissions and other transactions costs. These
are less expensive per dollar of hedging for large transactions than for small transactions.
Hedging is therefore likely to be less expensive when carried out by the company than
when it is carried out by individual shareholders. Indeed, the size of futures contracts
makes hedging by individual shareholders impossible in many situations.
One thing that shareholders can do far more easily than a corporation is diversify
risk. A shareholder with a well-diversiﬁed portfolio may be immune to many of the
risks faced by a corporation. For example, in addition to holding shares in a company
that uses copper, a well-diversiﬁed shareholder may hold shares in a copper producer,
so that there is very little overall exposure to the price of copper. If companies are acting
in the best interests of well-diversiﬁed shareholders, it can be argued that hedging is
unnecessary in many situations. However, the extent to which managers are in practice
inﬂuenced by this type of argument is open to question.
Hedging and Competitors
If hedging is not the norm in a certain industry, it may not make sense for one
particular company to choose to be diﬀerent from all others. Competitive pressures
within the industry may be such that the prices of the goods and services produced by
the industry ﬂuctuate to reﬂect raw material costs, interest rates, exchange rates, and so
on. A company that does not hedge can expect its proﬁt margins to be roughly
constant. However, a company that does hedge can expect its proﬁt margins to
ﬂuctuate!
To illustrate this point, consider two manufacturers of gold jewelry, SafeandSure
Company and TakeaChance Company. We assume that most companies in the industry
do not hedge against movements in the price of gold and that TakeaChance Company is
no exception. However, SafeandSure Company has decided to be diﬀerent from its
competitors and to use futures contracts to hedge its purchase of gold over the next
18 months. If the price of gold goes up, economic pressures will tend to lead to a
corresponding increase in the wholesale price of jewelry, so that TakeaChance Company’s
gross proﬁt margin is unaﬀected. By contrast, SafeandSure Company’s proﬁt margin will
increase after the eﬀects of the hedge have been taken into account. If the price of gold
goes down, economic pressures will tend to lead to a corresponding decrease in the
wholesale price of jewelry. Again, TakeaChance Company’s proﬁt margin is unaﬀected.
However, SafeandSure Company’s proﬁt margin goes down. In extreme conditions,
74
CHAPTER 3

SafeandSure Company’s proﬁt margin could become negative as a result of the ‘‘hedging’’
carried out! The situation is summarized in Table 3.1.
This example emphasizes the importance of looking at the big picture when hedging.
All the implications of price changes on a company’s proﬁtability should be taken into
account in the design of a hedging strategy to protect against the price changes.
Hedging Can Lead to a Worse Outcome
It is important to realize that a hedge using futures contracts can result in a decrease or
an increase in a company’s proﬁts relative to the position it would be in with no
hedging. In the example involving the oil producer considered earlier, if the price of oil
goes down, the company loses money on its sale of 1 million barrels of oil, and the
futures position leads to an oﬀsetting gain. The treasurer can be congratulated for
having had the foresight to put the hedge in place. Clearly, the company is better oﬀ
than it would be with no hedging. Other executives in the organization, it is hoped, will
appreciate the contribution made by the treasurer. If the price of oil goes up, the
company gains from its sale of the oil, and the futures position leads to an oﬀsetting
loss. The company is in a worse position than it would be with no hedging. Although
the hedging decision was perfectly logical, the treasurer may in practice have a diﬃcult
time justifying it. Suppose that the price of oil at the end of the hedge is $89, so that the
company loses $10 per barrel on the futures contract. We can imagine a conversation
such as the following between the treasurer and the president:
President:
This is terrible. We’ve lost $10 million in the futures market in the space
of three months. How could it happen? I want a full explanation.
Treasurer:
The purpose of the futures contracts was to hedge our exposure to the
price of oil, not to make a proﬁt. Don’t forget we made $10 million
from the favorable eﬀect of the oil price increases on our business.
President:
What’s that got to do with it? That’s like saying that we do not need
to worry when our sales are down in California because they are up in
New York.
Treasurer:
If the price of oil had gone down . . .
President:
I don’t care what would have happened if the price of oil had gone
down. The fact is that it went up. I really do not know what you were
doing playing the futures markets like this. Our shareholders will
expect us to have done particularly well this quarter. I’m going to have
to explain to them that your actions reduced proﬁts by $10 million. I’m
afraid this is going to mean no bonus for you this year.

Treasurer:

Treasurer:
It all depends on how you look at it . . .
It is easy to see why many treasurers are reluctant to hedge! Hedging reduces risk for the
company. However, it may increase risk for the treasurer if others do not fully under-
stand what is being done. The only real solution to this problem involves ensuring that
all senior executives within the organization fully understand the nature of hedging
before a hedging program is put in place. Ideally, hedging strategies are set by a
company’s board of directors and are clearly communicated to both the company’s
management and the shareholders. (See Business Snapshot 3.1 for a discussion of
hedging by gold mining companies.)
3.3
BASIS RISK
The hedges in the examples considered so far have been almost too good to be true. The
hedger was able to identify the precise date in the future when an asset would be bought
or sold. The hedger was then able to use futures contracts to remove almost all the risk
arising from the price of the asset on that date. In practice, hedging is often not quite as
straightforward as this. Some of the reasons are as follows:
1. The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset
underlying the futures contract.
Business Snapshot 3.1
Hedging by Gold Mining Companies
It is natural for a gold mining company to consider hedging against changes in the
price of gold. Typically it takes
several years to extract all the gold from a mine.
Once a gold mining company decides to go ahead with production at a particular
mine, it has a big exposure to the price of gold. Indeed a mine that looks proﬁtable at
the outset could become unproﬁtable if the price of gold plunges.
Gold mining companies are careful to explain their hedging strategies to potential
shareholders. Some gold mining companies do not hedge. They tend to attract
shareholders who buy gold stocks because they want to beneﬁt when the price of
gold increases and are prepared to accept the risk of a loss from a decrease in the
price of gold. Other companies choose to hedge. They estimate the number of ounces
of gold they will produce each month for the next few years and enter into short
futures or forward contracts to lock in the price for all or part of this.
Suppose you are Goldman Sachs and are approached by a gold mining company
that wants to sell you a large amount of gold in 1 year at a ﬁxed price. How do you
set the price and then hedge your risk? The answer is that you can hedge by
borrowing the gold from a central bank, selling it immediately in the spot market,
and investing the proceeds at the risk-free rate. At the end of the year, you buy the
gold from the gold mining company and use it to repay the central bank. The ﬁxed
forward price you set for the gold reﬂects the risk-free rate you can earn and the lease
rate you pay the central bank for borrowing the gold.
76
CHAPTER 3

2. The hedger may be uncertain as to the exact date when the asset will be bought
or sold.
3. The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery
month.
These problems give rise to what is termed basis risk. This concept will now be explained.
The Basis
The basis in a hedging situation is as follows:2
Basis ¼ Spot price of asset to be hedged  Futures price of contract used
If the asset to be hedged and the asset underlying the futures contract are the same, the
basis should be zero at the expiration of the futures contract. Prior to expiration, the basis
may be positive or negative. From Table 2.2, we see that, on May 14, 2013, the basis was
negative for gold and positive for short maturity contracts on corn and soybeans.
As time passes, the spot price and the futures price for a particular month do not
necessarily change by the same amount. As a result, the basis changes. An increase in
the basis is referred to as a strengthening of the basis; a decrease in the basis is referred
to as a weakening of the basis. Figure 3.1 illustrates how a basis might change over time
in a situation where the basis is positive prior to expiration of the futures contract.
To examine the nature of basis risk, we will use the following notation:
S1: Spot price at time t1
S2: Spot price at time t2
F1: Futures price at time t1
F2: Futures price at time t2
b1: Basis at time t1
b2: Basis at time t2.

sometimes used, particularly when the futures contract is on a ﬁnancial asset.
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
77

We will assume that a hedge is put in place at time t1 and closed out at time t2. As an
example, we will consider the case where the spot and futures prices at the time the
hedge is initiated are $2.50 and $2.20, respectively, and that at the time the hedge is
closed out they are $2.00 and $1.90, respectively. This means that S1 ¼ 2:50, F1 ¼ 2:20,
S2 ¼ 2:00, and F2 ¼ 1:90.
From the deﬁnition of the basis, we have
b1 ¼ S1  F1
and
b2 ¼ S2  F2
so that, in our example, b1 ¼ 0:30 and b2 ¼ 0:10.
Consider ﬁrst the situation of a hedger who knows that the asset will be sold at time t2
and takes a short futures position at time t1. The price realized for the asset is S2 and the
proﬁt on the futures position is F1  F2. The eﬀective price that is obtained for the asset
with hedging is therefore
S2 þ F1  F2 ¼ F1 þ b2
In our example, this is $2.30. The value of F1 is known at time t1. If b2 were also known
at this time, a perfect hedge would result. The hedging risk is the uncertainty associated
with b2 and is known as basis risk. Consider next a situation where a company knows it
will buy the asset at time t2 and initiates a long hedge at time t1. The price paid for the
asset is S2 and the loss on the hedge is F1  F2. The eﬀective price that is paid with
hedging is therefore
S2 þ F1  F2 ¼ F1 þ b2
This is the same expression as before and is $2.30 in the example. The value of F1 is
known at time t1, and the term b2 represents basis risk.
Note that basis changes can lead to an improvement or a worsening of a hedger’s
position. Consider a company that uses a short hedge because it plans to sell the
underlying asset. If the basis strengthens (i.e., increases) unexpectedly, the company’s
position improves because it will get a higher price for the asset after futures gains or
losses are considered; if the basis weakens (i.e., decreases) unexpectedly, the company’s
position worsens. For a company using a long hedge because it plans to buy the asset,
the reverse holds. If the basis strengthens unexpectedly, the company’s position worsens
because it will pay a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are
considered; if the basis weakens unexpectedly, the company’s position improves.
The asset that gives rise to the hedger’s exposure is sometimes diﬀerent from the
asset underlying the futures contract that is used for hedging. This is known as cross
hedging and is discussed in the next section. It leads to an increase in basis risk. Deﬁne
S
2 as the price of the asset underlying the futures contract at time t2. As before, S2 is
the price of the asset being hedged at time t2. By hedging, a company ensures that the
price that will be paid (or received) for the asset is
S2 þ F1  F2
This can be written as
F1 þ ðS
2  F2Þ þ ðS2  S
2Þ
The terms S
2  F2 and S2  S
2 represent the two components of the basis. The S
2  F2
term is the basis that would exist if the asset being hedged were the same as the asset
underlying the futures contract. The S2  S
2 term is the basis arising from the diﬀerence
between the two assets.
78
CHAPTER 3

Choice of Contract
One key factor aﬀecting basis risk is the choice of the futures contract to be used for
hedging. This choice has two components:
1. The choice of the asset underlying the futures contract
2. The choice of the delivery month.
If the asset being hedged exactly matches an asset underlying a futures contract, the ﬁrst
choice is generally fairly easy. In other circumstances, it is necessary to carry out a
careful analysis to determine which of the available futures contracts has futures prices
that are most closely correlated with the price of the asset being hedged.
The choice of the delivery month is likely to be inﬂuenced by several factors. In the
examples given earlier in this chapter, we assumed that, when the expiration of the
hedge corresponds to a delivery month, the contract with that delivery month is chosen.
In fact, a contract with a later delivery month is usually chosen in these circumstances.
The reason is that futures prices are in some instances quite erratic during the delivery
month. Moreover, a long hedger runs the risk of having to take delivery of the physical
asset if the contract is held during the delivery month. Taking delivery can be expensive
and inconvenient. (Long hedgers normally prefer to close out the futures contract and
buy the asset from their usual suppliers.)
In general, basis risk increases as the time diﬀerence between the hedge expiration
and the delivery month increases. A good rule of thumb is therefore to choose a
delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the expiration of the
hedge. Suppose delivery months are March, June, September, and December for a
futures contract on a particular asset. For hedge expirations in December, January,
and February, the March contract will be chosen; for hedge expirations in March,
April, and May, the June contract will be chosen; and so on. This rule of thumb
assumes that there is suﬃcient liquidity in all contracts to meet the hedger’s
requirements. In practice, liquidity tends to be greatest in short-maturity futures
contracts. Therefore, in some situations, the hedger may be inclined to use short-
maturity contracts and roll them forward. This strategy is discussed later in the
chapter.
Example 3.1
It is March 1. A US company expects to receive 50 million Japanese yen at the end
of July. Yen futures contracts on the CME Group have delivery months of March,
June, September, and December. One contract is for the delivery of 12.5 million
yen. The company therefore shorts four September yen futures contracts on
March 1. When the yen are received at the end of July, the company closes out
its position. We suppose that the futures price on March 1 in cents per yen is
0.9800 and that the spot and futures prices when the contract is closed out are
0.9200 and 0.9250, respectively.
The gain on the futures contract is 0:9800  0:9250 ¼ 0:0550 cents per yen. The
basis is 0:9200  0:9250 ¼ 0:0050 cents per yen when the contract is closed out.
The eﬀective price obtained in cents per yen is the ﬁnal spot price plus the gain on
the futures:
0:9200 þ 0:0550 ¼ 0:9750
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
79

This can also be written as the initial futures price plus the ﬁnal basis:
0:9800 þ ð0:0050Þ ¼ 0:9750
The total amount received by the company for the 50 million yen is 50  0:00975
million dollars, or $487,500.
Example 3.2
It is June 8 and a company knows that it will need to purchase 20,000 barrels of
crude oil at some time in October or November. Oil futures contracts are currently
traded for delivery every month on the NYMEX division of the CME Group and
the contract size is 1,000 barrels. The company therefore decides to use the
December contract for hedging and takes a long position in 20 December con-
tracts. The futures price on June 8 is $88.00 per barrel. The company ﬁnds that it
is ready to purchase the crude oil on November 10. It therefore closes out its
futures contract on that date. The spot price and futures price on November 10
are $90.00 per barrel and $89.10 per barrel.
The gain on the futures contract is 89:10  88:00 ¼ $1:10 per barrel. The basis
when the contract is closed out is 90:00  89:10 ¼ $0:90 per barrel. The eﬀective
price paid (in dollars per barrel) is the ﬁnal spot price less the gain on the
futures, or
90:00  1:10 ¼ 88:90
This can also be calculated as the initial futures price plus the ﬁnal basis,
88:00 þ 0:90 ¼ 88:90
The total price paid is 88:90  20,000 ¼ $1,778,000.
3.4
CROSS HEDGING
In Examples 3.1 and 3.2, the asset underlying the futures contract was the same as the
asset whose price is being hedged. Cross hedging occurs when the two assets are
diﬀerent. Consider, for example, an airline that is concerned about the future price
of jet fuel. Because jet fuel futures are not actively traded, it might choose to use heating
oil futures contracts to hedge its exposure.
The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the
size of the exposure. When the asset underlying the futures contract is the same as the
asset being hedged, it is natural to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. This is the hedge ratio we
have used in the examples considered so far. For instance, in Example 3.2, the hedger’s
exposure was on 20,000 barrels of oil, and futures contracts were entered into for the
delivery of exactly this amount of oil.
When cross hedging is used, setting the hedge ratio equal to 1.0 is not always
optimal. The hedger should choose a value for the hedge ratio that minimizes the
variance of the value of the hedged position. We now consider how the hedger can do
this.
80
CHAPTER 3

Calculating the Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio
The minimum variance hedge ratio depends on the relationship between changes in the
spot price and changes in the futures price. Deﬁne:
S: Change in spot price, S, during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge
F: Change in futures price, F, during a period of time equal to the life of the
hedge.
We will denote the minimum variance hedge ratio by h. It can be shown that h is the
slope of the best-ﬁt line from a linear regression of S against F (see Figure 3.2). This
result is intuitively reasonable. We would expect h to be the ratio of the average change
in S for a particular change in F.
The formula for h is:
h ¼  S
F
ð3:1Þ
where S is the standard deviation of S, F is the standard deviation of F, and  is
the coeﬃcient of correlation between the two.
Equation (3.1) shows that the optimal hedge ratio is the product of the coeﬃcient of
correlation between S and F and the ratio of the standard deviation of S to the
standard deviation of F. Figure 3.3 shows how the variance of the value of the
hedger’s position depends on the hedge ratio chosen.
If  ¼ 1 and F ¼ S, the hedge ratio, h, is 1.0. This result is to be expected, because
in this case the futures price mirrors the spot price perfectly. If  ¼ 1 and F ¼ 2S, the
ΔF
ΔS
Figure 3.2
Regression of change in spot price against change in futures price.
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
81

hedge ratio h is 0.5. This result is also as expected, because in this case the futures price
always changes by twice as much as the spot price. The hedge eﬀectiveness can be
deﬁned as the proportion of the variance that is eliminated by hedging. This is the R2
from the regression of S against F and equals 2.
The parameters , F, and S in equation (3.1) are usually estimated from historical
data on S and F. (The implicit assumption is that the future will in some sense be
like the past.) A number of equal nonoverlapping time intervals are chosen, and the
values of S and F for each of the intervals are observed. Ideally, the length of each
time interval is the same as the length of the time interval for which the hedge is in
eﬀect. In practice, this sometimes severely limits the number of observations that are
available, and a shorter time interval is used.
Optimal Number of Contracts
To calculate the number of contracts that should be used in hedging, deﬁne:
QA:
Size of position being hedged (units)
QF:
Size of one futures contract (units)
N :
Optimal number of futures contracts for hedging.
The futures contracts should be on hQA units of the asset. The number of futures
contracts required is therefore given by
N  ¼ hQA
QF
ð3:2Þ
Example 3.3 shows how the results in this section can be used by an airline hedging the
purchase of jet fuel.3

3 Derivatives with payoﬀs dependent on the price of jet fuel do exist, but heating oil futures are often used to
hedge an exposure to jet fuel prices because they are traded more actively.
82
CHAPTER 3

Example 3.3
An airline expects to purchase 2 million gallons of jet fuel in 1 month and decides
to use heating oil futures for hedging. We suppose that Table 3.2 gives, for
15 successive months, data on the change, S, in the jet fuel price per gallon
and the corresponding change, F, in the futures price for the contract on
heating oil that would be used for hedging price changes during the month. In
this case, the usual formulas for calculating standard deviations and correlations
give F ¼ 0:0313, S ¼ 0:0263, and  ¼ 0:928:
From equation (3.1), the minimum variance hedge ratio, h, is therefore
0:928  0:0263
0:0313 ¼ 0:78
Each heating oil contract traded by the CME Group is on 42,000 gallons of
heating oil. From equation (3.2), the optimal number of contracts is
0:78  2,000,000
42,000
which is 37 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

83

Tailing the Hedge
The analysis we have given so far is correct if we are using forward contracts to hedge.
This is because in that case we are interested in how closely correlated the change in the
forward price is with the change in the spot price over the life of the hedge.
When futures contracts are used for hedging, there is daily settlement and series of
one-day hedges. To reﬂect this, analysts sometimes calculate the correlation between
percentage one-day changes in the futures and spot prices. We will denote this
correlation by ^, and deﬁne ^S and ^F as the standard deviations of percentage one-
day changes in spot and futures prices.
If S and F are the current spot and futures prices, the standard deviations of one-day
price changes are S ^S and F ^F and from equation (3.1) the one-day hedge ratio is
^ S ^S
F ^F
From equation (3.2), the number of contracts needed to hedge over the next day is
N ¼ ^ S ^SQA
F ^FQF
Using this result is sometimes referred to as tailing the hedge.4 We can write the result as
N ¼ ^h VA
VF
ð3:3Þ
where VA is the dollar value of the position being hedged (¼ SQA), VF is the dollar
value of one futures contract (¼ FQF) and ^h is deﬁned similarly to h as
^h ¼ ^ ^S
^F
In theory this result suggests that we should change the futures position every day to
reﬂect the latest values of VA and VF. In practice, day-to-day changes in the hedge are
very small and usually ignored.
3.5
STOCK INDEX FUTURES
We now move on to consider stock index futures and how they are used to hedge or
manage exposures to equity prices.
A stock index tracks changes in the value of a hypothetical portfolio of stocks. The
weight of a stock in the portfolio at a particular time equals the proportion of the
hypothetical portfolio invested in the stock at that time. The percentage increase in the
stock index over a small interval of time is set equal to the percentage increase in the
value of the hypothetical portfolio. Dividends are usually not included in the calcula-
tion so that the index tracks the capital gain/loss from investing in the portfolio.5
4 See Problem 5.23 for a further discussion in the context of currency hedging.
5 An exception to this is a total return index. This is calculated by assuming that dividends on the
hypothetical portfolio are reinvested in the portfolio.
84
CHAPTER 3

If the hypothetical portfolio of stocks remains ﬁxed, the weights assigned to individual
stocks in the portfolio do not remain ﬁxed. When the price of one particular stock in the
portfolio rises more sharply than others, more weight is automatically given to that stock.
Sometimes indices are constructed from a hypothetical portfolio consisting of one of
each of a number of stocks. The weights assigned to the stocks are then proportional to
their market prices, with adjustments being made when there are stock splits. Other
indices are constructed so that weights are proportional to market capitalization (stock
price  number of shares outstanding). The underlying portfolio is then automatically
adjusted to reﬂect stock splits, stock dividends, and new equity issues.
Stock Indices
Table 3.3 shows futures prices for contracts on three diﬀerent stock indices on May 14,
2013.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a portfolio consisting of 30 blue-chip
stocks in the United States. The weights given to the stocks are proportional to their
prices. The CME Group trades two futures contracts on the index. One is on $10 times
the index. The other (the Mini DJ Industrial Average) is on $5 times the index. The
Mini contract trades most actively.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) Index is based on a portfolio of 500 diﬀerent
stocks: 400 industrials, 40 utilities, 20 transportation companies, and 40 ﬁnancial
institutions. The weights of the stocks in the portfolio at any given time are pro-
portional to their market capitalizations. The stocks are those of large publicly held
companies that trade on NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX. The CME Group trades
two futures contracts on the S&P 500. One is on $250 times the index; the other (the
Mini S&P 500 contract) is on $50 times the index. The Mini contract trades most
actively.
The Nasdaq-100 is based on 100 stocks using the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automatic Quotations Service. The CME Group trades two futures contracts.

One is on $100 times the index; the other (the Mini Nasdaq-100 contract) is on $20
times the index. The Mini contract trades most actively.
As mentioned in Chapter 2, futures contracts on stock indices are settled in cash, not
by delivery of the underlying asset. All contracts are marked to market to either the
opening price or the closing price of the index on the last trading day, and the
positions are then deemed to be closed. For example, contracts on the S&P 500 are
closed out at the opening price of the S&P 500 index on the third Friday of the
delivery month.
Hedging an Equity Portfolio
Stock index futures can be used to hedge a well-diversiﬁed equity portfolio. Deﬁne:
VA: Current value of the portfolio
VF : Current value of one futures contract (the futures price times the contract size).
If the portfolio mirrors the index, the optimal hedge ratio can be assumed to be 1.0 and
equation (3.3) shows that the number of futures contracts that should be shorted is
N  ¼ VA
VF

Suppose, for example, that a portfolio worth $5,050,000 mirrors the S&P 500. The
index futures price is 1,010 and each futures contract is on $250 times the index. In this
case VA ¼ 5,050,000 and VF ¼ 1,010  250 ¼ 252,500, so that 20 contracts should be
shorted to hedge the portfolio.
When the portfolio does not mirror the index, we can use the capital asset pricing
model (see the appendix to this chapter). The parameter beta () from the capital
asset pricing model is the slope of the best-ﬁt line obtained when excess return on the
portfolio over the risk-free rate is regressed against the excess return of the index over
the risk-free rate. When  ¼ 1:0, the return on the portfolio tends to mirror the return
on the index; when  ¼ 2:0, the excess return on the portfolio tends to be twice as
great as the excess return on the index; when  ¼ 0:5, it tends to be half as great; and
so on.
A portfolio with a  of 2.0 is twice as sensitive to movements in the index as a
portfolio with a beta 1.0. It is therefore necessary to use twice as many contracts to
hedge the portfolio. Similarly, a portfolio with a beta of 0.5 is half as sensitive to
market movements as a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 and we should use half as many
contracts to hedge it. In general,
N  ¼  VA
VF
ð3:5Þ
This formula assumes that the maturity of the futures contract is close to the maturity
of the hedge.
Comparing equation (3.5) with equation (3.3), we see that they imply ^h ¼ . This is
not surprising. The hedge ratio ^h is the slope of the best-ﬁt line when percentage one-
day changes in the portfolio are regressed against percentage one-day changes in the
futures price of the index. Beta () is the slope of the best-ﬁt line when the return from
the portfolio is regressed against the return for the index.

CHAPTER 3

We illustrate that this formula gives good results by extending our earlier example.
Suppose that a futures contract with 4 months to maturity is used to hedge the value of
a portfolio over the next 3 months in the following situation:
Value of S&P 500 index ¼ 1,000
S&P 500 futures price ¼ 1,010
Value of portfolio ¼ $5,050,000
Risk-free interest rate ¼ 4% per annum
Dividend yield on index ¼ 1% per annum
Beta of portfolio ¼ 1:5
One futures contract is for delivery of $250 times the index. As before, VF ¼
250  1,010 ¼ 252,500. From equation (3.5), the number of futures contracts that should
be shorted to hedge the portfolio is
1:5  5,050,000
252,500 ¼ 30
Suppose the index turns out to be 900 in 3 months and the futures price is 902. The gain
from the short futures position is then
30  ð1010  902Þ  250 ¼ $810,000
The loss on the index is 10%. The index pays a dividend of 1% per annum, or 0.25%
per 3 months. When dividends are taken into account, an investor in the index would
therefore earn 9.75% over the 3-month period. Because the portfolio has a  of 1.5,
the capital asset pricing model gives
Expected return on portfolio  Risk-free interest rate
¼ 1:5  ðReturn on index  Risk-free interest rateÞ
The risk-free interest rate is approximately 1% per 3 months. It follows that the expected
return (%) on the portfolio during the 3 months when the 3-month return on the index

is 9.75% is
1:0 þ ½1:5  ð9:75  1:0Þ ¼ 15:125
The expected value of the portfolio (inclusive of dividends) at the end of the 3 months is
therefore
$5,050,000  ð1  0:15125Þ ¼ $4,286,187
It follows that the expected value of the hedger’s position, including the gain on the
hedge, is
$4,286,187 þ $810,000 ¼ $5,096,187
Table 3.4 summarizes these calculations together with similar calculations for other
values of the index at maturity. It can be seen that the total expected value of the
hedger’s position in 3 months is almost independent of the value of the index.
The only thing we have not covered in this example is the relationship between futures
prices and spot prices. We will see in Chapter 5 that the 1,010 assumed for the futures
price today is roughly what we would expect given the interest rate and dividend we are
assuming. The same is true of the futures prices in 3 months shown in Table 3.4.6
Reasons for Hedging an Equity Portfolio
Table 3.4 shows that the hedging procedure results in a value for the hedger’s position
at the end of the 3-month period being about 1% higher than at the beginning of the
3-month period. There is no surprise here. The risk-free rate is 4% per annum, or 1%
per 3 months. The hedge results in the investor’s position growing at the risk-free rate.
It is natural to ask why the hedger should go to the trouble of using futures contracts.
To earn the risk-free interest rate, the hedger can simply sell the portfolio and invest the
proceeds in a risk-free instrument.
One answer to this question is that hedging can be justiﬁed if the hedger feels that
the stocks in the portfolio have been chosen well. In these circumstances, the hedger
might be very uncertain about the performance of the market as a whole, but
conﬁdent that the stocks in the portfolio will outperform the market (after appropriate
adjustments have been made for the beta of the portfolio). A hedge using index futures
removes the risk arising from market moves and leaves the hedger exposed only to the
performance of the portfolio relative to the market. This will be discussed further
shortly. Another reason for hedging may be that the hedger is planning to hold a
portfolio for a long period of time and requires short-term protection in an uncertain
market situation. The alternative strategy of selling the portfolio and buying it back
later might involve unacceptably high transaction costs.
Changing the Beta of a Portfolio
In the example in Table 3.4, the beta of the hedger’s portfolio is reduced to zero so that
the hedger’s expected return is almost independent of the performance of the index.
6 The calculations in Table 3.4 assume that the dividend yield on the index is predictable, the risk-free interest
rate remains constant, and the return on the index over the 3-month period is perfectly correlated with the
return on the portfolio. In practice, these assumptions do not hold perfectly, and the hedge works rather less
well than is indicated by Table 3.4.
88
CHAPTER 3

Sometimes futures contracts are used to change the beta of a portfolio to some value
other than zero. Continuing with our earlier example:
S&P 500 index ¼ 1,000
S&P 500 futures price ¼ 1,010
Value of portfolio ¼ $5,050,000
Beta of portfolio ¼ 1:5
As before, VF ¼ 250  1,010 ¼ 252,500 and a complete hedge requires
1:5  5,050,000
252,500 ¼ 30
contracts to be shorted. To reduce the beta of the portfolio from 1.5 to 0.75, the
number of contracts shorted should be 15 rather than 30; to increase the beta of the
portfolio to 2.0, a long position in 10 contracts should be taken; and so on. In general,
to change the beta of the portfolio from  to , where  > , a short position in
ð  Þ VA
VF
contracts is required. When  < , a long position in
ð  Þ VA
VF
contracts is required.
Locking in the Beneﬁts of Stock Picking
Suppose you consider yourself to be good at picking stocks that will outperform the
market. You own a single stock or a small portfolio of stocks. You do not know how
well the market will perform over the next few months, but you are conﬁdent that your
portfolio will do better than the market. What should you do?
You should short VA=VF index futures contracts, where  is the beta of your
portfolio, VA is the total value of the portfolio, and VF is the current value of one
index futures contract. If your portfolio performs better than a well-diversiﬁed portfolio
with the same beta, you will then make money.
Consider an investor who in April holds 20,000 shares of a company, each worth $100.
The investor feels that the market will be very volatile over the next three months but that
the company has a good chance of outperforming the market. The investor decides to use
the August futures contract on the S&P 500 to hedge the market’s return during the three-
month period. The  of the company’s stock is estimated at 1.1. Suppose that the current
futures price for the August contract on the S&P 500 is 1,500. Each contract is for delivery
of
$250
times
the
index.
In
this
case,
VA ¼ 20,000  100 ¼ 2,000,000
and
VF ¼ 1;500  250 ¼ 375,000. The number of contracts that should be shorted is therefore
1:1  2,000,000
375,000 ¼ 5:87
Rounding to the nearest integer, the investor shorts 6 contracts, closing out the
position in July. Suppose the company’s stock price falls to $90 and the futures price
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
89

of the S&P 500 falls to 1,300. The investor loses 20,000  ð$100  $90Þ ¼ $200,000 on
the stock, while gaining 6  250  ð1,500  1,300Þ ¼ $300,000 on the futures contracts.
The overall gain to the investor in this case is $100,000 because the company’s stock
price did not go down by as much as a well-diversiﬁed portfolio with a  of 1.1. If the
market had gone up and the company’s stock price went up by more than a portfolio
with a  of 1.1 (as expected by the investor), then a proﬁt would be made in this case
as well.
3.6
STACK AND ROLL
Sometimes the expiration date of the hedge is later than the delivery dates of all the
futures contracts that can be used. The hedger must then roll the hedge forward by
closing out one futures contract and taking the same position in a futures contract with
a later delivery date. Hedges can be rolled forward many times. The procedure is known
as stack and roll. Consider a company that wishes to use a short hedge to reduce the risk
associated with the price to be received for an asset at time T. If there are futures
contracts 1, 2, 3, . . . , n (not all necessarily in existence at the present time) with
progressively later delivery dates, the company can use the following strategy:
Time t1: Short futures contract 1
Time t2: Close out futures contract 1
Short futures contract 2
Time t3: Close out futures contract 2
Short futures contract 3
..
.
Time tn: Close out futures contract n  1
Short futures contract n
Time T: Close out futures contract n.
Suppose that in April 2014 a company realizes that it will have 100,000 barrels of oil
to sell in June 2015 and decides to hedge its risk with a hedge ratio of 1.0. (In this
example, we do not make the ‘‘tailing’’ adjustment described in Section 3.4.) The current
spot price is $89. Although futures contracts are traded with maturities stretching several
years into the future, we suppose that only the ﬁrst six delivery months have suﬃcient
liquidity to meet the company’s needs. The company therefore shorts 100 October 2014
contracts. In September 2014, it rolls the hedge forward into the March 2015 contract.
In February 2015, it rolls the hedge forward again into the July 2015 contract.

CHAPTER 3

One possible outcome is shown in Table 3.5. The October 2014 contract is shorted
at $88.20 per barrel and closed out at $87.40 per barrel for a proﬁt of $0.80 per barrel;
the March 2015 contract is shorted at $87.00 per barrel and closed out at $86.50 per
barrel for a proﬁt of $0.50 per barrel. The July 2015 contract is shorted at $86.30 per
barrel and closed out at $85.90 per barrel for a proﬁt of $0.40 per barrel. The ﬁnal
spot price is $86.
The dollar gain per barrel of oil from the short futures contracts is
ð88:20  87:40Þ þ ð87:00  86:50Þ þ ð86:30  85:90Þ ¼ 1:70
The oil price declined from $89 to $86. Receiving only $1.70 per barrel compensation
for a price decline of $3.00 may appear unsatisfactory. However, we cannot expect total
compensation for a price decline when futures prices are below spot prices. The best we
can hope for is to lock in the futures price that would apply to a June 2015 contract if it
were actively traded.
In practice, a company usually has an exposure every month to the underlying asset
and uses a 1-month futures contract for hedging because it is the most liquid. Initially it
enters into (‘‘stacks’’) suﬃcient contracts to cover its exposure to the end of its hedging
horizon. One month later, it closes out all the contracts and ‘‘rolls’’ them into new
1-month contracts to cover its new exposure, and so on.
As described in Business Snapshot 3.2, a German company, Metallgesellschaft,
followed this strategy in the early 1990s to hedge contracts it had entered into to supply
commodities at a ﬁxed price. It ran into diﬃculties because the prices of the commod-
ities declined so that there were immediate cash outﬂows on the futures and the
expectation of eventual gains on the contracts. This mismatch between the timing of
the cash ﬂows on hedge and the timing of the cash ﬂows from the position being hedged
led to liquidity problems that could not be handled. The moral of the story is that
potential liquidity problems should always be considered when a hedging strategy is
being planned.
Business Snapshot 3.2
Metallgesellschaft: Hedging Gone Awry
Sometimes rolling hedges forward can lead to cash ﬂow pressures. The problem was
illustrated dramatically by the activities of a German company, Metallgesellschaft
(MG), in the early 1990s.
MG sold a huge volume of 5- to 10-year heating oil and gasoline ﬁxed-price
supply contracts to its customers at 6 to 8 cents above market prices. It hedged its
exposure with long positions in short-dated futures contracts that were rolled
forward. As it turned out, the price of oil fell and there were margin calls on the
futures positions. Considerable short-term cash ﬂow pressures were placed on MG.
The members of MG who devised the hedging strategy argued that these short-term
cash outﬂows were oﬀset by positive cash ﬂows that would ultimately be realized on
the long-term ﬁxed-price contracts. However, the company’s senior management
and its bankers became concerned about the huge cash drain. As a result, the
company closed out all the hedge positions and agreed with its customers that the
ﬁxed-price contracts would be abandoned. The outcome was a loss to MG of
$1.33 billion.
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
91

SUMMARY
This chapter has discussed various ways in which a company can take a position in
futures contracts to oﬀset an exposure to the price of an asset. If the exposure is such
that the company gains when the price of the asset increases and loses when the price of
the asset decreases, a short hedge is appropriate. If the exposure is the other way round
(i.e., the company gains when the price of the asset decreases and loses when the price
of the asset increases), a long hedge is appropriate.
Hedging is a way of reducing risk. As such, it should be welcomed by most
executives. In reality, there are a number of theoretical and practical reasons why
companies do not hedge. On a theoretical level, we can argue that shareholders, by
holding well-diversiﬁed portfolios, can eliminate many of the risks faced by a company.
They do not require the company to hedge these risks. On a practical level, a company
may ﬁnd that it is increasing rather than decreasing risk by hedging if none of its
competitors does so. Also, a treasurer may fear criticism from other executives if the
company makes a gain from movements in the price of the underlying asset and a loss
on the hedge.
An important concept in hedging is basis risk. The basis is the diﬀerence between the
spot price of an asset and its futures price. Basis risk arises from uncertainty as to what
the basis will be at maturity of the hedge.
The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the
size of the exposure. It is not always optimal to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. If the hedger
wishes to minimize the variance of a position, a hedge ratio diﬀerent from 1.0 may be
appropriate. The optimal hedge ratio is the slope of the best-ﬁt line obtained when
changes in the spot price are regressed against changes in the futures price.
Stock index futures can be used to hedge the systematic risk in an equity portfolio.
The number of futures contracts required is the beta of the portfolio multiplied by the
ratio of the value of the portfolio to the value of one futures contract. Stock index
futures can also be used to change the beta of a portfolio without changing the stocks
that make up the portfolio.
When there is no liquid futures contract that matures later than the expiration of the
hedge, a strategy known as stack and roll may be appropriate. This involves entering
into a sequence of futures contracts. When the ﬁrst futures contract is near expiration, it
is closed out and the hedger enters into a second contract with a later delivery month.
When the second contract is close to expiration, it is closed out and the hedger enters
into a third contract with a later delivery month; and so on. The result of all this is the
creation of a long-dated futures contract by trading a series of short-dated contracts.

units. The spot price of the asset that is owned is $28 and the standard deviation of the
change in this price over the life of the hedge is estimated to be $0.43. The futures price of
the related asset is $27 and the standard deviation of the change in this over the life of the
hedge is $0.40. The coeﬃcient of correlation between the spot price change and futures
price change is 0.95.
(a) What is the minimum variance hedge ratio?
(b) Should the hedger take a long or short futures position?
(c) What is the optimal number of futures contracts with no tailing of the hedge?
(d) What is the optimal number of futures contracts with tailing of the hedge?
3.27. A company wishes to hedge its exposure to a new fuel whose price changes have a 0.6
correlation with gasoline futures price changes. The company will lose $1 million for each
1 cent increase in the price per gallon of the new fuel over the next three months. The new
fuel’s price changes have a standard deviation that is 50% greater than price changes in
gasoline futures prices. If gasoline futures are used to hedge the exposure, what should the
hedge ratio be? What is the company’s exposure measured in gallons of the new fuel?
What position, measured in gallons, should the company take in gasoline futures? How
many gasoline futures contracts should be traded? Each contract is on 42,000 gallons.
3.28. A portfolio manager has maintained an actively managed portfolio with a beta of 0.2.
During the last year, the risk-free rate was 5% and equities performed very badly
providing a return of 30%. The portfolio manager produced a return of 10% and
claims that in the circumstances it was a good performance. Discuss this claim.

3.30. It is July 16. A company has a portfolio of stocks worth $100 million. The beta of the
portfolio is 1.2. The company would like to use the December futures contract on a stock
index to change the beta of the portfolio to 0.5 during the period July 16 to November 16.
The index futures price is currently 1,000 and each contract is on $250 times the index.

3.31. A fund manager has a portfolio worth $50 million with a beta of 0.87. The manager is
concerned about the performance of the market over the next 2 months and plans to use
3-month futures contracts on the S&P 500 to hedge the risk. The current level of the index is
1,250, one contract is on 250 times the index, the risk-free rate is 6% per annum, and the
dividend yield on the index is 3% per annum. The current 3-month futures price is 1,259.
(a) What position should the fund manager take to hedge all exposure to the market over

(b) Calculate the eﬀect of your strategy on the fund manager’s returns if the index in
2 months is 1,000, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300, and 1,400. Assume that the 1-month futures price

3.32. It is now October 2014. A company anticipates that it will purchase 1 million pounds of
copper in each of February 2015, August 2015, February 2016, and August 2016. The
company has decided to use the futures contracts traded in the COMEX division of the
CME Group to hedge its risk. One contract is for the delivery of 25,000 pounds of copper.
The initial margin is $2,000 per contract and the maintenance margin is $1,500 per
contract. The company’s policy is to hedge 80% of its exposure. Contracts with maturities
up to 13 months into the future are considered to have suﬃcient liquidity to meet the
company’s needs. Devise a hedging strategy for the company. (Do not make the ‘‘tailing’’
adjustment described in Section 3.4.)
Assume the market prices (in cents per pound) today and at future dates are as in the
following table. What is the impact of the strategy you propose on the price the company
pays for copper? What is the initial margin requirement in October 2014? Is the company
subject to any margin calls?

CHAPTER 3

APPENDIX
CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that can be used to relate the
expected return from an asset to the risk of the return. The risk in the return from an
asset is divided into two parts. Systematic risk is risk related to the return from the
market as a whole and cannot be diversiﬁed away. Nonsystematic risk is risk that is
unique to the asset and can be diversiﬁed away by choosing a large portfolio of diﬀerent
assets. CAPM argues that the return should depend only on systematic risk. The CAPM
formula is7
Expected return on asset ¼ RF þ ðRM  RFÞ
ð3A:1Þ
where RM is the return on the portfolio of all available investments, RF is the return on
a risk-free investment, and  (the Greek letter beta) is a parameter measuring
systematic risk.
The return from the portfolio of all available investments, RM, is referred to as the
return on the market and is usually approximated as the return on a well-diversiﬁed
stock index such as the S&P 500. The beta () of an asset is a measure of the sensitivity
of its returns to returns from the market. It can be estimated from historical data as the
slope obtained when the excess return on the asset over the risk-free rate is regressed
against the excess return on the market over the risk-free rate. When  ¼ 0, an asset’s
returns are not sensitive to returns from the market. In this case, it has no systematic
risk and equation (3A.1) shows that its expected return is the risk-free rate; when
 ¼ 0:5, the excess return on the asset over the risk-free rate is on average half of the
excess return of the market over the risk-free rate; when  ¼ 1, the expected return on
the asset equals to the return on the market; and so on.
Suppose that the risk-free rate RF is 5% and the return on the market is 13%.
Equation (3A.1) shows that, when the beta of an asset is zero, its expected return is 5%.
When  ¼ 0:75, its expected return is 0:05 þ 0:75  ð0:13  0:05Þ ¼ 0:11, or 11%.
The derivation of CAPM requires a number of assumptions.8 In particular:
1. Investors care only about the expected return and standard deviation of the return
from an asset.
2. The returns from two assets are correlated with each other only because of their
correlation with the return from the market. This is equivalent to assuming that
there is only one factor driving returns.
3. Investors focus on returns over a single period and that period is the the same for
all investors.
4. Investors can borrow and lend at the same risk-free rate.
5. Tax does not inﬂuence investment decisions.
6. All investors make the same estimates of expected returns, standard deviations of
returns, and correlations betweeen returns.
7 If the return on the market is not known, RM is replaced by the expected value of RM in this formula.
8 For details on the derivation, see, for example, J. Hull, Risk Management and Financial Institutions, 3rd
edn. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2012, Chap. 1.
Hedging Strategies Using Futures
97

These assumptions are at best only approximately true. Nevertheless CAPM has proved
to be a useful tool for portfolio managers and is often used as a benchmark for
assessing their performance.
When the asset is an individual stock, the expected return given by equation (3A.1) is
not a particularly good predictor of the actual return. But, when the asset is a well-
diversiﬁed portfolio of stocks, it is a much better predictor. As a result, the equation
Return on diversified portfolio ¼ RF þ ðRM  RFÞ
can be used as a basis for hedging a diversiﬁed portfolio, as described in Section 3.5.
The  in the equation is the beta of the portfolio. It can be calculated as the weighted
average of the betas of the stocks in the portfolio.

CHAPTER 3

Interest Rates
Interest rates are a factor in the valuation of virtually all derivatives and will feature
prominently in much of the material that will be presented in the rest of this book. This
chapter deals with some fundamental issues concerned with the way interest rates are
measured and analyzed. It explains the compounding frequency used to deﬁne an
interest rate and the meaning of continuously compounded interest rates, which are
used extensively in the analysis of derivatives. It covers zero rates, par yields, and yield
curves, discusses bond pricing, and outlines a ‘‘bootstrap’’ procedure commonly used by
a derivatives trading desk to calculate zero-coupon Treasury interest rates. It also covers
forward rates and forward rate agreements and reviews diﬀerent theories of the term
structure of interest rates. Finally, it explains the use of duration and convexity measures
to determine the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rate changes.
Chapter 6 will cover interest rate futures and show how the duration measure can be
used when interest rate exposures are hedged. For ease of exposition, day count
conventions will be ignored throughout this chapter. The nature of these conventions
and their impact on calculations will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.
4.1
TYPES OF RATES
An interest rate in a particular situation deﬁnes the amount of money a borrower
promises to pay the lender. For any given currency, many diﬀerent types of interest rates
are regularly quoted. These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing
rates, and so on. The interest rate applicable in a situation depends on the credit risk.
This is the risk that there will be a default by the borrower of funds, so that the interest
and principal are not paid to the lender as promised. The higher the credit risk, the
higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower.
Interest rates are often expressed in basis points. One basis point is 0.01% per annum.
Treasury Rates
Treasury rates are the rates an investor earns on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds.
These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency.
Japanese Treasury rates are the rates at which the Japanese government borrows in
99
4
C H A P T E R

yen; US Treasury rates are the rates at which the US government borrows in US dollars;
and so on. It is usually assumed that there is no chance that a government will default
on an obligation denominated in its own currency. Treasury rates are therefore totally
risk-free rates in the sense that an investor who buys a Treasury bill or Treasury bond is
certain that interest and principal payments will be made as promised.
LIBOR
LIBOR is short for London Interbank Oﬀered Rate. It is an unsecured short-term
borrowing rate between banks. LIBOR rates have traditionally been calculated each
business day for 10 currencies and 15 borrowing periods. The borrowing periods range
from one day to one year. LIBOR rates are used as reference rates for hundreds of
trillions of dollars of transactions throughout the world. One popular derivatives
transaction that uses LIBOR as a reference interest rate is an interest rate swap (see
Chapter 7). LIBOR rates are published by the British Bankers Association (BBA) at
11:30 a.m. (UK time). The BBA asks a number of diﬀerent banks to provide quotes
estimating the rate of interest at which they could borrow funds just prior to 11:00 a.m.
(UK time). The top quarter and bottom quarter of the quotes for each currency/
borrowing-period combination are discarded and the remaining ones are averaged to
determine the LIBOR ﬁxings for a day. Typically the banks submitting quotes have a
AA credit rating.1 LIBOR is therefore usually considered to be an estimate of the short-
term unsecured borrowing rate for a AA-rated ﬁnancial institution.
In recent years there have been suggestions that some banks may have manipulated
their LIBOR quotes. Two reasons have been suggested for manipulation. One is to
make the banks’ borrowing costs seem lower than they actually are, so that they appear
healthier. Another is to proﬁt from transactions such as interest rate swaps whose cash
ﬂows depend on LIBOR ﬁxings. The underlying problem is that there is not enough
interbank borrowing for banks to make accurate estimates of their borrowing rates for
all the diﬀerent currency/borrowing-period combinations that are used. It seems likely
that over time the large number of LIBOR quotes that have been provided each day will
be replaced by a smaller number of quotes based on actual transactions in a more liquid
market.
The Fed Funds Rate
In the United States, ﬁnancial institutions are required to maintain a certain amount of
cash (known as reserves) with the Federal Reserve. The reserve requirement for a bank
at any time depends on its outstanding assets and liabilities. At the end of a day, some
ﬁnancial institutions typically have surplus funds in their accounts with the Federal
Reserve while others have requirements for funds. This leads to borrowing and lending
overnight. In the United States, the overnight rate is called the federal funds rate. A
broker usually matches borrowers and lenders. The weighted average of the rates in
brokered transactions (with weights being determined by the size of the transaction) is
termed the eﬀective federal funds rate. This overnight rate is monitored by the central
bank, which may intervene with its own transactions in an attempt to raise or lower it.
Other countries have similar systems to the US. For example, in the UK the average of
1 The best credit rating category is AAA. The second best is AA.
100
CHAPTER 4

brokered overnight rates is termed the sterling overnight index average (SONIA) and, in
the euro zone, it is termed the euro overnight index average (EONIA).
Both LIBOR and the federal funds rate are unsecured borrowing rates. On average,
overnight LIBOR has been about 6 basis points (0.06%) higher than the eﬀective
federal funds rate except for the tumultuous period from August 2007 to December
2008. The observed diﬀerences between the rates can be attributed to timing eﬀects, the
composition of the pool of borrowers in London as compared to New York, and
diﬀerences between the settlement mechanisms in London and New York.2
Repo Rates
Unlike LIBOR and federal funds rates, repo rates are secured borrowing rates. In a repo
(or repurchase agreement), a ﬁnancial institution that owns securities agrees to sell the
securities for a certain price and buy them back at a later time for a slightly higher
price. The ﬁnancial institution is obtaining a loan and the interest it pays is the
diﬀerence between the price at which the securities are sold and the price at which
they are repurchased. The interest rate is referred to as the repo rate.
If structured carefully, a repo involves very little credit risk. If the borrower does not
honor the agreement, the lending company simply keeps the securities. If the lending
company does not keep to its side of the agreement, the original owner of the securities
keeps the cash provided by the lending company. The most common type of repo is an
overnight repo which may be rolled over day to day. However, longer term arrange-
ments, known as term repos, are sometimes used. Because they are secured rates, a repo
rate is generally slightly below the corresponding fed funds rate.
The ‘‘Risk-Free’’ Rate
Derivatives are usually valued by setting up a riskless portfolio and arguing that the
return on the portfolio should be the risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate
therefore plays a key role in the valuation of derivatives. For most of this book we will
refer to the ‘‘risk-free’’ rate without explicitly deﬁning which rate we are referring to.
This is because derivatives practitioners use a number of diﬀerent proxies for the risk-
free rate. Traditionally LIBOR has been used as the risk-free rate—even though LIBOR
is not risk-free because there is some small chance that a AA-rated ﬁnancial institution
will default on a short-term loan. However, this is changing. In Chapter 9, we will
discuss the issues that practitioners currently consider when they choose the ‘‘risk-free’’
rate and some of the theoretical arguments that can be advanced.
4.2
MEASURING INTEREST RATES
A statement by a bank that the interest rate on one-year deposits is 10% per annum
sounds straightforward and unambiguous. In fact, its precise meaning depends on the
way the interest rate is measured.
2 See L. Bartolini, S. Hilton, and A. Prati, ‘‘Money Market Integration,’’ Journal of Money, Credit and
Banking, 40, 1 (February 2008), 193–213.
Interest Rates
101

If the interest rate is measured with annual compounding, the bank’s statement that
the interest rate is 10% means that $100 grows to
$100  1:1 ¼ $110
at the end of 1 year. When the interest rate is measured with semiannual compounding,
it means that 5% is earned every 6 months, with the interest being reinvested. In this
case, $100 grows to
$100  1:05  1:05 ¼ $110:25
at the end of 1 year. When the interest rate is measured with quarterly compounding,
the bank’s statement means that 2.5% is earned every 3 months, with the interest being
reinvested. The $100 then grows to
$100  1:0254 ¼ $110:38
at the end of 1 year. Table 4.1 shows the eﬀect of increasing the compounding frequency
further.
The compounding frequency deﬁnes the units in which an interest rate is measured. A
rate expressed with one compounding frequency can be converted into an equivalent
rate with a diﬀerent compounding frequency. For example, from Table 4.1 we see that
10.25% with annual compounding is equivalent to 10% with semiannual compound-
ing. We can think of the diﬀerence between one compounding frequency and another to
be analogous to the diﬀerence between kilometers and miles. They are two diﬀerent
units of measurement.
To generalize our results, suppose that an amount A is invested for n years at an
interest rate of R per annum. If the rate is compounded once per annum, the terminal
value of the investment is
Að1 þ RÞn
If the rate is compounded m times per annum, the terminal value of the investment is

When m ¼ 1, the rate is sometimes referred to as the equivalent annual interest rate.

CHAPTER 4

Continuous Compounding
The limit as the compounding frequency, m, tends to inﬁnity is known as continuous
compounding.3 With continuous compounding, it can be shown that an amount A
invested for n years at rate R grows to
AeRn
ð4:2Þ
where e is approximately 2.71828. The exponential function, ex, is built into most
calculators, so the computation of the expression in equation (4.2) presents no problems.
In the example in Table 4.1, A ¼ 100, n ¼ 1, and R ¼ 0:1, so that the value to which A
grows with continuous compounding is
100e0:1 ¼ $110:52
This is (to two decimal places) the same as the value with daily compounding. For most
practical purposes, continuous compounding can be thought of as being equivalent to
daily compounding. Compounding a sum of money at a continuously compounded rate
R for n years involves multiplying it by eRn. Discounting it at a continuously com-
pounded rate R for n years involves multiplying by eRn.
In this book, interest rates will be measured with continuous compounding except
where stated otherwise. Readers used to working with interest rates that are measured
with annual, semiannual, or some other compounding frequency may ﬁnd this a little
strange at ﬁrst. However, continuously compounded interest rates are used to such a great
extent in pricing derivatives that it makes sense to get used to working with them now.
Suppose that Rc is a rate of interest with continuous compounding and Rm is the
equivalent rate with compounding m times per annum. From the results in equa-
tions (4.1) and (4.2), we have
AeRcn ¼ A


This means that
Rc ¼ m ln

ð4:3Þ
and
Rm ¼ mðeRc=m  1Þ
ð4:4Þ
These equations can be used to convert a rate with a compounding frequency of m times
per annum to a continuously compounded rate and vice versa. The natural logarithm
function ln x, which is built into most calculators, is the inverse of the exponential
function, so that, if y ¼ ln x, then x ¼ ey.
Example 4.1
Consider an interest rate that is quoted as 10% per annum with semiannual
compounding. From equation (4.3) with m ¼ 2 and Rm ¼ 0:1, the equivalent rate
3 Actuaries sometimes refer to a continuously compounded rate as the force of interest.

with continuous compounding is

¼ 0:09758
or 9.758% per annum.
Example 4.2
Suppose that a lender quotes the interest rate on loans as 8% per annum with
continuous compounding, and that interest is actually paid quarterly. From
equation (4.4) with m ¼ 4 and Rc ¼ 0:08, the equivalent rate with quarterly
compounding is
4  ðe0:08=4  1Þ ¼ 0:0808
or 8.08% per annum. This means that on a $1,000 loan, interest payments of
$20.20 would be required each quarter.
4.3
ZERO RATES
The n-year zero-coupon interest rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that
starts today and lasts for n years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of
n years. There are no intermediate payments. The n-year zero-coupon interest rate is
sometimes also referred to as the n-year spot rate, the n-year zero rate, or just the n-year
zero. Suppose a 5-year zero rate with continuous compounding is quoted as 5% per
annum. This means that $100, if invested for 5 years, grows to
100  e0:055 ¼ 128:40
Most of the interest rates we observe directly in the market are not pure zero rates.
Consider a 5-year government bond that provides a 6% coupon. The price of this bond
does not by itself determine the 5-year Treasury zero rate because some of the return on
the bond is realized in the form of coupons prior to the end of year 5. Later in this
chapter we will discuss how we can determine Treasury zero rates from the market
prices of coupon-bearing bonds.
4.4
BOND PRICING
Most bonds pay coupons to the holder periodically. The bond’s principal (which is also
known as its par value or face value) is paid at the end of its life. The theoretical price
of a bond can be calculated as the present value of all the cash ﬂows that will be
received by the owner of the bond. Sometimes bond traders use the same discount rate
for all the cash ﬂows underlying a bond, but a more accurate approach is to use a
diﬀerent zero rate for each cash ﬂow.
To illustrate this, consider the situation where Treasury zero rates, measured with
continuous compounding, are as in Table 4.2. (We explain later how these can be
calculated.) Suppose that a 2-year Treasury bond with a principal of $100 provides
coupons at the rate of 6% per annum semiannually. To calculate the present value of
the ﬁrst coupon of $3, we discount it at 5.0% for 6 months; to calculate the present
104
CHAPTER 4

value of the second coupon of $3, we discount it at 5.8% for 1 year; and so on.
Therefore, the theoretical price of the bond is
3e0:050:5 þ 3e0:0581:0 þ 3e0:0641:5 þ 103e0:0682:0 ¼ 98:39
or $98.39.
Bond Yield
A bond’s yield is the single discount rate that, when applied to all cash ﬂows, gives a
bond price equal to its market price. Suppose that the theoretical price of the bond we
have been considering, $98.39, is also its market value (i.e., the market’s price of the
bond is in exact agreement with the data in Table 4.2). If y is the yield on the bond,
expressed with continuous compounding, it must be true that
3ey0:5 þ 3ey1:0 þ 3ey1:5 þ 103ey2:0 ¼ 98:39
This equation can be solved using an iterative (‘‘trial and error’’) procedure to give
y ¼ 6:76%.4
Par Yield
The par yield for a certain bond maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond price to
equal its par value. (The par value is the same as the principal value.) Usually the bond is
assumed to provide semiannual coupons. Suppose that the coupon on a 2-year bond in
our example is c per annum (or 1
2c per 6 months). Using the zero rates in Table 4.2, the
value of the bond is equal to its par value of 100 when
c
2 e0:050:5 þ c

2 e0:0641:5 þ

100 þ c
2

e0:0682:0 ¼ 100
This equation can be solved in a straightforward way to give c ¼ 6:87. The 2-year par
yield is therefore 6.87% per annum. This has semiannual compounding because
payments are assumed to be made every 6 months. With continuous compounding,
the rate is 6.75% per annum.
More generally, if d is the present value of $1 received at the maturity of the bond,
A is the value of an annuity that pays one dollar on each coupon payment date, and m

The formula conﬁrms that the par yield is 6.87% per annum.
4.5
DETERMINING TREASURY ZERO RATES
One way of determining Treasury zero rates such as those in Table 4.2 is to observe the
yields on ‘‘strips.’’ These are zero-coupon bonds that are synthetically created by traders
when they sell coupons on a Treasury bond separately from the principal.
Another way to determine Treasury zero rates is from Treasury bills and coupon-
bearing bonds. The most popular approach is known as the bootstrap method. To
illustrate the nature of the method, consider the data in Table 4.3 on the prices of ﬁve
bonds. Because the ﬁrst three bonds pay no coupons, the zero rates corresponding to
the maturities of these bonds can easily be calculated. The 3-month bond has the eﬀect
of turning an investment of 97.5 into 100 in 3 months. The continuously compounded
3-month rate R is therefore given by solving
100 ¼ 97:5eR0:25
It is 10.127% per annum. The 6-month continuously compounded rate is similarly
given by solving
100 ¼ 94:9eR0:5
It is 10.469% per annum. Similarly, the 1-year rate with continuous compounding is
given by solving
100 ¼ 90eR1:0
It is 10.536% per annum.

CHAPTER 4

The fourth bond lasts 1.5 years. The payments are as follows:
6 months: $4
1 year:
$4
1.5 years:
$104.
From our earlier calculations, we know that the discount rate for the payment at the end
of 6 months is 10.469% and that the discount rate for the payment at the end of 1 year is
10.536%. We also know that the bond’s price, $96, must equal the present value of all the
payments received by the bondholder. Suppose the 1.5-year zero rate is denoted by R. It
follows that
4e0:104690:5 þ 4e0:105361:0 þ 104eR1:5 ¼ 96
This reduces to
e1:5R ¼ 0:85196
or
R ¼  lnð0:85196Þ
1:5
¼ 0:10681
The 1.5-year zero rate is therefore 10.681%. This is the only zero rate that is consistent
with the 6-month rate, 1-year rate, and the data in Table 4.3.
The 2-year zero rate can be calculated similarly from the 6-month, 1-year, and
1.5-year zero rates, and the information on the last bond in Table 4.3. If R is the
2-year zero rate, then
6e0:104690:5 þ 6e0:105361:0 þ 6e0:106811:5 þ 106eR2:0 ¼ 101:6
This gives R ¼ 0:10808, or 10.808%.
The rates we have calculated are summarized in Table 4.4. A chart showing the zero
rate as a function of maturity is known as the zero curve. A common assumption is that
the zero curve is linear between the points determined using the bootstrap method.
(This means that the 1.25-year zero rate is 0:5  10:536 þ 0:5  10:681 ¼ 10:6085% in
our example.) It is also usually assumed that the zero curve is horizontal prior to the
ﬁrst point and horizontal beyond the last point. Figure 4.1 shows the zero curve for our
data using these assumptions. By using longer maturity bonds, the zero curve would be
more accurately determined beyond 2 years.
In practice, we do not usually have bonds with maturities equal to exactly 1.5 years,
2 years, 2.5 years, and so on. The approach often used by analysts is to interpolate

between the bond price data before it is used to calculate the zero curve. For example, if
it is known that a 2.3-year bond with a coupon of 6% sells for 98 and a 2.7-year bond
with a coupon of 6.5% sells for 99, it might be assumed that a 2.5-year bond with a
coupon of 6.25% would sell for 98.5.
4.6
FORWARD RATES
Forward interest rates are the future rates of interest implied by current zero rates for
periods of time in the future. To illustrate how they are calculated, we suppose that zero
rates are as shown in the second column of Table 4.5. The rates are assumed to be
continuously compounded. Thus, the 3% per annum rate for 1 year means that, in
return for an investment of $100 today, an amount 100e0:031 ¼ $103:05 is received in
1 year; the 4% per annum rate for 2 years means that, in return for an investment of
$100 today, an amount 100e0:042 ¼ $108:33 is received in 2 years; and so on.
The forward interest rate in Table 4.5 for year 2 is 5% per annum. This is the rate of
interest that is implied by the zero rates for the period of time between the end of the
ﬁrst year and the end of the second year. It can be calculated from the 1-year zero
interest rate of 3% per annum and the 2-year zero interest rate of 4% per annum. It is
the rate of interest for year 2 that, when combined with 3% per annum for year 1, gives
4% overall for the 2 years. To show that the correct answer is 5% per annum, suppose
that $100 is invested. A rate of 3% for the ﬁrst year and 5% for the second year gives
100e0:031e0:051 ¼ $108:33
at the end of the second year. A rate of 4% per annum for 2 years gives
100e0:042
which is also $108.33. This example illustrates the general result that when interest rates
are continuously compounded and rates in successive time periods are combined, the
overall equivalent rate is simply the average rate during the whole period. In our
example, 3% for the ﬁrst year and 5% for the second year average to 4% over

CHAPTER 4

the 2 years. The result is only approximately true when the rates are not continuously
compounded.
The forward rate for year 3 is the rate of interest that is implied by a 4% per annum
2-year zero rate and a 4.6% per annum 3-year zero rate. It is 5.8% per annum. The
reason is that an investment for 2 years at 4% per annum combined with an investment
for one year at 5.8% per annum gives an overall average return for the three years of
4.6% per annum. The other forward rates can be calculated similarly and are shown in
the third column of the table. In general, if R1 and R2 are the zero rates for maturities
T1 and T2, respectively, and RF is the forward interest rate for the period of time
between T1 and T2, then
RF ¼ R2T2  R1T1
T2  T1
ð4:5Þ
To illustrate this formula, consider the calculation of the year-4 forward rate from the
data in Table 4.5: T1 ¼ 3, T2 ¼ 4, R1 ¼ 0:046, and R2 ¼ 0:05, and the formula gives
RF ¼ 0:062.
Equation (4.5) can be written as
RF ¼ R2 þ ðR2  R1Þ
T1
T2  T1
ð4:6Þ
This shows that, if the zero curve is upward sloping between T1 and T2 so that R2 > R1,
then RF > R2 (i.e., the forward rate for a period of time ending at T2 is greater than the
T2 zero rate). Similarly, if the zero curve is downward sloping with R2 < R1, then
RF < R2 (i.e., the forward rate is less than the T2 zero rate). Taking limits as T2
approaches T1 in equation (4.6) and letting the common value of the two be T, we
obtain
RF ¼ R þ T @R
@T
where R is the zero rate for a maturity of T. The value of RF obtained in this way is
known as the instantaneous forward rate for a maturity of T. This is the forward rate
that is applicable to a very short future time period that begins at time T. Deﬁne Pð0; TÞ
as the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T. Because Pð0; TÞ ¼ eRT, the

equation for the instantaneous forward rate can also be written as

If a large ﬁnancial institution can borrow or lend at the rates in Table 4.5, it can lock
in the forward rates. For example, it can borrow $100 at 3% for 1 year and invest the
money at 4% for 2 years, the result is a cash outﬂow of 100e0:031 ¼ $103:05 at the end
of year 1 and an inﬂow of 100e0:042 ¼ $108:33 at the end of year 2. Since 108:33 ¼
103:05e0:05, a return equal to the forward rate (5%) is earned on $103.05 during the
second year. Alternatively, it can borrow $100 for four years at 5% and invest it for
three years at 4.6%. The result is a cash inﬂow of 100e0:0463 ¼ $114:80 at the end of the
third year and a cash outﬂow of 100e0:054 ¼ $122:14 at the end of the fourth year.
Since 122:14 ¼ 114:80e0:062, money is being borrowed for the fourth year at the forward
rate of 6.2%.
If a large investor thinks that rates in the future will be diﬀerent from today’s forward
rates, there are many trading strategies that the investor will ﬁnd attractive (see Business
Snapshot 4.1). One of these involves entering into a contract known as a forward rate
agreement. We will now discuss how this contract works and how it is valued.
4.7
FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS
A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an over-the-counter transaction designed to ﬁx the
interest rate that will apply to either borrowing or lending a certain principal during a
speciﬁed future period of time. The usual assumption underlying the contract is that the
borrowing or lending would normally be done at LIBOR.
If the agreed ﬁxed rate is greater than the actual LIBOR rate for the period, the
borrower pays the lender the diﬀerence between the two applied to the principal. If the
reverse is true, the lender pays the borrower the diﬀerence applied to the principal.
Because interest is paid in arrears, the payment of the interest rate diﬀerential is due at
the end of the speciﬁed period of time. Usually, however, the present value of the
payment is made at the beginning of the speciﬁed period, as illustrated in Example 4.3.
Example 4.3
Suppose that a company enters into an FRA that is designed to ensure it will
receive a ﬁxed rate of 4% on a principal of $100 million for a 3-month period
starting in 3 years. The FRA is an exchange where LIBOR is paid and 4% is
received for the 3-month period. If 3-month LIBOR proves to be 4.5% for the
3-month period, the cash ﬂow to the lender will be
100,000,000  ð0:04  0:045Þ  0:25 ¼ $125,000
at the 3.25-year point. This is equivalent to a cash ﬂow of

125,000
1 þ 0:045  0:25 ¼ $123,609
at the 3-year point. The cash ﬂow to the party on the opposite side of the trans-
110
CHAPTER 4

action will be þ$125,000 at the 3.25-year point or þ$123,609 at the 3-year point.
(All interest rates in this example are expressed with quarterly compounding.)
Consider an FRA where company X is agreeing to lend money to company Y for the
period of time between T1 and T2. Deﬁne:
RK:
The ﬁxed rate of interest agreed to in the FRA
RF :
The forward LIBOR interest rate for the period between times T1 and T2,
calculated today5
RM :
The actual LIBOR interest rate observed in the market at time T1 for the
period between times T1 and T2
L:
The principal underlying the contract.
We will depart from our usual assumption of continuous compounding and assume
that the rates RK, RF, and RM are all measured with a compounding frequency
reﬂecting the length of the period to which they apply. This means that if
T2  T1 ¼ 0:5, they are expressed with semiannual compounding; if T2  T1 ¼ 0:25,
they are expressed with quarterly compounding; and so on. (This assumption corres-
ponds to the usual market practice for FRAs.)
Normally company X would earn RM from the LIBOR loan. The FRA means that it
will earn RK. The extra interest rate (which may be negative) that it earns as a result of
Business Snapshot 4.1
Orange County’s Yield Curve Plays
Suppose a large investor can borrow or lend at the rates given in Table 4.5 and thinks
that 1-year interest rates will not change much over the next 5 years. The investor can
borrow 1-year funds and invest for 5-years. The 1-year borrowings can be rolled over
for further 1-year periods at the end of the ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth years. If
interest rates do stay about the same, this strategy will yield a proﬁt of about 2.3%
per year, because interest will be received at 5.3% and paid at 3%. This type of
trading strategy is known as a yield curve play. The investor is speculating that rates in
the future will be quite diﬀerent from the forward rates observed in the market today.
(In our example, forward rates observed in the market today for future 1-year periods
are 5%, 5.8%, 6.2%, and 6.5%.)
Robert Citron, the Treasurer at Orange County, used yield curve plays similar to
the one we have just described very successfully in 1992 and 1993. The proﬁt from
Mr. Citron’s trades became an important contributor to Orange County’s budget
and he was re-elected. (No one listened to his opponent in the election, who said his
trading strategy was too risky.)
In 1994 Mr. Citron expanded his yield curve plays. He invested heavily in inverse
ﬂoaters. These pay a rate of interest equal to a ﬁxed rate of interest minus a ﬂoating
rate. He also leveraged his position by borrowing in the repo market. If short-term
interest rates had remained the same or declined he would have continued to do well.
As it happened, interest rates rose sharply during 1994. On December 1, 1994,
Orange County announced that its investment portfolio had lost $1.5 billion and
several days later it ﬁled for bankruptcy protection.
5 The calculation of forward LIBOR rates is discussed in Chapters 7 and 9.
Interest Rates

entering into the FRA is RK  RM. The interest rate is set at time T1 and paid at
time T2. The extra interest rate therefore leads to a cash ﬂow to company X at time T2 of
LðRK  RMÞðT2  T1Þ
ð4:7Þ
Similarly there is a cash ﬂow to company Y at time T2 of
LðRM  RKÞðT2  T1Þ
ð4:8Þ
From equations (4.7) and (4.8), we see that there is another interpretation of the
FRA. It is an agreement where company X will receive interest on the principal between
T1 and T2 at the ﬁxed rate of RK and pay interest at the realized LIBOR rate of RM.
Company Y will pay interest on the principal between T1 and T2 at the ﬁxed rate of RK
and receive interest at RM. This interpretation of an FRA will be important when we
consider interest rate swaps in Chapter 7.
As mentioned, FRAs are usually settled at time T1 rather than T2. The payoﬀmust
then be discounted from time T2 to T1. For company X, the payoﬀat time T1 is
LðRK  RMÞðT2  T1Þ
1 þ RMðT2  T1Þ
and, for company Y, the payoﬀat time T1 is
LðRM  RKÞðT2  T1Þ
1 þ RMðT2  T1Þ
Valuation
An FRA is worth zero when the ﬁxed rate RK equals the forward rate RF.6 When it is
ﬁrst entered into RK is set equal to the current value of RF, so that the value of the
contract to each side is zero.7 As time passes, interest rates change, so that the value is
no longer zero.
The market value of a derivative at a particular time is referred to as its mark-to-
market, or MTM, value. To calculate the MTM value of an FRA where the ﬁxed rate of
interest is being received, we imagine a portfolio consisting of two FRAs. The ﬁrst FRA
states that RK will be received on a principal of L between times T1 and T2. The second
FRA states that RF will be paid on a principal of L between times T1 and T2. The payoﬀ
from the ﬁrst FRA at time T2 is LðRK  RMÞðT2  T1Þ and the payoﬀfrom the second
FRA at time T2 is LðRM  RFÞðT2  T1Þ. The total payoﬀis LðRK  RFÞðT2  T1Þ and is
6 This can be regarded as the deﬁnition of what we mean by forward LIBOR. In an idealized situation where
a bank can borrow or lend at LIBOR, it can artiﬁcially create a contract where it earns or pays forward
LIBOR, as shown in Section 4.6. For example, it can ensure that it earns a forward rate between years 2 and 3
by borrowing a certain amount of money for 2 years and investing it for 3 years. Similarly, it can ensure that
it pays a forward rate between years 2 and 3 by borrowing a certain amount of money for 3 years and lending
it for 2 years.
7 In practice, this is not quite true. A market maker such as a bank will quote a bid and oﬀer for RK, the bid
corresponding to the situation where it is paying RK and the oﬀer corresponding to the situation where it is
receiving RK. An FRA at inception will therefore have a small positive value to the bank and a small negative
value to its counterparty.

known for certain today. The portfolio is therefore a risk-free investment and its value
today is the payoﬀat time T2 discounted at the risk-free rate or
LðRK  RFÞðT2  T1ÞeR2T2
where R2 is the continously compounded riskless zero rate for a maturity T2.8 Because
the value of the second FRA, where RF is paid, is zero, the value of the ﬁrst FRA,
where RK is received, must be
VFRA ¼ LðRK  RFÞðT2  T1ÞeR2T2
ð4:9Þ
Similarly, the value of an FRA where RK is paid is
VFRA ¼ LðRF  RKÞðT2  T1ÞeR2T2
ð4:10Þ
By comparing equations (4.7) and (4.9), or equations (4.8) and (4.10), we see that an
FRA can be valued if we:
1. Calculate the payoﬀon the assumption that forward rates are realized (that is, on
the assumption that RM ¼ RF).
2. Discount this payoﬀat the risk-free rate.
We will use this result when we value swaps (which are porfolios of FRAs) in Chapter 7.
Example 4.4
Suppose that the forward LIBOR rate for the period between time 1.5 years and
time 2 years in the future is 5% (with semiannual compounding) and that some
time ago a company entered into an FRA where it will receive 5.8% (with semi-
annual compounding) and pay LIBOR on a principal of $100 million for the
period. The 2-year risk-free rate is 4% (with continuous compounding). From
equation (4.9), the value of the FRA is
100,000,000  ð0:058  0:050Þ  0:5e0:042 ¼ $369,200
4.8
DURATION
The duration of a bond, as its name implies, is a measure of how long on average the
holder of the bond has to wait before receiving cash payments. A zero-coupon bond
that lasts n years has a duration of n years. However, a coupon-bearing bond lasting
n years has a duration of less than n years, because the holder receives some of the cash
payments prior to year n.
Suppose that a bond provides the holder with cash ﬂows ci at time ti (1 6 i 6 n). The
bond price B and bond yield y (continuously compounded) are related by

The term in square brackets is the ratio of the present value of the cash ﬂow at time ti to
the bond price. The bond price is the present value of all payments. The duration is
therefore a weighted average of the times when payments are made, with the weight
applied to time ti being equal to the proportion of the bond’s total present value
provided by the cash ﬂow at time ti. The sum of the weights is 1.0. Note that, for the
purposes of the deﬁnition of duration, all discounting is done at the bond yield rate of
interest, y. (We do not use a diﬀerent zero rate for each cash ﬂow in the way described in
Section 4.4.)
When a small change y in the yield is considered, it is approximately true that

(Note that there is a negative relationship between B and y. When bond yields increase,
bond prices decrease. When bond yields decrease, bond prices increase.) From equa-

B ¼ BD y
ð4:15Þ
This can be written
B
B ¼ D y
ð4:16Þ
Equation (4.16) is an approximate relationship between percentage changes in a bond
price and changes in its yield. It is easy to use and is the reason why duration, ﬁrst
suggested by Frederick Macaulay in 1938, has become such a popular measure.
Consider a 3-year 10% coupon bond with a face value of $100. Suppose that the yield
on the bond is 12% per annum with continuous compounding. This means that
y ¼ 0:12. Coupon payments of $5 are made every 6 months. Table 4.6 shows the
calculations necessary to determine the bond’s duration. The present values of the
bond’s cash ﬂows, using the yield as the discount rate, are shown in column 3 (e.g., the
present value of the ﬁrst cash ﬂow is 5e0:120:5 ¼ 4:709). The sum of the numbers in
column 3 gives the bond’s price as 94.213. The weights are calculated by dividing the
numbers in column 3 by 94.213. The sum of the numbers in column 5 gives the duration
as 2.653 years.
DV01 is the price change from a 1-basis-point increase in all rates. Gamma is the
change in DV01 from a 1-basis-point increase in all rates. The following example
investigates the accuracy of the duration relationship in equation (4.15).
114
CHAPTER 4

Example 4.5
For the bond in Table 4.6, the bond price, B, is 94.213 and the duration, D, is
2.653, so that equation (4.15) gives
B ¼ 94:213  2:653  y
or
B ¼ 249:95  y
When the yield on the bond increases by 10 basis points (¼ 0:1%), y ¼ þ0:001.
The duration relationship predicts that B ¼ 249:95  0:001 ¼ 0:250, so that
the bond price goes down to 94:213  0:250 ¼ 93:963. How accurate is this?
Valuing the bond in terms of its yield in the usual way, we ﬁnd that, when the
bond yield increases by 10 basis points to 12.1%, the bond price is
5e0:1210:5 þ 5e0:1211:0 þ 5e0:1211:5 þ 5e0:1212:0
þ5e0:1212:5 þ 105e0:1213:0 ¼ 93:963
which is (to three decimal places) the same as that predicted by the duration
relationship.
Modiﬁed Duration
The preceding analysis is based on the assumption that y is expressed with continuous
compounding. If y is expressed with annual compounding, it can be shown that the
approximate relationship in equation (4.15) becomes
B ¼  BD y
1 þ y
More generally, if y is expressed with a compounding frequency of m times per year,
then

A variable D, deﬁned by

is sometimes referred to as the bond’s modiﬁed duration. It allows the duration relation-
ship to be simpliﬁed to
B ¼ BDy
ð4:17Þ
when y is expressed with a compounding frequency of m times per year. The following
example investigates the accuracy of the modiﬁed duration relationship.
Example 4.6
The bond in Table 4.6 has a price of 94.213 and a duration of 2.653. The yield,

From equation (4.17),
B ¼ 94:213  2:4985  y
or
B ¼ 235:39  y
When the yield (semiannually compounded) increases by 10 basis points (¼ 0:1%),
we have y ¼ þ0:001. The duration relationship predicts that we expect B to be
235:39  0:001 ¼ 0:235, so that the bond price goes down to 94:213  0:235 ¼
93:978. How accurate is this? An exact calculation similar to that in the previous
example shows that, when the bond yield (semiannually compounded) increases by
10 basis points to 12.4673%, the bond price becomes 93.978. This shows that the
modiﬁed duration calculation gives good accuracy for small yield changes.
Another term that is sometimes used is dollar duration. This is the product of modiﬁed
duration and bond price, so that B ¼ D$y, where D$ is dollar duration.
Bond Portfolios
The duration, D, of a bond portfolio can be deﬁned as a weighted average of the
durations of the individual bonds in the portfolio, with the weights being proportional
to the bond prices. Equations (4.15) to (4.17) then apply, with B being deﬁned as the
value of the bond portfolio. They estimate the change in the value of the bond portfolio
for a small change y in the yields of all the bonds.
It is important to realize that, when duration is used for bond portfolios, there is an
implicit assumption that the yields of all bonds will change by approximately the same
amount. When the bonds have widely diﬀering maturities, this happens only when there
is a parallel shift in the zero-coupon yield curve. We should therefore interpret
equations (4.15) to (4.17) as providing estimates of the impact on the price of a bond
portfolio of a small parallel shift, y, in the zero curve.
By choosing a portfolio so that the duration of assets equals the duration of liabilities
(i.e., the net duration is zero), a ﬁnancial institution eliminates its exposure to small
parallel shifts in the yield curve. But it is still exposed to shifts that are either large or
nonparallel.

CONVEXITY
The duration relationship applies only to small changes in yields. This is illustrated in
Figure 4.2, which shows the relationship between the percentage change in value and
change in yield for two bond portfolios having the same duration. The gradients of
the two curves are the same at the origin. This means that both bond portfolios
change in value by the same percentage for small yield changes and is consistent with
equation (4.16). For large yield changes, the portfolios behave diﬀerently. Portfolio X
has more curvature in its relationship with yields than portfolio Y. A factor known as
convexity measures this curvature and can be used to improve the relationship in
equation (4.16).

For a portfolio with a particular duration, the convexity of a bond portfolio tends to be
greatest when the portfolio provides payments evenly over a long period of time. It is
least when the payments are concentrated around one particular point in time. By

choosing a portfolio of assets and liabilities with a net duration of zero and a net
convexity of zero, a ﬁnancial institution can make itself immune to relatively large
parallel shifts in the zero curve. However, it is still exposed to nonparallel shifts.
4.10
THEORIES OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
It is natural to ask what determines the shape of the zero curve. Why is it sometimes
downward sloping, sometimes upward sloping, and sometimes partly upward sloping
and partly downward sloping? A number of diﬀerent theories have been proposed. The
simplest is expectations theory, which conjectures that long-term interest rates should
reﬂect expected future short-term interest rates. More precisely, it argues that a forward
interest rate corresponding to a certain future period is equal to the expected future zero
interest rate for that period. Another idea, market segmentation theory, conjectures that
there need be no relationship between short-, medium-, and long-term interest rates.
Under the theory, a major investor such as a large pension fund or an insurance
company invests in bonds of a certain maturity and does not readily switch from one
maturity to another. The short-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand
in the short-term bond market; the medium-term interest rate is determined by supply
and demand in the medium-term bond market; and so on.
The theory that is most appealing is liquidity preference theory. The basic assumption
underlying the theory is that investors prefer to preserve their liquidity and invest funds
for short periods of time. Borrowers, on the other hand, usually prefer to borrow at ﬁxed
rates for long periods of time. This leads to a situation in which forward rates are greater
than expected future zero rates. The theory is also consistent with the empirical result
that yield curves tend to be upward sloping more often than they are downward sloping.
The Management of Net Interest Income
To understand liquidity preference theory, it is useful to consider the interest rate risk
faced by banks when they take deposits and make loans. The net interest income of the
bank is the excess of the interest received over the interest paid and needs to be carefully
managed.
Consider a simple situation where a bank oﬀers consumers a one-year and a ﬁve-year
deposit rate as well as a one-year and ﬁve-year mortgage rate. The rates are shown in
Table 4.7. We make the simplifying assumption that the expected one-year interest rate
for future time periods to equal the one-year rates prevailing in the market today.
Loosely speaking this means that the market considers interest rate increases to be just
as likely as interest rate decreases. As a result, the rates in Table 4.7 are ‘‘fair’’ in that
they reﬂect the market’s expectations (i.e., they correspond to expectations theory).

CHAPTER 4

Investing money for one year and reinvesting for four further one-year periods give the
same expected overall return as a single ﬁve-year investment. Similarly, borrowing
money for one year and reﬁnancing each year for the next four years leads to the same
expected ﬁnancing costs as a single ﬁve-year loan.
Suppose you have money to deposit and agree with the prevailing view that interest
rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose to deposit
your money for one year at 3% per annum or for ﬁve years at 3% per annum? The
chances are that you would choose one year because this gives you more ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility. It ties up your funds for a shorter period of time.
Now suppose that you want a mortgage. Again you agree with the prevailing view
that interest rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose
a one-year mortgage at 6% or a ﬁve-year mortgage at 6%? The chances are that you
would choose a ﬁve-year mortgage because it ﬁxes your borrowing rate for the next ﬁve
years and subjects you to less reﬁnancing risk.
When the bank posts the rates shown in Table 4.7, it is likely to ﬁnd that the majority
of its depositors opt for one-year deposits and the majority of its borrowers opt for ﬁve-
year mortgages. This creates an asset/liability mismatch for the bank and subjects it to
risks. There is no problem if interest rates fall. The bank will ﬁnd itself ﬁnancing the
ﬁve-year 6% loans with deposits that cost less than 3% in the future and net interest
income will increase. However, if rates rise, the deposits that are ﬁnancing these 6%
loans will cost more than 3% in the future and net interest income will decline. A 3%
rise in interest rates would reduce the net interest income to zero.
It is the job of the asset/liability management group to ensure that the maturities of
the assets on which interest is earned and the maturities of the liabilities on which
interest is paid are matched. One way it can do this is by increasing the ﬁve-year rate on
both deposits and mortgages. For example, it could move to the situation in Table 4.8
where the ﬁve-year deposit rate is 4% and the ﬁve-year mortgage rate 7%. This would
make ﬁve-year deposits relatively more attractive and one-year mortgages relatively
more attractive. Some customers who chose one-year deposits when the rates were as in
Table 4.7 will switch to ﬁve-year deposits in the Table 4.8 situation. Some customers
who chose ﬁve-year mortgages when the rates were as in Table 4.7 will choose one-year
mortgages. This may lead to the maturities of assets and liabilities being matched. If
there is still an imbalance with depositors tending to choose a one-year maturity and
borrowers a ﬁve-year maturity, ﬁve-year deposit and mortgage rates could be increased
even further. Eventually the imbalance will disappear.
The net result of all banks behaving in the way we have just described is liquidity
preference theory. Long-term rates tend to be higher than those that would be predicted
by expected future short-term rates. The yield curve is upward sloping most of the time. It
is downward sloping only when the market expects a steep decline in short-term rates.

maturities of assets and liabilities.

Many banks now have sophisticated systems for monitoring the decisions being made
by customers so that, when they detect small diﬀerences between the maturities of the
assets and liabilities being chosen by customers they can ﬁne tune the rates they oﬀer.
Sometimes derivatives such as interest rate swaps (which will be discussed in Chapter 7)
are also used to manage their exposure. The result of all this is that net interest income
is usually very stable. This has not always been the case. In the United States, the failure
of Savings and Loan companies in the 1980s and the failure of Continental Illinois in
1984 were to a large extent a result of the fact that they did not match the maturities of
assets and liabilities. Both failures proved to be very expensive for US taxpayers.
Liquidity
In addition to creating problems in the way that has been described, a portfolio where
maturities are mismatched can lead to liquidity problems. Consider a ﬁnancial institu-
tion that funds 5-year ﬁxed rate loans with wholesale deposits that last only 3 months.
It might recognize its exposure to rising interest rates and hedge its interest rate risk.
(One way of doing this is by using interest rate swaps, as mentioned earlier.) However,
it still has a liquidity risk. Wholesale depositors may, for some reason, lose conﬁdence
in the ﬁnancial institution and refuse to continue to provide the ﬁnancial institution
with short-term funding. The ﬁnancial institution, even if it has adequate equity
capital, will then experience a severe liquidity problem that could lead to its downfall.
As described in Business Snapshot 4.2, these types of liquidity problems were the root
cause of some of the failures of ﬁnancial institutions during the crisis that started
in 2007.
SUMMARY
Two important interest rates for derivative traders are Treasury rates and LIBOR rates.
Treasury rates are the rates paid by a government on borrowings in its own currency.
LIBOR rates are short-term lending rates oﬀered by banks in the interbank market.
Business Snapshot 4.2
Liquidity and the 2007–2009 Financial Crisis
During the credit crisis that started in July 2007 there was a ‘‘ﬂight to quality,’’ where
ﬁnancial institutions and investors looked for safe investments and were less inclined
than before to take credit risks. Financial institutions that relied on short-term
funding experienced liquidity problems. One example is Northern Rock in the United
Kingdom, which chose to ﬁnance much of its mortgage portfolio with wholesale
deposits, some lasting only 3 months. Starting in September 2007, the depositors
became nervous and refused to roll over the funding they were providing to Northern
Rock, i.e., at the end of a 3-month period they would refuse to deposit their funds for
a further 3-month period. As a result, Northern Rock was unable to ﬁnance its assets.
It was taken over by the UK government in early 2008. In the US, ﬁnancial
institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers experienced similar liquidity
problems because they had chosen to fund part of their operations with short-term
funds.

CHAPTER 4

The compounding frequency used for an interest rate deﬁnes the units in which it is
measured. The diﬀerence between an annually compounded rate and a quarterly
compounded rate is analogous to the diﬀerence between a distance measured in miles
and a distance measured in kilometers. Traders frequently use continuous compound-
ing when analyzing the value of options and more complex derivatives.
Many diﬀerent types of interest rates are quoted in ﬁnancial markets and calculated by
analysts. The n-year zero or spot rate is the rate applicable to an investment lasting for
n years when all of the return is realized at the end. The par yield on a bond of a certain
maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond to sell for its par value. Forward rates are
the rates applicable to future periods of time implied by today’s zero rates.
The method most commonly used to calculate zero rates is known as the bootstrap
method. It involves starting with short-term instruments and moving progressively to
longer-term instruments, making sure that the zero rates calculated at each stage are
consistent with the prices of the instruments. It is used daily by trading desks to
calculate a Treasury zero-rate curve.
A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an over-the-counter agreement that an interest
rate (usually LIBOR) will be exchanged for a speciﬁed interest rate during a speciﬁed
future period of time. An FRA can be valued by assuming that forward rates are
realized and discounting the resulting payoﬀ.
An important concept in interest rate markets is duration. Duration measures the
sensitivity of the value of a bond portfolio to a small parallel shift in the zero-coupon
yield curve. Speciﬁcally,
B ¼ BD y
where B is the value of the bond portfolio, D is the duration of the portfolio, y is the
size of a small parallel shift in the zero curve, and B is the resultant eﬀect on the value
of the bond portfolio.
Liquidity preference theory can be used to explain the interest rate term structures
that are observed in practice. The theory argues that most entities like to borrow long
and lend short. To match the maturities of borrowers and lenders, it is necessary for
ﬁnancial institutions to raise long-term rates so that forward interest rates are higher
than expected future spot interest rates.

Determination of
Forward and
Futures Prices
In this chapter we examine how forward prices and futures prices are related to the spot
price of the underlying asset. Forward contracts are easier to analyze than futures
contracts because there is no daily settlement—only a single payment at maturity. We
therefore start this chapter by considering the relationship between the forward price
and the spot price. Luckily it can be shown that the forward price and futures price of
an asset are usually very close when the maturities of the two contracts are the same.
This is convenient because it means that results obtained for forwards are usually also
true for futures.
In the ﬁrst part of the chapter we derive some important general results on the
relationship between forward (or futures) prices and spot prices. We then use the results
to examine the relationship between futures prices and spot prices for contracts on stock
indices, foreign exchange, and commodities. We will consider interest rate futures
contracts in the next chapter.
5.1
INVESTMENT ASSETS vs. CONSUMPTION ASSETS
When considering forward and futures contracts, it is important to distinguish between
investment assets and consumption assets. An investment asset is an asset that is held
for investment purposes by at least some traders. Stocks and bonds are clearly
investment assets. Gold and silver are also examples of investment assets. Note that
investment assets do not have to be held exclusively for investment. (Silver, for
example, has a number of industrial uses.) However, they do have to satisfy the
requirement that they are held by some traders solely for investment. A consumption
asset is an asset that is held primarily for consumption. It is not normally held for
investment. Examples of consumption assets are commodities such as copper, crude
oil, corn, and pork bellies.
As we shall see later in this chapter, we can use arbitrage arguments to determine
the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other
observable market variables. We cannot do this for consumption assets.

5.2
SHORT SELLING
Some of the arbitrage strategies presented in this chapter involve short selling. This
trade, usually simply referred to as ‘‘shorting’’, involves selling an asset that is not
owned. It is something that is possible for some—but not all—investment assets. We
will illustrate how it works by considering a short sale of shares of a stock.
Suppose an investor instructs a broker to short 500 shares of company X. The broker
will carry out the instructions by borrowing the shares from someone who owns them and
selling them in the market in the usual way. At some later stage, the investor will close out
the position by purchasing 500 shares of company X in the market. These shares are then
used to replace the borrowed shares so that the short position is closed out. The investor
takes a proﬁt if the stock price has declined and a loss if it has risen. If at any time while
the contract is open the broker has to return the borrowed shares and there are no other
shares that can be borrowed, the investor is forced to close out the position, even if not
ready to do so. Sometimes a fee is charged for lending the shares to the party doing the
shorting.
An investor with a short position must pay to the broker any income, such as
dividends or interest, that would normally be received on the securities that have been
shorted. The broker will transfer this income to the account of the client from whom
the securities have been borrowed. Consider the position of an investor who shorts
500 shares in April when the price per share is $120 and closes out the position by
buying them back in July when the price per share is $100. Suppose that a dividend of
$1 per share is paid in May. The investor receives 500  $120 ¼ $60,000 in April when
the short position is initiated. The dividend leads to a payment by the investor of
500  $1 ¼ $500 in May. The investor also pays 500  $100 ¼ $50,000 for shares when
the position is closed out in July. The net gain, therefore, is
$60,000  $500  $50,000 ¼ $9,500
assuming there is no fee for borrowing the shares. Table 5.1 illustrates this example and
shows that the cash ﬂows from the short sale are the mirror image of the cash ﬂows
from purchasing the shares in April and selling them in July. (Again, this assumes no
borrowing fee.)

The investor is required to maintain a margin account with the broker. The margin
account consists of cash or marketable securities deposited by the investor with the
broker to guarantee that the investor will not walk away from the short position if the
share price increases. It is similar to the margin account discussed in Chapter 2 for
futures contracts. An initial margin is required and if there are adverse movements (i.e.,
increases) in the price of the asset that is being shorted, additional margin may be
required. If the additional margin is not provided, the short position is closed out. The
margin account does not represent a cost to the investor. This is because interest is
usually paid on the balance in margin accounts and, if the interest rate oﬀered is
unacceptable, marketable securities such as Treasury bills can be used to meet margin
requirements. The proceeds of the sale of the asset belong to the investor and normally
form part of the initial margin.
From time to time regulations are changed on short selling. In 1938, the uptick rule
was introduced. This allowed shares to be shorted only on an ‘‘uptick’’—that is, when
the most recent movement in the share price was an increase. The SEC abolished the
uptick rule in July 2007, but introduced an ‘‘alternative uptick’’ rule in February 2010.
Under this rule, when the price of a stock has decreased by more than 10% in one day,
there are restrictions on short selling for that day and the next. These restrictions are
that the stock can be shorted only at a price that is higher than the best current bid
price. Occasionally there are temporary bans on short selling. This happened in a
number of countries in 2008 because it was considered that short selling contributed to
the high market volatility that was being experienced.

ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION
In this chapter we will assume that the following are all true for some market
participants:
1. The market participants are subject to no transaction costs when they trade.
2. The market participants are subject to the same tax rate on all net trading proﬁts.
3. The market participants can borrow money at the same risk-free rate of interest as
they can lend money.
4. The market participants take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur.
Note that we do not require these assumptions to be true for all market participants. All
that we require is that they be true—or at least approximately true—for a few key
market participants such as large derivatives dealers. It is the trading activities of these
key market participants and their eagerness to take advantage of arbitrage opportun-
ities as they occur that determine the relationship between forward and spot prices.
The following notation will be used throughout this chapter:
T : Time until delivery date in a forward or futures contract (in years)
S0: Price of the asset underlying the forward or futures contract today
F0: Forward or futures price today
r: Zero-coupon risk-free rate of interest per annum, expressed with continuous
compounding, for an investment maturing at the delivery date (i.e., in T years).
128
CHAPTER 5

The risk-free rate, r, is the rate at which money is borrowed or lent when there is no credit
risk, so that the money is certain to be repaid. As discussed in Chapter 4, participants in
derivatives markets have traditionally used LIBOR as a proxy for the risk-free rate, but
events during the crisis have led them to switch to other alternatives in some instances
(see Chapter 9 for a further discussion of this).
5.4
FORWARD PRICE FOR AN INVESTMENT ASSET
The easiest forward contract to value is one written on an investment asset that provides
the holder with no income. Non-dividend-paying stocks and zero-coupon bonds are
examples of such investment assets.
Consider a long forward contract to purchase a non-dividend-paying stock in
3 months.1 Assume the current stock price is $40 and the 3-month risk-free interest
rate is 5% per annum.
Suppose ﬁrst that the forward price is relatively high at $43. An arbitrageur can borrow
$40 at the risk-free interest rate of 5% per annum, buy one share, and short a forward
contract to sell one share in 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, the arbitrageur delivers
the share and receives $43. The sum of money required to pay oﬀthe loan is
40e0:053=12 ¼ $40:50
By following this strategy, the arbitrageur locks in a proﬁt of $43:00  $40:50 ¼ $2:50
at the end of the 3-month period.
Suppose next that the forward price is relatively low at $39. An arbitrageur can
short one share, invest the proceeds of the short sale at 5% per annum for 3 months,
and take a long position in a 3-month forward contract. The proceeds of the short
sale grow to 40e0:053=12 or $40.50 in 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, the
arbitrageur pays $39, takes delivery of the share under the terms of the forward
contract, and uses it to close out the short position. A net gain of
$40:50  $39:00 ¼ $1:50
is therefore made at the end of the 3 months. The two trading strategies we have
considered are summarized in Table 5.2.
Under what circumstances do arbitrage opportunities such as those in Table 5.2 not
exist? The ﬁrst arbitrage works when the forward price is greater than $40.50. The
second arbitrage works when the forward price is less than $40.50. We deduce that for
there to be no arbitrage the forward price must be exactly $40.50.
A Generalization
To generalize this example, we consider a forward contract on an investment asset with
price S0 that provides no income. Using our notation, T is the time to maturity, r is the
risk-free rate, and F0 is the forward price. The relationship between F0 and S0 is
F0 ¼ S0erT
ð5:1Þ
1 Forward contracts on individual stocks do not often arise in practice. However, they form useful examples
for developing our ideas. Futures on individual stocks started trading in the United States in November 2002.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices
129

If F0 > S0erT, arbitrageurs can buy the asset and short forward contracts on the asset. If
F0 < S0erT, they can short the asset and enter into long forward contracts on it.2 In our
example, S0 ¼ 40, r ¼ 0:05, and T ¼ 0:25, so that equation (5.1) gives
F0 ¼ 40e0:050:25 ¼ $40:50
which is in agreement with our earlier calculations.
A long forward contract and a spot purchase both lead to the asset being owned at
time T. The forward price is higher than the spot price because of the cost of
ﬁnancing the spot purchase of the asset during the life of the forward contract. This
point was overlooked by Kidder Peabody in 1994, much to its cost (see Business
Snapshot 5.1).
Example 5.1
Consider a 4-month forward contract to buy a zero-coupon bond that will mature
1 year from today. (This means that the bond will have 8 months to go when the
forward contract matures.) The current price of the bond is $930. We assume that
the 4-month risk-free rate of interest (continuously compounded) is 6% per an-
num. Because zero-coupon bonds provide no income, we can use equation (5.1)
with T ¼ 4=12, r ¼ 0:06, and S0 ¼ 930. The forward price, F0, is given by
F0 ¼ 930e0:064=12 ¼ $948:79
This would be the delivery price in a contract negotiated today.
Table 5.2
Arbitrage opportunities when forward price is out of line with spot
price for asset providing no income. (Asset price ¼ $40; interest rate ¼ 5%;
maturity of forward contract ¼ 3 months.)
Forward Price ¼ $43
Forward Price ¼ $39

Borrow $40 at 5% for 3 months

Proﬁt realized ¼ $1.50
2 For another way of seeing that equation (5.1) is correct, consider the following strategy: buy one unit of the
asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for F0 at time T. This costs S0 and is certain to lead to a
cash inﬂow of F0 at time T. Therefore S0 must equal the present value of F0; that is, S0 ¼ F0erT , or
equivalently F0 ¼ S0erT.
130
CHAPTER 5

What If Short Sales Are Not Possible?
Short sales are not possible for all investment assets and sometimes a fee is charged for
borrowing assets. As it happens, this does not matter. To derive equation (5.1), we do
not need to be able to short the asset. All that we require is that there be market
participants who hold the asset purely for investment (and by deﬁnition this is always
true of an investment asset). If the forward price is too low, they will ﬁnd it attractive to
sell the asset and take a long position in a forward contract.
Suppose that the underlying investment asset gives rise to no storage costs or income.
If F0 > S0erT, an investor can adopt the following strategy:
1. Borrow S0 dollars at an interest rate r for T years.
2. Buy 1 unit of the asset.
3. Short a forward contract on 1 unit of the asset.
At time T, the asset is sold for F0. An amount S0erT is required to repay the loan at this
time and the investor makes a proﬁt of F0  S0erT.
Suppose next that F0 < S0erT. In this case, an investor who owns the asset can:
1. Sell the asset for S0.
2. Invest the proceeds at interest rate r for time T.
3. Take a long position in a forward contract on 1 unit of the asset.
At time T, the cash invested has grown to S0erT. The asset is repurchased for F0 and the
investor makes a proﬁt of S0erT  F0 relative to the position the investor would have
been in if the asset had been kept.
As in the non-dividend-paying stock example considered earlier, we can expect the
forward price to adjust so that neither of the two arbitrage opportunities we have
considered exists. This means that the relationship in equation (5.1) must hold.
Business Snapshot 5.1
Kidder Peabody’s Embarrassing Mistake
Investment banks have developed a way of creating a zero-coupon bond, called a
strip, from a coupon-bearing Treasury bond by selling each of the cash ﬂows under-
lying the coupon-bearing bond as a separate security. Joseph Jett, a trader working
for Kidder Peabody, had a relatively simple trading strategy. He would buy strips and
sell them in the forward market. As equation (5.1) shows, the forward price of a
security providing no income is always higher than the spot price. Suppose, for
example, that the 3-month interest rate is 4% per annum and the spot price of a strip
is $70. The 3-month forward price of the strip is 70e0:043=12 ¼ $70:70.
Kidder Peabody’s computer system reported a proﬁt on each of Jett’s trades equal to
the excess of the forward price over the spot price ($0.70 in our example). In fact, this
proﬁt was nothing more than the cost of ﬁnancing the purchase of the strip. But, by
rolling his contracts forward, Jett was able to prevent this cost from accruing to him.
The result was that the system reported a proﬁt of $100 million on Jett’s trading
(and Jett received a big bonus) when in fact there was a loss in the region of
$350 million. This shows that even large ﬁnancial institutions can get relatively
simple things wrong!

5.5
KNOWN INCOME
In this section we consider a forward contract on an investment asset that will provide a
perfectly predictable cash income to the holder. Examples are stocks paying known
dividends and coupon-bearing bonds. We adopt the same approach as in the previous
section. We ﬁrst look at a numerical example and then review the formal arguments.
Consider a long forward contract to purchase a coupon-bearing bond whose current
price is $900. We will suppose that the forward contract matures in 9 months. We will
also suppose that a coupon payment of $40 is expected after 4 months. We assume that
the 4-month and 9-month risk-free interest rates (continuously compounded) are,
respectively, 3% and 4% per annum.
Suppose ﬁrst that the forward price is relatively high at $910. An arbitrageur can
borrow $900 to buy the bond and short a forward contract. The coupon payment has a
present value of 40e0:034=12 ¼ $39:60. Of the $900, $39.60 is therefore borrowed at
3% per annum for 4 months so that it can be repaid with the coupon payment. The
remaining $860.40 is borrowed at 4% per annum for 9 months. The amount owing at
the end of the 9-month period is 860:40e0:040:75 ¼ $886:60. A sum of $910 is received
for the bond under the terms of the forward contract. The arbitrageur therefore makes
a net proﬁt of
910:00  886:60 ¼ $23:40
Suppose next that the forward price is relatively low at $870. An investor can short the
bond and enter into a long forward contract. Of the $900 realized from shorting the
bond, $39.60 is invested for 4 months at 3% per annum so that it grows into an amount
suﬃcient to pay the coupon on the bond. The remaining $860.40 is invested for
9 months at 4% per annum and grows to $886.60. Under the terms of the forward
contract, $870 is paid to buy the bond and the short position is closed out. The investor
therefore gains
886:60  870 ¼ $16:60
The two strategies we have considered are summarized in Table 5.3.3 The ﬁrst strategy in
Table 5.3 produces a proﬁt when the forward price is greater than $886.60, whereas the
second strategy produces a proﬁt when the forward price is less than $886.60. It follows
that if there are no arbitrage opportunities then the forward price must be $886.60.
A Generalization
We can generalize from this example to argue that, when an investment asset will
provide income with a present value of I during the life of a forward contract, we have
F0 ¼ ðS0  IÞerT
ð5:2Þ
In our example, S0 ¼ 900:00, I ¼ 40e0:034=12 ¼ 39:60, r ¼ 0:04, and T ¼ 0:75, so that
F0 ¼ ð900:00  39:60Þe0:040:75 ¼ $886:60
3 If shorting the bond is not possible, investors who already own the bond will sell it and buy a forward
contract on the bond increasing the value of their position by $16.60. This is similar to the strategy we
described for the asset in the previous section.
132
CHAPTER 5

This is in agreement with our earlier calculation. Equation (5.2) applies to any investment
asset that provides a known cash income.
If F0 > ðS0  IÞerT, an arbitrageur can lock in a proﬁt by buying the asset and
shorting a forward contract on the asset; if F0 < ðS0  IÞerT, an arbitrageur can lock
in a proﬁt by shorting the asset and taking a long position in a forward contract. If
short sales are not possible, investors who own the asset will ﬁnd it proﬁtable to sell the
asset and enter into long forward contracts.4
Example 5.2
Consider a 10-month forward contract on a stock when the stock price is $50. We
assume that the risk-free rate of interest (continuously compounded) is 8% per
annum for all maturities. We also assume that dividends of $0.75 per share are
expected after 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The present value of the
dividends, I, is
I ¼ 0:75e0:083=12 þ 0:75e0:086=12 þ 0:75e0:089=12 ¼ 2:162
The variable T is 10 months, so that the forward price, F0, from equation (5.2), is
given by
F0 ¼ ð50  2:162Þe0:0810=12 ¼ $51:14
Table 5.3
Arbitrage opportunities when 9-month forward price is out of line with
spot price for asset providing known cash income. (Asset price ¼ $900; income of
$40 occurs at 4 months; 4-month and 9-month rates are, respectively, 3% and 4%
per annum.)
Forward price ¼ $910
Forward price ¼ $870

Proﬁt realized ¼ $23.40
Proﬁt realized ¼ $16.60
4 For another way of seeing that equation (5.2) is correct, consider the following strategy: buy one unit of the
asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for F0 at time T. This costs S0 and is certain to lead to a
cash inﬂow of F0 at time T and an income with a present value of I. The initial outﬂow is S0. The present
value of the inﬂows is I þ F0erT. Hence, S0 ¼ I þ F0erT, or equivalently F0 ¼ ðS0  IÞerT.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices
133

If the forward price were less than this, an arbitrageur would short the stock and
buy forward contracts. If the forward price were greater than this, an arbitrageur
would short forward contracts and buy the stock in the spot market.
5.6
KNOWN YIELD
We now consider the situation where the asset underlying a forward contract provides a
known yield rather than a known cash income. This means that the income is known
when expressed as a percentage of the asset’s price at the time the income is paid.
Suppose that an asset is expected to provide a yield of 5% per annum. This could mean
that income is paid once a year and is equal to 5% of the asset price at the time it is paid,
in which case the yield would be 5% with annual compounding. Alternatively, it could
mean that income is paid twice a year and is equal to 2.5% of the asset price at the time
it is paid, in which case the yield would be 5% per annum with semiannual compound-
ing. In Section 4.2 we explained that we will normally measure interest rates with
continuous compounding. Similarly, we will normally measure yields with continuous
compounding. Formulas for translating a yield measured with one compounding
frequency to a yield measured with another compounding frequency are the same as
those given for interest rates in Section 4.2.
Deﬁne q as the average yield per annum on an asset during the life of a forward
contract with continuous compounding. It can be shown (see Problem 5.20) that
F0 ¼ S0eðrqÞT
ð5:3Þ
Example 5.3
Consider a 6-month forward contract on an asset that is expected to provide
income equal to 2% of the asset price once during a 6-month period. The risk-
free rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is 10% per annum. The asset
price is $25. In this case, S0 ¼ 25, r ¼ 0:10, and T ¼ 0:5. The yield is 4% per
annum with semiannual compounding. From equation (4.3), this is 3.96% per
annum with continuous compounding. It follows that q ¼ 0:0396, so that from
equation (5.3) the forward price, F0, is given by
F0 ¼ 25eð0:100:0396Þ0:5 ¼ $25:77
5.7
VALUING FORWARD CONTRACTS
The value of a forward contract at the time it is ﬁrst entered into is close to zero. At a
later stage, it may prove to have a positive or negative value. It is important for banks
and other ﬁnancial institutions to value the contract each day. (This is referred to as
marking to market the contract.) Using the notation introduced earlier, we suppose K is
the delivery price for a contract that was negotiated some time ago, the delivery date is
T years from today, and r is the T-year risk-free interest rate. The variable F0 is the
forward price that would be applicable if we negotiated the contract today. In addition,
we deﬁne f to be the value of forward contract today.
It is important to be clear about the meaning of the variables F0, K, and f. At the
beginning of the life of the forward contract, the delivery price, K, is set equal to the
134
CHAPTER 5

forward price at that time and the value of the contract, f, is 0. As time passes, K stays
the same (because it is part of the deﬁnition of the contract), but the forward price
changes and the value of the contract becomes either positive or negative.
A general result, applicable to all long forward contracts (both those on investment
assets and those on consumption assets), is
f ¼ ðF0  KÞerT
ð5:4Þ
To see why equation (5.4) is correct, we use an argument analogous to the one we used
for forward rate agreements in Section 4.7. We form a portfolio today consisting of
(a) a forward contract to buy the underlying asset for K at time T and (b) a forward
contract to sell the asset for F0 at time T. The payoﬀfrom the portfolio at time T is
ST  K from the ﬁrst contract and F0  ST from the second contract. The total payoﬀis
F0  K and is known for certain today. The portfolio is therefore a risk-free investment
and its value today is the payoﬀat time T discounted at the risk-free rate or
ðF0  KÞerT. The value of the forward contract to sell the asset for F0 is worth zero
because F0 is the forward price that applies to a forward contract entered into today. It
follows that the value of a (long) forward contract to buy an asset for K at time T must
be ðF0  KÞerT. Similarly, the value of a (short) forward contract to sell the asset for K
at time T is ðK  F0ÞerT.
Example 5.4
A long forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock was entered into some
time ago. It currently has 6 months to maturity. The risk-free rate of interest (with
continuous compounding) is 10% per annum, the stock price is $25, and the
delivery price is $24. In this case, S0 ¼ 25, r ¼ 0:10, T ¼ 0:5, and K ¼ 24. From
equation (5.1), the 6-month forward price, F0, is given by
F0 ¼ 25e0:10:5 ¼ $26:28
From equation (5.4), the value of the forward contract is
f ¼ ð26:28  24Þe0:10:5 ¼ $2:17
Equation (5.4) shows that we can value a long forward contract on an asset by making
the assumption that the price of the asset at the maturity of the forward contract equals
the forward price F0. To see this, note that when we make that assumption, a long
forward contract provides a payoﬀat time T of F0  K. This has a present value of
ðF0  KÞerT, which is the value of f in equation (5.4). Similarly, we can value a short
forward contract on the asset by assuming that the current forward price of the asset is
realized. These results are analogous to the result in Section 4.7 that we can value a
forward rate agreement on the assumption that forward rates are realized.
Using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.1) gives the following expression
for the value of a forward contract on an investment asset that provides no income
f ¼ S0  KerT
ð5:5Þ
Similarly, using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.2) gives the following
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices
135

expression for the value of a long forward contract on an investment asset that provides
a known income with present value I:
f ¼ S0  I  KerT
ð5:6Þ
Finally, using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.3) gives the following
expression for the value of a long forward contract on an investment asset that provides
a known yield at rate q:
f ¼ S0eqT  KerT
ð5:7Þ
When a futures price changes, the gain or loss on a futures contract is calculated as the
change in the futures price multiplied by the size of the position. This gain is realized
almost immediately because futures contracts are settled daily. Equation (5.4) shows
that, when a forward price changes, the gain or loss is the present value of the change in
the forward price multiplied by the size of the position. The diﬀerence between the gain/
loss on forward and futures contracts can cause confusion on a foreign exchange trading
desk (see Business Snapshot 5.2).
5.8
ARE FORWARD PRICES AND FUTURES PRICES EQUAL?
Technical Note 24 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes provides an
arbitrage argument to show that, when the short-term risk-free interest rate is constant,
Business Snapshot 5.2
A Systems Error?
A foreign exchange trader working for a bank enters into a long forward contract to
buy 1 million pounds sterling at an exchange rate of 1.5000 in 3 months. At the same
time, another trader on the next desk takes a long position in 16 contracts for
3-month futures on sterling. The futures price is 1.5000 and each contract is on
62,500 pounds. The positions taken by the forward and futures traders are therefore
the same. Within minutes of the positions being taken, the forward and the futures
prices both increase to 1.5040. The bank’s systems show that the futures trader has
made a proﬁt of $4,000, while the forward trader has made a proﬁt of only $3,900.
The forward trader immediately calls the bank’s systems department to complain.
Does the forward trader have a valid complaint?
The answer is no! The daily settlement of futures contracts ensures that the futures
trader realizes an almost immediate proﬁt corresponding to the increase in the futures
price. If the forward trader closed out the position by entering into a short contract
at 1.5040, the forward trader would have contracted to buy 1 million pounds
at 1.5000 in 3 months and sell 1 million pounds at 1.5040 in 3 months. This would
lead to a $4,000 proﬁt—but in 3 months, not today. The forward trader’s proﬁt is the
present value of $4,000. This is consistent with equation (5.4).
The forward trader can gain some consolation from the fact that gains and losses
are treated symmetrically. If the forward/futures prices dropped to 1.4960 instead of
rising to 1.5040, then the futures trader would take a loss of $4,000 while the forward
trader would take a loss of only $3,900.
136
CHAPTER 5

the forward price for a contract with a certain delivery date is in theory the same as the
futures price for a contract with that delivery date. The argument can be extended to
cover situations where the interest rate is a known function of time.
When interest rates vary unpredictably (as they do in the real world), forward and
futures prices are in theory no longer the same. We can get a sense of the nature of the
relationship by considering the situation where the price of the underlying asset, S, is
strongly positively correlated with interest rates. When S increases, an investor who
holds a long futures position makes an immediate gain because of the daily settlement
procedure. The positive correlation indicates that it is likely that interest rates have also
increased. The gain will therefore tend to be invested at a higher than average rate of
interest. Similarly, when S decreases, the investor will incur an immediate loss. This loss
will tend to be ﬁnanced at a lower than average rate of interest. An investor holding a
forward contract rather than a futures contract is not aﬀected in this way by interest rate
movements. It follows that a long futures contract will be slightly more attractive than a
similar long forward contract. Hence, when S is strongly positively correlated with
interest rates, futures prices will tend to be slightly higher than forward prices. When S
is strongly negatively correlated with interest rates, a similar argument shows that
forward prices will tend to be slightly higher than futures prices.
The theoretical diﬀerences between forward and futures prices for contracts that last
only a few months are in most circumstances suﬃciently small to be ignored. In
practice, there are a number of factors not reﬂected in theoretical models that may
cause forward and futures prices to be diﬀerent. These include taxes, transactions costs,
and margin requirements. The risk that the counterparty will default may be less in the
case of a futures contract because of the role of the exchange clearing house. Also, in
some instances, futures contracts are more liquid and easier to trade than forward
contracts. Despite all these points, for most purposes it is reasonable to assume that
forward and futures prices are the same. This is the assumption we will usually make in
this book. We will use the symbol F0 to represent both the futures price and the forward
price of an asset today.
One exception to the rule that futures and forward contracts can be assumed to be
the same concerns Eurodollar futures. This will be discussed in Section 6.3.
5.9
FUTURES PRICES OF STOCK INDICES
We introduced futures on stock indices in Section 3.5 and showed how a stock index
futures contract is a useful tool in managing equity portfolios. Table 3.3 shows futures
prices for a number of diﬀerent indices. We are now in a position to consider how index
futures prices are determined.
A stock index can usually be regarded as the price of an investment asset that pays
dividends.5 The investment asset is the portfolio of stocks underlying the index, and the
dividends paid by the investment asset are the dividends that would be received by the
holder of this portfolio. It is usually assumed that the dividends provide a known yield
rather than a known cash income. If q is the dividend yield rate, equation (5.3) gives the
futures price, F0, as
F0 ¼ S0eðrqÞT
ð5:8Þ
5 Occasionally this is not the case: see Business Snapshot 5.3.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices
137

This shows that the futures price increases at rate r  q with the maturity of the futures
contract. In Table 3.3, the December futures settlement price of the S&P 500 is about
0.75% less than the June settlement price. This indicates that, on May 14, 2013, the
short-term risk-free rate r was less than the dividend yield q by about 1.5% per year.
Example 5.5
Consider a 3-month futures contract on an index. Suppose that the stocks under-
lying the index provide a dividend yield of 1% per annum, that the current value
of the index is 1,300, and that the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate
is 5% per annum. In this case, r ¼ 0:05, S0 ¼ 1,300, T ¼ 0:25, and q ¼ 0:01.
Hence, the futures price, F0, is given by
F0 ¼ 1,300eð0:050:01Þ0:25 ¼ $1,313:07
In practice, the dividend yield on the portfolio underlying an index varies week by week
throughout the year. For example, a large proportion of the dividends on the NYSE
stocks are paid in the ﬁrst week of February, May, August, and November each year.
The chosen value of q should represent the average annualized dividend yield during the
life of the contract. The dividends used for estimating q should be those for which the
ex-dividend date is during the life of the futures contract.
Index Arbitrage
If F0 > S0eðrqÞT, proﬁts can be made by buying the stocks underlying the index at the
spot price (i.e., for immediate delivery) and shorting futures contracts. If F0 < S0eðrqÞT,
proﬁts can be made by doing the reverse—that is, shorting or selling the stocks
underlying the index and taking a long position in futures contracts. These strategies
are known as index arbitrage. When F0 < S0eðrqÞT, index arbitrage is often done by a
pension fund that owns an indexed portfolio of stocks. When F0 > S0eðrqÞT, it might be
Business Snapshot 5.3
The CME Nikkei 225 Futures Contract
The arguments in this chapter on how index futures prices are determined require that
the index be the value of an investment asset. This means that it must be the value of a
portfolio of assets that can be traded. The asset underlying the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange’s futures contract on the Nikkei 225 Index does not qualify, and the reason
why is quite subtle. Suppose S is the value of the Nikkei 225 Index. This is the value of
a portfolio of 225 Japanese stocks measured in yen. The variable underlying the CME
futures contract on the Nikkei 225 has a dollar value of 5S. In other words, the futures
contract takes a variable that is measured in yen and treats it as though it is dollars.
We cannot invest in a portfolio whose value will always be 5S dollars. The best we
can do is to invest in one that is always worth 5S yen or in one that is always worth
5QS dollars, where Q is the dollar value of 1 yen. The variable 5S dollars is not,
therefore, the price of an investment asset and equation (5.8) does not apply.
CME’s Nikkei 225 futures contract is an example of a quanto. A quanto is a
derivative where the underlying asset is measured in one currency and the payoﬀis in
another currency. Quantos will be discussed further in Chapter 30.

CHAPTER 5

done by a bank or a corporation holding short-term money market investments. For
indices involving many stocks, index arbitrage is sometimes accomplished by trading a
relatively small representative sample of stocks whose movements closely mirror those
of the index. Usually index arbitrage is implemented through program trading. This
involves using a computer system to generate the trades.
Most of the time the activities of arbitrageurs ensure that equation (5.8) holds, but
occasionally arbitrage is impossible and the futures price does get out of line with the
spot price (see Business Snapshot 5.4).
5.10
FORWARD AND FUTURES CONTRACTS ON CURRENCIES
We now move on to consider forward and futures foreign currency contracts from the
perspective of a US investor. The underlying asset is one unit of the foreign currency.
We will therefore deﬁne the variable S0 as the current spot price in US dollars of one
unit of the foreign currency and F0 as the forward or futures price in US dollars of one
unit of the foreign currency. This is consistent with the way we have deﬁned S0 and F0
for other assets underlying forward and futures contracts. However, as mentioned in
Section 2.11, it does not necessarily correspond to the way spot and forward exchange
rates are quoted. For major exchange rates other than the British pound, euro,
Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, a spot or forward exchange rate is normally
quoted as the number of units of the currency that are equivalent to one US dollar.
Business Snapshot 5.4
Index Arbitrage in October 1987
To do index arbitrage, a trader must be able to trade both the index futures contract
and the portfolio of stocks underlying the index very quickly at the prices quoted in
the market. In normal market conditions this is possible using program trading, and
the relationship in equation (5.8) holds well. Examples of days when the market was
anything but normal are October 19 and 20 of 1987. On what is termed ‘‘Black
Monday,’’ October 19, 1987, the market fell by more than 20%, and the 604 million
shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange easily exceeded all previous records.
The exchange’s systems were overloaded, and orders placed to buy or sell shares on
that day could be delayed by up to two hours before being executed.
For most of October 19, 1987, futures prices were at a signiﬁcant discount to the
underlying index. For example, at the close of trading the S&P 500 Index was at
225.06 (down 57.88 on the day), whereas the futures price for December delivery on
the S&P 500 was 201.50 (down 80.75 on the day). This was largely because the delays
in processing orders made index arbitrage impossible. On the next day, Tuesday,
October 20, 1987, the New York Stock Exchange placed temporary restrictions on
the way in which program trading could be done. This also made index arbitrage very
diﬃcult and the breakdown of the traditional linkage between stock indices and stock
index futures continued. At one point the futures price for the December contract was
18% less than the S&P 500 Index. However, after a few days the market returned to
normal, and the activities of arbitrageurs ensured that equation (5.8) governed the
relationship between futures and spot prices of indices.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices
139

A foreign currency has the property that the holder of the currency can earn interest
at the risk-free interest rate prevailing in the foreign country. For example, the holder
can invest the currency in a foreign-denominated bond. We deﬁne rf as the value of the
foreign risk-free interest rate when money is invested for time T. The variable r is the
risk-free rate when money is invested for this period of time in US dollars.
The relationship between F0 and S0 is
F0 ¼ S0eðrrf ÞT
ð5:9Þ
This is the well-known interest rate parity relationship from international ﬁnance. The
reason it is true is illustrated in Figure 5.1. Suppose that an individual starts with
1,000 units of the foreign currency. There are two ways it can be converted to dollars at
time T. One is by investing it for T years at rf and entering into a forward contract to
sell the proceeds for dollars at time T. This generates 1,000erf TF0 dollars. The other is
by exchanging the foreign currency for dollars in the spot market and investing the
proceeds for T years at rate r. This generates 1,000S0erT dollars. In the absence of
arbitrage opportunities, the two strategies must give the same result. Hence,
1,000erf TF0 ¼ 1,000S0erT
so that
F0 ¼ S0eðrrf ÞT
Example 5.6
Suppose that the 2-year interest rates in Australia and the United States are 3%
and 1%, respectively, and the spot exchange rate is 0.9800 USD per AUD. From

CHAPTER 5

Suppose ﬁrst that the 2-year forward exchange rate is less than this, say 0.9300.
An arbitrageur can:
1. Borrow 1,000 AUD at 3% per annum for 2 years, convert to 980 USD and
invest the USD at 1% (both rates are continuously compounded).
2. Enter into a forward contract to buy 1,061.84 AUD for 1,061:84  0:93 ¼
987:51 USD.
The 980 USD that are invested at 1% grow to 980e0:012 ¼ 999:80 USD in
2 years. Of this, 987.51 USD are used to purchase 1,061.84 AUD under the terms
of the forward contract. This is exactly enough to repay principal and interest on
the 1,000 AUD that are borrowed (1,000e0:032 ¼ 1; 061:84). The strategy there-
fore gives rise to a riskless proﬁt of 999:80  987:51 ¼ 12:29 USD. (If this does
not sound very exciting, consider following a similar strategy where you borrow
100 million AUD!)
Suppose next that the 2-year forward rate is 0.9600 (greater than the 0.9416
value given by equation (5.9)). An arbitrageur can:
1. Borrow 1,000 USD at 1% per annum for 2 years, convert to 1,000=0:9800 ¼
1,020:41 AUD, and invest the AUD at 3%.
2. Enter into a forward contract to sell 1,083.51 AUD for 1,083:51  0:96 ¼
1,040:17 USD.
The 1,020.41 AUD
that are invested
at 3% grow to 1,020:41e0:032 ¼
1,083:51 AUD in 2 years. The forward contract has the eﬀect of converting this
to 1,040.17 USD. The amount needed to payoﬀthe USD borrowings is
1,000e0:012 ¼ 1,020:20 USD. The strategy therefore gives rise to a riskless proﬁt
of 1,040:17  1,020:20 ¼ 19:97 USD.
Table 5.4 shows currency futures quotes on May 14, 2013. The quotes are US dollars
per unit of the foreign currency. (In the case of the Japanese yen, the quote is
US dollars per 100 yen.) This is the usual quotation convention for futures contracts.
Equation (5.9) applies with r equal to the US risk-free rate and rf equal to the foreign
risk-free rate.
On May 14, 2013, short-term interest rates on the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro
were lower than the short-term interest rate on the US dollar. This corresponds to the
r > rf situation and explains why futures prices for these currencies increase with
maturity in Table 5.4. For the Australian dollar, British pound, and Canadian dollar,
short-term interest rates were higher than in the United States. This corresponds to the
rf > r situation and explains why the futures settlement prices of these currencies
decrease with maturity.
Example 5.7
In Table 5.4, the September settlement price for the Australian dollar is about
0.6% lower than the June settlement price. This indicates that the futures prices
are decreasing at about 2.4% per year with maturity. From equation (5.9) this is
an estimate of the amount by which short-term Australian interest rates exceeded
short-term US interest rates on May 14, 2013.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices

A Foreign Currency as an Asset Providing a Known Yield
Equation (5.9) is identical to equation (5.3) with q replaced by rf. This is not a
coincidence. A foreign currency can be regarded as an investment asset paying a known
yield. The yield is the risk-free rate of interest in the foreign currency.
To understand this, we note that the value of interest paid in a foreign currency
depends on the value of the foreign currency. Suppose that the interest rate on British
pounds is 5% per annum. To a US investor the British pound provides an income equal
to 5% of the value of the British pound per annum. In other words it is an asset that
provides a yield of 5% per annum.
5.11
FUTURES ON COMMODITIES
We now move on to consider futures contracts on commodities. First we look at the
futures prices of commodities that are investment assets such as gold and silver.6 We
then go on to examine the futures prices of consumption assets.

6 Recall that, for an asset to be an investment asset, it need not be held solely for investment purposes. What
is required is that some individuals hold it for investment purposes and that these individuals be prepared to
sell their holdings and go long forward contracts, if the latter look more attractive. This explains why silver,
although it has industrial uses, is an investment asset.
142
CHAPTER 5

Income and Storage Costs
As explained in Business Snapshot 3.1, the hedging strategies of gold producers leads to
a requirement on the part of investment banks to borrow gold. Gold owners such as
central banks charge interest in the form of what is known as the gold lease rate when
they lend gold. The same is true of silver. Gold and silver can therefore provide income
to the holder. Like other commodities they also have storage costs.
Equation (5.1) shows that, in the absence of storage costs and income, the forward
price of a commodity that is an investment asset is given by
F0 ¼ S0erT
ð5:10Þ
Storage costs can be treated as negative income. If U is the present value of all the
storage costs, net of income, during the life of a forward contract, it follows from
equation (5.2) that
F0 ¼ ðS0 þ UÞerT
ð5:11Þ
Example 5.8
Consider a 1-year futures contract on an investment asset that provides no income.
It costs $2 per unit to store the asset, with the payment being made at the end of
the year. Assume that the spot price is $450 per unit and the risk-free rate is 7%
per annum for all maturities. This corresponds to r ¼ 0:07, S0 ¼ 450, T ¼ 1, and
U ¼ 2e0:071 ¼ 1:865
From equation (5.11), the theoretical futures price, F0, is given by
F0 ¼ ð450 þ 1:865Þe0:071 ¼ $484:63
If the actual futures price is greater than 484.63, an arbitrageur can buy the asset
and short 1-year futures contracts to lock in a proﬁt. If the actual futures price is
less than 484.63, an investor who already owns the asset can improve the return by
selling the asset and buying futures contracts.
If the storage costs (net of income) incurred at any time are proportional to the price of
the commodity, they can be treated as negative yield. In this case, from equation (5.3),
F0 ¼ S0eðrþuÞT
ð5:12Þ
where u denotes the storage costs per annum as a proportion of the spot price net of
any yield earned on the asset.
Consumption Commodities
Commodities that are consumption assets rather than investment assets usually
provide no income, but can be subject to signiﬁcant storage costs. We now review
the arbitrage strategies used to determine futures prices from spot prices carefully.7
7 For some commodities the spot price depends on the delivery location. We assume that the delivery
location for spot and futures are the same.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices
143

Suppose that, instead of equation (5.11), we have
F0 > ðS0 þ UÞerT
ð5:13Þ
To take advantage of this opportunity, an arbitrageur can implement the following
strategy:
1. Borrow an amount S0 þ U at the risk-free rate and use it to purchase one unit of
the commodity and to pay storage costs.
2. Short a futures contract on one unit of the commodity.
If we regard the futures contract as a forward contract, so that there is no daily
settlement, this strategy leads to a proﬁt of F0  ðS0 þ UÞerT at time T. There is no
problem in implementing the strategy for any commodity. However, as arbitrageurs do
so, there will be a tendency for S0 to increase and F0 to decrease until equation (5.13) is
no longer true. We conclude that equation (5.13) cannot hold for any signiﬁcant length
of time.
Suppose next that
F0 < ðS0 þ UÞerT
ð5:14Þ
When the commodity is an investment asset, we can argue that many investors hold the
commodity solely for investment. When they observe the inequality in equation (5.14),
they will ﬁnd it proﬁtable to do the following:
1. Sell the commodity, save the storage costs, and invest the proceeds at the risk-free
interest rate.
2. Take a long position in a futures contract.
The result is a riskless proﬁt at maturity of ðS0 þ UÞerT  F0 relative to the position
the investors would have been in if they had held the commodity. It follows that
equation (5.14) cannot hold for long. Because neither equation (5.13) nor (5.14) can
hold for long, we must have F0 ¼ ðS0 þ UÞerT.
This argument cannot be used for a commodity that is a consumption asset rather
than an investment asset. Individuals and companies who own a consumption
commodity usually plan to use it in some way. They are reluctant to sell the
commodity in the spot market and buy forward or futures contracts, because forward
and futures contracts cannot be used in a manufacturing process or consumed in some
other way. There is therefore nothing to stop equation (5.14) from holding, and all we
can assert for a consumption commodity is
F0 6 ðS0 þ UÞerT
ð5:15Þ
If storage costs are expressed as a proportion u of the spot price, the equivalent result is
F0 6 S0eðrþuÞT
ð5:16Þ
Convenience Yields
We do not necessarily have equality in equations (5.15) and (5.16) because users of a
consumption commodity may feel that ownership of the physical commodity provides
beneﬁts that are not obtained by holders of futures contracts. For example, an oil
144
CHAPTER 5

reﬁner is unlikely to regard a futures contract on crude oil in the same way as crude oil
held in inventory. The crude oil in inventory can be an input to the reﬁning process,
whereas a futures contract cannot be used for this purpose. In general, ownership of the
physical asset enables a manufacturer to keep a production process running and
perhaps proﬁt from temporary local shortages. A futures contract does not do the
same. The beneﬁts from holding the physical asset are sometimes referred to as the
convenience yield provided by the commodity. If the dollar amount of storage costs is
known and has a present value U, then the convenience yield y is deﬁned such that
F0eyT ¼ ðS0 þ UÞerT
If the storage costs per unit are a constant proportion, u, of the spot price, then y is
deﬁned so that
F0eyT ¼ S0eðrþuÞT
or
F0 ¼ S0eðrþuyÞT
ð5:17Þ
The convenience yield simply measures the extent to which the left-hand side is less than
the right-hand side in equation (5.15) or (5.16). For investment assets the convenience
yield must be zero; otherwise, there are arbitrage opportunities. Table 2.2 in Chapter 2
shows that, on May 14, 2013, the futures price of soybeans decreased as the maturity of
the contract increased from July 2013 to November 2013. This pattern suggests that the
convenience yield, y, is greater than r þ u during this period.
The convenience yield reﬂects the market’s expectations concerning the future avail-
ability of the commodity. The greater the possibility that shortages will occur, the
higher the convenience yield. If users of the commodity have high inventories, there is
very little chance of shortages in the near future and the convenience yield tends to be
low. If inventories are low, shortages are more likely and the convenience yield is usually
higher.
5.12
THE COST OF CARRY
The relationship between futures prices and spot prices can be summarized in terms of
the cost of carry. This measures the storage cost plus the interest that is paid to ﬁnance
the asset less the income earned on the asset. For a non-dividend-paying stock, the
cost of carry is r, because there are no storage costs and no income is earned; for a
stock index, it is r  q, because income is earned at rate q on the asset. For a currency,
it is r  rf; for a commodity that provides income at rate q and requires storage costs
at rate u, it is r  q þ u; and so on.
Deﬁne the cost of carry as c. For an investment asset, the futures price is
F0 ¼ S0ecT
ð5:18Þ
For a consumption asset, it is
F0 ¼ S0eðcyÞT
ð5:19Þ
where y is the convenience yield.

145

5.13
DELIVERY OPTIONS
Whereas a forward contract normally speciﬁes that delivery is to take place on a
particular day, a futures contract often allows the party with the short position to
choose to deliver at any time during a certain period. (Typically the party has to give a
few days’ notice of its intention to deliver.) The choice introduces a complication into
the determination of futures prices. Should the maturity of the futures contract be
assumed to be the beginning, middle, or end of the delivery period? Even though most
futures contracts are closed out prior to maturity, it is important to know when delivery
would have taken place in order to calculate the theoretical futures price.
If the futures price is an increasing function of the time to maturity, it can be seen
from equation (5.19) that c > y, so that the beneﬁts from holding the asset (including
convenience yield and net of storage costs) are less than the risk-free rate. It is usually
optimal in such a case for the party with the short position to deliver as early as
possible, because the interest earned on the cash received outweighs the beneﬁts of
holding the asset. As a rule, futures prices in these circumstances should be calculated
on the basis that delivery will take place at the beginning of the delivery period. If
futures prices are decreasing as time to maturity increases (c < y), the reverse is true. It
is then usually optimal for the party with the short position to deliver as late as
possible, and futures prices should, as a rule, be calculated on this assumption.
5.14
FUTURES PRICES AND EXPECTED FUTURE SPOT PRICES
We refer to the market’s average opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be at
a certain future time as the expected spot price of the asset at that time. Suppose that it
is now June and the September futures price of corn is 350 cents. It is interesting to ask
what the expected spot price of corn in September is. Is it less than 350 cents, greater
than 350 cents, or exactly equal to 350 cents? As illustrated in Figure 2.1, the futures
price converges to the spot price at maturity. If the expected spot price is less than
350 cents, the market must be expecting the September futures price to decline, so that
traders with short positions gain and traders with long positions lose. If the expected
spot price is greater than 350 cents, the reverse must be true. The market must be
expecting the September futures price to increase, so that traders with long positions
gain while those with short positions lose.
Keynes and Hicks
Economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that, if hedgers tend to hold
short positions and speculators tend to hold long positions, the futures price of an asset
will be below the expected spot price.8 This is because speculators require compensation
for the risks they are bearing. They will trade only if they can expect to make money on
average. Hedgers will lose money on average, but they are likely to be prepared to
accept this because the futures contract reduces their risks. If hedgers tend to hold long
positions while speculators hold short positions, Keynes and Hicks argued that the
futures price will be above the expected spot price for a similar reason.

146
CHAPTER 5

Risk and Return
The modern approach to explaining the relationship between futures prices and
expected spot prices is based on the relationship between risk and expected return in
the economy. In general, the higher the risk of an investment, the higher the expected
return demanded by an investor. The capital asset pricing model, which is explained in
the appendix to Chapter 3, shows that there are two types of risk in the economy:
systematic and nonsystematic. Nonsystematic risk should not be important to an
investor. It can be almost completely eliminated by holding a well-diversiﬁed portfolio.
An investor should not therefore require a higher expected return for bearing non-
systematic risk. Systematic risk, in contrast, cannot be diversiﬁed away. It arises from a
correlation between returns from the investment and returns from the whole stock
market. An investor generally requires a higher expected return than the risk-free
interest rate for bearing positive amounts of systematic risk. Also, an investor is
prepared to accept a lower expected return than the risk-free interest rate when the
systematic risk in an investment is negative.
The Risk in a Futures Position
Let us consider a speculator who takes a long position in a futures contract that lasts for
T years in the hope that the spot price of the asset will be above the futures price at the
end of the life of the futures contract. We ignore daily settlement and assume that the
futures contract can be treated as a forward contract. We suppose that the speculator
puts the present value of the futures price into a risk-free investment while simul-
taneously taking a long futures position. The proceeds of the risk-free investment are
used to buy the asset on the delivery date. The asset is then immediately sold for its
market price. The cash ﬂows to the speculator are as follows:
Today: F0erT
End of futures contract: þST
where F0 is the futures price today, ST is the price of the asset at time T at the end of the
futures contract, and r is the risk-free return on funds invested for time T.
How do we value this investment? The discount rate we should use for the expected
cash ﬂow at time T equals an investor’s required return on the investment. Suppose that
k is an investor’s required return for this investment. The present value of this
investment is
F0erT þ EðSTÞekT
where E denotes expected value. We can assume that all investments in securities
markets are priced so that they have zero net present value. This means that
F0erT þ EðSTÞekT ¼ 0
or
F0 ¼ EðSTÞeðrkÞT
ð5:20Þ
As we have just discussed, the returns investors require on an investment depend on its
systematic risk. The investment we have been considering is in essence an investment in
the asset underlying the futures contract. If the returns from this asset are uncorrelated

147

with the stock market, the correct discount rate to use is the risk-free rate r, so we
should set k ¼ r. Equation (5.20) then gives
F0 ¼ EðSTÞ
This shows that the futures price is an unbiased estimate of the expected future spot
price when the return from the underlying asset is uncorrelated with the stock
market.
If the return from the asset is positively correlated with the stock market, k > r and
equation (5.20) leads to F0 < EðSTÞ. This shows that, when the asset underlying the
futures contract has positive systematic risk, we should expect the futures price to
understate the expected future spot price. An example of an asset that has positive
systematic risk is a stock index. The expected return of investors on the stocks underlying
an index is generally more than the risk-free rate, r. The dividends provide a return of q.
The expected increase in the index must therefore be more than r  q. Equation (5.8) is
therefore consistent with the prediction that the futures price understates the expected
future stock price for a stock index.
If the return from the asset is negatively correlated with the stock market, k < r and
equation (5.20) gives F0 > EðSTÞ. This shows that, when the asset underlying the futures
contract has negative systematic risk, we should expect the futures price to overstate the
expected future spot price.
These results are summarized in Table 5.5.
Normal Backwardation and Contango
When the futures price is below the expected future spot price, the situation is known as
normal backwardation; and when the futures price is above the expected future spot
price, the situation is known as contango. However, it should be noted that sometimes
these terms are used to refer to whether the futures price is below or above the current
spot price, rather than the expected future spot price.
SUMMARY
For most purposes, the futures price of a contract with a certain delivery date can be
considered to be the same as the forward price for a contract with the same delivery
date. It can be shown that in theory the two should be exactly the same when interest
rates are perfectly predictable.

CHAPTER 5

For the purposes of understanding futures (or forward) prices, it is convenient to
divide futures contracts into two categories: those in which the underlying asset is held
for investment by at least some traders and those in which the underlying asset is held
primarily for consumption purposes.
In the case of investment assets, we have considered three diﬀerent situations:
1. The asset provides no income.
2. The asset provides a known dollar income.
3. The asset provides a known yield.
The results are summarized in Table 5.6. They enable futures prices to be obtained for
contracts on stock indices, currencies, gold, and silver. Storage costs can be treated as
negative income.
In the case of consumption assets, it is not possible to obtain the futures price as a
function of the spot price and other observable variables. Here the parameter known as
the asset’s convenience yield becomes important. It measures the extent to which users
of the commodity feel that ownership of the physical asset provides beneﬁts that are not
obtained by the holders of the futures contract. These beneﬁts may include the ability
to proﬁt from temporary local shortages or the ability to keep a production process
running. We can obtain an upper bound for the futures price of consumption assets
using arbitrage arguments, but we cannot nail down an equality relationship between
futures and spot prices.
The concept of cost of carry is sometimes useful. The cost of carry is the storage cost
of the underlying asset plus the cost of ﬁnancing it minus the income received from it.
In the case of investment assets, the futures price is greater than the spot price by an
amount reﬂecting the cost of carry. In the case of consumption assets, the futures price
is greater than the spot price by an amount reﬂecting the cost of carry net of the
convenience yield.
If we assume the capital asset pricing model is true, the relationship between the
futures price and the expected future spot price depends on whether the return on the
asset is positively or negatively correlated with the return on the stock market. Positive
correlation will tend to lead to a futures price lower than the expected future spot price,
whereas negative correlation will tend to lead to a futures price higher than the expected
future spot price. Only when the correlation is zero will the theoretical futures price be
equal to the expected future spot price.

on July 31 is 1,300. What is the futures price for a contract deliverable in December 31 of
the same year?

CHAPTER 5

5.12. Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum with continuous compounding
and that the dividend yield on a stock index is 4% per annum. The index is standing at
400, and the futures price for a contract deliverable in four months is 405. What arbitrage
opportunities does this create?
5.13. Estimate the diﬀerence between short-term interest rates in Canada and the United States
on May 14, 2013, from the information in Table 5.4.
5.14. The 2-month interest rates in Switzerland and the United States are, respectively, 1% and
2% per annum with continuous compounding. The spot price of the Swiss franc is
$1.0500. The futures price for a contract deliverable in 2 months is also $1.0500. What
arbitrage opportunities does this create?
5.15. The spot price of silver is $25 per ounce. The storage costs are $0.24 per ounce per year
payable quarterly in advance. Assuming that interest rates are 5% per annum for all
maturities, calculate the futures price of silver for delivery in 9 months.

F2 6 F1erðt2t1Þ
where r is the interest rate (assumed constant) and there are no storage costs. For the
purposes of this problem, assume that a futures contract is the same as a forward
contract.
5.17. When a known future cash outﬂow in a foreign currency is hedged by a company using a
forward contract, there is no foreign exchange risk. When it is hedged using futures
contracts, the daily settlement process does leave the company exposed to some risk.
Explain the nature of this risk. In particular, consider whether the company is better oﬀ
using a futures contract or a forward contract when:
(a) The value of the foreign currency falls rapidly during the life of the contract.
(b) The value of the foreign currency rises rapidly during the life of the contract.
(c) The value of the foreign currency ﬁrst rises and then falls back to its initial value.
(d) The value of the foreign currency ﬁrst falls and then rises back to its initial value.
Assume that the forward price equals the futures price.
5.18. It is sometimes argued that a forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of future
exchange rates. Under what circumstances is this so?
5.19. Show that the growth rate in an index futures price equals the excess return on the
portfolio underlying the index over the risk-free rate. Assume that the risk-free interest
rate and the dividend yield are constant.
5.20. Show that equation (5.3) is true by considering an investment in the asset combined with a
short position in a futures contract. Assume that all income from the asset is reinvested in
the asset. Use an argument similar to that in footnotes 2 and 4 of this chapter and explain
in detail what an arbitrageur would do if equation (5.3) did not hold.
5.21. Explain carefully what is meant by the expected price of a commodity on a particular
future date. Suppose that the futures price for crude oil declines with the maturity of the
contract at the rate of 2% per year. Assume that speculators tend to be short crude oil
futures and hedgers tend to be long. What does the Keynes and Hicks argument imply
about the expected future price of oil?

5.22. The Value Line Index is designed to reﬂect changes in the value of a portfolio of over
1,600 equally weighted stocks. Prior to March 9, 1988, the change in the index from one
day to the next was calculated as the geometric average of the changes in the prices of the
stocks underlying the index. In these circumstances, does equation (5.8) correctly relate
the futures price of the index to its cash price? If not, does the equation overstate or
understate the futures price?
5.23. A US company is interested in using the futures contracts traded by the CME Group to
hedge its Australian dollar exposure. Deﬁne r as the interest rate (all maturities) on the
US dollar and rf as the interest rate (all maturities) on the Australian dollar. Assume that
r and rf are constant and that the company uses a contract expiring at time T to hedge an
exposure at time t (T > t).
(a) Show that the optimal hedge ratio is eðrf rÞðTtÞ.
(b) Show that, when t is 1 day, the optimal hedge ratio is almost exactly S0=F0, where S0 is
the current spot price of the currency and F0 is the current futures price of the
currency for the contract maturing at time T.
(c) Show that the company can take account of the daily settlement of futures contracts
for a hedge that lasts longer than 1 day by adjusting the hedge ratio so that it always
equals the spot price of the currency divided by the futures price of the currency.
5.24. What is meant by (a) an investment asset and (b) a consumption asset. Why is the
distinction between investment and consumption assets important in the determination of
forward and futures prices?
5.25. What is the cost of carry for:
(a) a non-dividend-paying stock
(b) a stock index
(c) a commodity with storage costs
(d) a foreign currency.
Further Questions
5.26. In early 2012, the spot exchange rate between the Swiss Franc and US dollar was 1.0404
($ per franc). Interest rates in the United States and Switzerland were 0.25% and 0% per
annum, respectively, with continuous compounding. The 3-month forward exchange rate
was 1.0300 ($ per franc). What arbitrage strategy was possible? How does your answer
change if the exchange rate is 1.0500 ($ per franc).
5.27. An index is 1,200. The three-month risk-free rate is 3% per annum and the dividend yield
over the next three months is 1.2% per annum. The six-month risk-free rate is 3.5% per
annum and the dividend yield over the next six months is 1% per annum. Estimate the
futures price of the index for three-month and six-month contracts. All interest rates and
dividend yields are continuously compounded.
5.28. The current USD/euro exchange rate is 1.4000 dollar per euro. The six-month forward
exchange rate is 1.3950. The six-month USD interest rate is 1% per annum continuously
compounded. Estimate the six-month euro interest rate.
5.29. The spot price of oil is $80 per barrel and the cost of storing a barrel of oil for one year is
$3, payable at the end of the year. The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum
continuously compounded. What is an upper bound for the one-year futures price of oil?
152
CHAPTER 5

5.30. A stock is expected to pay a dividend of $1 per share in 2 months and in 5 months. The
stock price is $50, and the risk-free rate of interest is 8% per annum with continuous
compounding for all maturities. An investor has just taken a short position in a 6-month
forward contract on the stock.
(a) What are the forward price and the initial value of the forward contract?
(b) Three months later, the price of the stock is $48 and the risk-free rate of interest is
still 8% per annum. What are the forward price and the value of the short position in
the forward contract?
5.31. A bank oﬀers a corporate client a choice between borrowing cash at 11% per annum and
borrowing gold at 2% per annum. (If gold is borrowed, interest must be repaid in gold.
Thus, 100 ounces borrowed today would require 102 ounces to be repaid in 1 year.) The
risk-free interest rate is 9.25% per annum, and storage costs are 0.5% per annum. Discuss
whether the rate of interest on the gold loan is too high or too low in relation to the rate
of interest on the cash loan. The interest rates on the two loans are expressed with annual
compounding. The risk-free interest rate and storage costs are expressed with continuous
compounding.
5.32. A company that is uncertain about the exact date when it will pay or receive a foreign
currency may try to negotiate with its bank a forward contract that speciﬁes a period
during which delivery can be made. The company wants to reserve the right to choose the
exact delivery date to ﬁt in with its own cash ﬂows. Put yourself in the position of the
bank. How would you price the product that the company wants?
5.33. A trader owns a commodity that provides no income and has no storage costs as part of a
long-term investment portfolio. The trader can buy the commodity for $1,250 per ounce
and sell it for $1,249 per ounce. The trader can borrow funds at 6% per year and invest
funds at 5.5% per year (both interest rates are expressed with annual compounding). For
what range of 1-year forward prices does the trader have no arbitrage opportunities?
Assume there is no bid–oﬀer spread for forward prices.
5.34. A company enters into a forward contract with a bank to sell a foreign currency for K1 at
time T1. The exchange rate at time T1 proves to be S1 (> K1). The company asks the bank
if it can roll the contract forward until time T2 (> T1) rather than settle at time T1. The
bank agrees to a new delivery price, K2. Explain how K2 should be calculated.
Determination of Forward and Futures Prices

Interest Rate
Futures
So far we have covered futures contracts on commodities, stock indices, and foreign
currencies. We have seen how they work, how they are used for hedging, and how futures
prices are determined. We now move on to consider interest rate futures.
This chapter explains the popular Treasury bond and Eurodollar futures contracts that
trade in the United States. Many of the other interest rate futures contracts throughout
the world have been modeled on these contracts. The chapter also shows how interest rate
futures contracts, when used in conjunction with the duration measure introduced in
Chapter 4, can be used to hedge a company’s exposure to interest rate movements.
6.1
DAY COUNT AND QUOTATION CONVENTIONS
As a preliminary to the material in this chapter, we consider the day count and quotation
conventions that apply to bonds and other instruments dependent on the interest rate.
Day Counts
The day count deﬁnes the way in which interest accrues over time. Generally, we know the
interest earned over some reference period (e.g., the time between coupon payments on a
bond), and we are interested in calculating the interest earned over some other period.
The day count convention is usually expressed as X=Y. When we are calculating the
interest earned between two dates, X deﬁnes the way in which the number of days
between the two dates is calculated, and Y deﬁnes the way in which the total number of
days in the reference period is measured. The interest earned between the two dates is
Number of days between dates
Number of days in reference period  Interest earned in reference period
Three day count conventions that are commonly used in the United States are:
1. Actual/actual (in period)
2. 30/360
3. Actual/360
154
6
C H A P T E R

The actual/actual (in period) day count is used for Treasury bonds in the United
States. This means that the interest earned between two dates is based on the ratio of the
actual days elapsed to the actual number of days in the period between coupon
payments. Assume that the bond principal is $100, coupon payment dates are March 1
and September 1, and the coupon rate is 8% per annum. (This means that $4 of interest
is paid on each of March 1 and September 1.) Suppose that we wish to calculate the
interest earned between March 1 and July 3. The reference period is from March 1 to
September 1. There are 184 (actual) days in the reference period, and interest of $4 is
earned during the period. There are 124 (actual) days between March 1 and July 3. The
interest earned between March 1 and July 3 is therefore
124
184  4 ¼ 2:6957
The 30/360 day count is used for corporate and municipal bonds in the United States.
This means that we assume 30 days per month and 360 days per year when carrying out
calculations. With the 30/360 day count, the total number of days between March 1 and
September 1 is 180. The total number of days between March 1 and July 3 is
ð4  30Þ þ 2 ¼ 122. In a corporate bond with the same terms as the Treasury bond
just considered, the interest earned between March 1 and July 3 would therefore be
122
180  4 ¼ 2:7111
As shown in Business Snapshot 6.1, sometimes the 30/360 day count convention has
surprising consequences.
The actual/360 day count is used for money market instruments in the United States.
This indicates that the reference period is 360 days. The interest earned during part of a
year is calculated by dividing the actual number of elapsed days by 360 and multiplying
by the rate. The interest earned in 90 days is therefore exactly one-fourth of the quoted
rate, and the interest earned in a whole year of 365 days is 365/360 times the quoted rate.
Conventions vary from country to country and from instrument to instrument. For
example, money market instruments are quoted on an actual/365 basis in Australia,
Canada, and New Zealand. LIBOR is quoted on an actual/360 for all currencies except
sterling, for which it is quoted on an actual/365 basis. Euro-denominated and sterling
bonds are usually quoted on an actual/actual basis.
Business Snapshot 6.1
Day Counts Can Be Deceptive
Between February 28 and March 1, 2015, you have a choice between owning a US
government bond and a US corporate bond. They pay the same coupon and have the
same quoted price. Assuming no risk of default, which would you prefer?
It sounds as though you should be indiﬀerent, but in fact you should have a
marked preference for the corporate bond. Under the 30/360 day count convention
used for corporate bonds, there are 3 days between February 28, 2015, and March 1,
2015. Under the actual/actual (in period) day count convention used for government
bonds, there is only 1 day. You would earn approximately three times as much
interest by holding the corporate bond!
Interest Rate Futures
155

Price Quotations of US Treasury Bills
The prices of money market instruments are sometimes quoted using a discount rate.
This is the interest earned as a percentage of the ﬁnal face value rather than as a
percentage of the initial price paid for the instrument. An example is Treasury bills in
the United States. If the price of a 91-day Treasury bill is quoted as 8, this means that
the rate of interest earned is 8% of the face value per 360 days. Suppose that the face
value is $100. Interest of $2.0222 (¼ $100  0:08  91=360) is earned over the 91-day
life. This corresponds to a true rate of interest of 2:0222=ð100  2:0222Þ ¼ 2:064% for
the 91-day period. In general, the relationship between the cash price per $100 of face
value and the quoted price of a Treasury bill in the United States is
P ¼ 360
n ð100  YÞ
where P is the quoted price, Y is the cash price, and n is the remaining life of the
Treasury bill measured in calendar days. For example, when the cash price of a 90-day
Treasury bill is 99, the quoted price is 4.
Price Quotations of US Treasury Bonds
Treasury bond prices in the United States are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of
a dollar. The quoted price is for a bond with a face value of $100. Thus, a quote of
90-05 or 90 5
32 indicates that the quoted price for a bond with a face value of $100,000
is $90,156.25.
The quoted price, which traders refer to as the clean price, is not the same as the
cash price paid by the purchaser of the bond, which is referred to by traders as the
dirty price. In general,
Cash price ¼ Quoted price þ Accrued interest since last coupon date
To illustrate this formula, suppose that it is March 5, 2015, and the bond under
consideration is an 11% coupon bond maturing on July 10, 2038, with a quoted price
of 95-16 or $95.50. Because coupons are paid semiannually on government bonds (and
the ﬁnal coupon is at maturity), the most recent coupon date is January 10, 2015, and the
next coupon date is July 10, 2015. The (actual) number of days between January 10, 2015,
and March 5, 2015, is 54, whereas the (actual) number of days between January 10, 2015,
and July 10, 2015, is 181. On a bond with $100 face value, the coupon payment is $5.50
on January 10 and July 10. The accrued interest on March 5, 2015, is the share of the
July 10 coupon accruing to the bondholder on March 5, 2015. Because actual/actual in
period is used for Treasury bonds in the United States, this is
54
181  $5:50 ¼ $1:64
The cash price per $100 face value for the bond is therefore
$95:50 þ $1:64 ¼ $97:14
Thus, the cash price of a $100,000 bond is $97,140.

6.2
TREASURY BOND FUTURES
Table 6.1 shows interest rate futures quotes on May 14, 2013. One of the most popular
long-term interest rate futures contracts is the Treasury bond futures contract traded by
the CME Group. In this contract, any government bond that has between 15 and
25 years to maturity on the ﬁrst day of the delivery month can be delivered. A contract
which the CME Group started trading 2010 is the ultra T-bond contract, where any
bond with maturity over 25 years can be delivered.
The 10-year, 5-year, and 2-year Treasury note futures contract in the United States are
also very popular. In the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, any government bond
(or note) with a maturity between 6 1
2 and 10 years can be delivered. In the 5-year and
2-year Treasury note futures contracts, the note delivered has a remaining life of about
5 years and 2 years, respectively (and the original life must be less than 5.25 years).
As will be explained later in this section, the exchange has developed a procedure for
adjusting the price received by the party with the short position according to the
particular bond or note it chooses to deliver. The remaining discussion in this section

focuses on the Treasury bond futures. Many other contracts traded in the United States
and the rest of the world are designed in a similar way to the Treasury bond futures, so
that many of the points we will make are applicable to these contracts as well.
Quotes
Ultra T-bond futures and Treasury bond futures contracts are quoted in dollars and
thirty-seconds of a dollar per $100 face value. This is similar to the way the bonds are
quoted in the spot market. In Table 6.1, the settlement price of the June 2013 Treasury
bond futures contract is speciﬁed as 144-20. This means 144 20
32, or 144.625. The
settlement price of the 10-year Treasury note futures contract is quoted to the nearest
half of a thirty-second. Thus the settlement price of 131-025 for the September 2013
contract should be interpreted as 131 2:5
32, or 131.078125. The 5-year and 2-year Treasury
note contracts are quoted even more precisely, to the nearest quarter of a thirty-second.
Thus the settlement price of 123-307 for the June 5-year Treasury note contract should
be interpreted as 123 30:75
32 , or 123.9609375. Similarly, the trade price of 123-122 for the
September contract should be interpreted as 123 12:25
32 , or 123.3828125.
Conversion Factors
As mentioned, the Treasury bond futures contract allows the party with the short
position to choose to deliver any bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years.
When a particular bond is delivered, a parameter known as its conversion factor deﬁnes
the price received for the bond by the party with the short position. The applicable
quoted price for the bond delivered is the product of the conversion factor and the most
recent settlement price for the futures contract. Taking accrued interest into account (see
Section 6.1), the cash received for each $100 face value of the bond delivered is
ðMost recent settlement price  Conversion factor) þ Accrued interest
Each contract is for the delivery of $100,000 face value of bonds. Suppose that the
most recent settlement price is 90-00, the conversion factor for the bond delivered is
1.3800, and the accrued interest on this bond at the time of delivery is $3 per $100 face
value. The cash received by the party with the short position (and paid by the party
with the long position) is then
ð1:3800  90:00Þ þ 3:00 ¼ $127:20
per $100 face value. A party with the short position in one contract would deliver bonds
with a face value of $100,000 and receive $127,200.
The conversion factor for a bond is set equal to the quoted price the bond would have
per dollar of principal on the ﬁrst day of the delivery month on the assumption that the
interest rate for all maturities equals 6% per annum (with semiannual compounding).
The bond maturity and the times to the coupon payment dates are rounded down to the
nearest 3 months for the purposes of the calculation. The practice enables the exchange
to produce comprehensive tables. If, after rounding, the bond lasts for an exact number
of 6-month periods, the ﬁrst coupon is assumed to be paid in 6 months. If, after
rounding, the bond does not last for an exact number of 6-month periods (i.e., there
are an extra 3 months), the ﬁrst coupon is assumed to be paid after 3 months and
accrued interest is subtracted.
158
CHAPTER 6

As a ﬁrst example of these rules, consider a 10% coupon bond with 20 years and
2 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is
assumed to have exactly 20 years to maturity. The ﬁrst coupon payment is assumed to
be made after 6 months. Coupon payments are then assumed to be made at 6-month
intervals until the end of the 20 years when the principal payment is made. Assume that
the face value is $100. When the discount rate is 6% per annum with semiannual
compounding (or 3% per 6 months), the value of the bond is

Dividing by the face value gives a conversion factor of 1.4623.
As a second example of the rules, consider an 8% coupon bond with 18 years and
4 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is
assumed to have exactly 18 years and 3 months to maturity. Discounting all the payments
back to a point in time 3 months from today at 6% per annum (compounded semi-
annually) gives a value of

back to the present gives the bond’s value as 125:83=1:014889 ¼ $123:99. Subtracting
the accrued interest of 2.0, this becomes $121.99. The conversion factor is therefore
1.2199.
Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond
At any given time during the delivery month, there are many bonds that can be delivered
in the Treasury bond futures contract. These vary widely as far as coupon and maturity
are concerned. The party with the short position can choose which of the available bonds
is ‘‘cheapest’’ to deliver. Because the party with the short position receives
ðMost recent settlement price  Conversion factor) þ Accrued interest
and the cost of purchasing a bond is
Quoted bond price þ Accrued interest
the cheapest-to-deliver bond is the one for which
Quoted bond price  ðMost recent settlement price  Conversion factorÞ
is least. Once the party with the short position has decided to deliver, it can determine
the cheapest-to-deliver bond by examining each of the deliverable bonds in turn.
Example 6.1
The party with the short position has decided to deliver and is trying to choose
between the three bonds in the table below. Assume the most recent settlement
price is 93-08, or 93.25.
Interest Rate Futures
159

The cost of delivering each of the bonds is as follows:
Bond 1: 99:50  ð93:25  1:0382Þ ¼ $2:69
Bond 2: 143:50  ð93:25  1:5188Þ ¼ $1:87
Bond 3: 119:75  ð93:25  1:2615Þ ¼ $2:12
The cheapest-to-deliver bond is Bond 2.
A number of factors determine the cheapest-to-deliver bond. When bond yields are in
excess of 6%, the conversion factor system tends to favor the delivery of low-coupon
long-maturity bonds. When yields are less than 6%, the system tends to favor the
delivery of high-coupon short-maturity bonds. Also, when the yield curve is upward-
sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a long time to maturity to be favored,
whereas when it is downward-sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a short time to
maturity to be delivered.
In addition to the cheapest-to-deliver bond option, the party with a short position
has an option known as the wild card play. This is described in Business Snapshot 6.2.
Determining the Futures Price
An exact theoretical futures price for the Treasury bond contract is diﬃcult to
determine because the short party’s options concerned with the timing of delivery
and choice of the bond that is delivered cannot easily be valued. However, if we assume
that both the cheapest-to-deliver bond and the delivery date are known, the Treasury
bond futures contract is a futures contract on a traded security (the bond) that provides
the holder with known income.1 Equation (5.2) then shows that the futures price, F0, is
related to the spot price, S0, by
F0 ¼ ðS0  IÞerT
ð6:1Þ
where I is the present value of the coupons during the life of the futures contract, T is
the time until the futures contract matures, and r is the risk-free interest rate applicable
to a time period of length T.
Example 6.2
Suppose that, in a Treasury bond futures contract, it is known that the cheapest-
to-deliver bond will be a 12% coupon bond with a conversion factor of 1.6000.
Suppose also that it is known that delivery will take place in 270 days. Coupons
are payable semiannually on the bond. As illustrated in Figure 6.1, the last coupon
date was 60 days ago, the next coupon date is in 122 days, and the coupon date
thereafter is in 305 days. The term structure is ﬂat, and the rate of interest (with

continuous compounding) is 10% per annum. Assume that the current quoted
bond price is $115. The cash price of the bond is obtained by adding to this
quoted price the proportion of the next coupon payment that accrues to the
holder. The cash price is therefore

The Wild Card Play
The settlement price in the CME Group’s Treasury bond futures contract is the price
at 2:00 p.m. Chicago time. However, Treasury bonds continue trading in the spot
market beyond this time and a trader with a short position can issue to the clearing
house a notice of intention to deliver later in the day. If the notice is issued, the
invoice price is calculated on the basis of the settlement price that day, that is, the
price at 2:00 p.m.
This practice gives rise to an option known as the wild card play. If bond prices
decline after 2:00 p.m. on the ﬁrst day of the delivery month, the party with the
short position can issue a notice of intention to deliver at, say, 3:45 p.m. and
proceed to buy bonds in the spot market for delivery at a price calculated from the
2:00 p.m. futures price. If the bond price does not decline, the party with the short
position keeps the position open and waits until the next day when the same
strategy can be used.
As with the other options open to the party with the short position, the wild card
play is not free. Its value is reﬂected in the futures price, which is lower than it would
be without the option.

EURODOLLAR FUTURES
The most popular interest rate futures contract in the United States is the three-month
Eurodollar futures contract traded by the CME Group. A Eurodollar is a dollar
deposited in a US or foreign bank outside the United States. The Eurodollar interest
rate is the rate of interest earned on Eurodollars deposited by one bank with another
bank. It is essentially the same as the London Interbank Oﬀered Rate (LIBOR)
introduced in Chapter 4.
A three-month Eurodollar futures contract is a futures contract on the interest that will
be paid (by someone who borrows at the Eurodollar interest rate) on $1 million for a
future three-month period. It allows a trader to speculate on a future three-month interest
rate or to hedge an exposure to a future three-month interest rate. Eurodollar futures
contracts have maturities in March, June, September, and December for up to 10 years
into the future. This means that in 2014 a trader can use Eurodollar futures to take a
position on what interest rates will be as far into the future as 2024. Short-maturity
contracts trade for months other than March, June, September, and December.
To understand how Eurodollar futures contracts work, consider the June 2013
contract in Table 6.1. The settlement price on May 13, 2013, is 99.725. The last trading
day is two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month, which in the case of
this contract is June 17, 2013. The contract is settled daily in the usual way until the last
trading day. At 11 a.m. on the last trading day, there is a ﬁnal settlement equal to
100  R, where R is the three-month LIBOR ﬁxing on that day, expressed with quarterly
compounding and an actual/360 day count convention. Thus, if the three-month
Eurodollar interest rate on June 17, 2013, turned out to be 0.75% (actual/360 with
quarterly compounding), the ﬁnal settlement price would be 99.250. Once a ﬁnal
settlement has taken place, all contracts are declared closed.
The contract is designed so that a one-basis-point (¼ 0:01) move in the futures quote
corresponds to a gain or loss of $25 per contract. When a Eurodollar futures quote
increases by one basis point, a trader who is long one contract gains $25 and a trader
who is short one contract loses $25. Similarly, when the quote decreases by one basis
point a trader who is long one contract loses $25 and a trader who is short one contract
gains $25. Suppose, for example, a settlement price changes from 99.725 to 99.685.
Traders with long positions lose 4  25 ¼ $100 per contract; traders with short posi-
tions gain $100 per contract. A one-basis-point change in the futures quote corresponds
to a 0.01% change in the underlying interest rate. This in turn leads to a
1,000,000  0:0001  0:25 ¼ 25
162
CHAPTER 6

or $25 change in the interest that will be earned on $1 million in three months. The $25
per basis point rule is therefore consistent with the point made earlier that the contract
locks in an interest rate on $1 million for three months.
The futures quote is 100 minus the futures interest rate. An investor who is long gains
when interest rates fall and one who is short gains when interest rates rise. Table 6.2
shows a possible set of outcomes for the June 2013 contract in Table 6.1 for a trader who
takes a long position at the May 13, 2013, settlement price.
The contract price is deﬁned as
10,000  ½100  0:25  ð100  QÞ
ð6:2Þ
where Q is the quote. Thus, the settlement price of 99.725 for the June 2013 contract in
Table 6.1 corresponds to a contract price of
10,000  ½100  0:25  ð100  99:725Þ ¼ $999,312:5
In Table 6.2, the ﬁnal contract price is
10;000  ½100  0:25  ð100  99:615Þ ¼ $999,037:5
and the diﬀerence between the initial and ﬁnal contract price is $275, This is consistent
with the loss calculated in Table 6.2 using the ‘‘$25 per one-basis-point move’’ rule.
Example 6.3
An investor wants to lock in the interest rate for a three-month period beginning
two days before the third Wednesday of September, on a principal of $100
million. We suppose that the September Eurodollar futures quote is 96.50, in-
dicating that the investor can lock in an interest rate of 100  96:5 or 3.5% per
annum. The investor hedges by buying 100 contracts. Suppose that, two days
before the third Wednesday of September, the three-month Eurodollar rate turns
out to be 2.6%. The ﬁnal settlement in the contract is then at a price of 97.40. The
investor gains
100  25  ð9,740  9,650Þ ¼ 225,000
or $225,000 on the Eurodollar futures contracts. The interest earned on the three-
month investment is

or $650,000. The gain on the Eurodollar futures brings this up to $875,000,
which is what the interest would be at 3.5% (100,000,000  0:25  0:035 ¼
875,000).
It appears that the futures trade has the eﬀect of exactly locking an interest rate
of 3.5% in all circumstances. In fact, the hedge is less than perfect because
(a) futures contracts are settled daily (not all at the end) and (b) the ﬁnal settle-
ment in the futures contract happens at contract maturity, whereas the interest
payment on the investment is three months later. One approximate adjustment for
the second point is to reduce the size of the hedge to reﬂect the diﬀerence between
funds received in September, and funds received three months later. In this case,
we would assume an interest rate of 3.5% for the three-month period and multiply
the number of contracts by 1=ð1 þ 0:035  0:25Þ ¼ 0:9913. This would lead to 99
rather than 100 contracts being purchased.
Table 6.1 shows that the interest rate term structure in the US was upward sloping in
May 2013. Using the ‘‘Prior Settlement’’ column, the futures rates for three-month
periods beginning June 17, 2013, September 16, 2013, December 16, 2013, December 14,
2015, December 18, 2017, and December 16, 2019, were 0.275%, 0.295%, 0.325%,
0.900%, 2.270%, and 3.324%, respectively.
Example 6.3 shows how Eurodollar futures contracts can be used by an investor who
wants to hedge the interest that will be earned during a future three-month period.
Note that the timing of the cash ﬂows from the hedge does not line up exactly with the
timing of the interest cash ﬂows. This is because the futures contract is settled daily.
Also, the ﬁnal settlement is in September, whereas interest payments on the investment
are received three months later in December. As indicated in the example, a small
adjustment can be made to the hedge position to approximately allow for this second
point.
Other contracts similar to the CME Group’s Eurodollar futures contracts trade on
interest rates in other countries. The CME Group trades Euroyen contracts. The London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (part of Euronext) trades three-
month Euribor contracts (i.e., contracts on the three-month rate for euro deposits
between euro zone banks) and three-month Euroswiss futures.
Forward vs. Futures Interest Rates
The Eurodollar futures contract is similar to a forward rate agreement (FRA: see
Section 4.7) in that it locks in an interest rate for a future period. For short maturities
(up to a year or so), the Eurodollar futures interest rate can be assumed to be the same
as the corresponding forward interest rate. For longer-dated contracts, diﬀerences
between the contracts become important. Compare a Eurodollar futures contract on
an interest rate for the period between times T1 and T2 with an FRA for the same
period. The Eurodollar futures contract is settled daily. The ﬁnal settlement is at time T1
and reﬂects the realized interest rate for the period between times T1 and T2. By contrast
the FRA is not settled daily and the ﬁnal settlement reﬂecting the realized interest rate
between times T1 and T2 is made at time T2.2
There are therefore two diﬀerences between a Eurodollar futures contract and an
2 As mentioned in Section 4.7, settlement may occur at time T1, but it is then equal to the present value of
what the forward contract payoﬀwould be at time T2.
164
CHAPTER 6

FRA. These are:
1. The diﬀerence between a Eurodollar futures contract and a similar contract where
there is no daily settlement. The latter is a hypothetical forward contract where a
payoﬀequal to the diﬀerence between the forward interest rate and the realized
interest rate is paid at time T1.
2. The diﬀerence between the hypothetical forward contract where there is settlement
at time T1 and a true forward contract where there is settlement at time T2 equal to
the diﬀerence between the forward interest rate and the realized interest rate.
These two components to the diﬀerence between the contracts cause some confusion in
practice. Both decrease the forward rate relative to the futures rate, but for long-dated
contracts the reduction caused by the second diﬀerence is much smaller than that caused
by the ﬁrst. The reason why the ﬁrst diﬀerence (daily settlement) decreases the forward
rate follows from the arguments in Section 5.8. Suppose you have a contract where the
payoﬀis RM  RF at time T1, where RF is a predetermined rate for the period between T1
and T2 and RM is the realized rate for this period, and you have the option to switch to
daily settlement. In this case daily settlement tends to lead to cash inﬂows when rates are
high and cash outﬂows when rates are low. You would therefore ﬁnd switching to daily
settlement to be attractive because you tend to have more money in your margin account
when rates are high. As a result the market would therefore set RF higher for the daily
settlement alternative (reducing your cumulative expected payoﬀ). To put this the other
way round, switching from daily settlement to settlement at time T1 reduces RF.
To understand the reason why the second diﬀerence reduces the forward rate,
suppose that the payoﬀof RM  RF is at time T2 instead of T1 (as it is for a regular
FRA). If RM is high, the payoﬀis positive. Because rates are high, the cost to you of
having the payoﬀthat you receive at time T2 rather than time T1 is relatively high. If RM
is low, the payoﬀis negative. Because rates are low, the beneﬁt to you of having the
payoﬀyou make at time T2 rather than time T1 is relatively low. Overall you would
rather have the payoﬀat time T1. If it is at time T2 rather than T1, you must be
compensated by a reduction in RF.3
Convexity Adjustment
Analysts make what is known as a convexity adjustment to account for the total
diﬀerence between the two rates. One popular adjustment is4
Forward rate ¼ Futures rate  1
22T1T2
ð6:3Þ
where, as above, T1 is the time to maturity of the futures contract and T2 is the time to
the maturity of the rate underlying the futures contract. The variable  is the standard
deviation of the change in the short-term interest rate in 1 year. Both rates are expressed
with continuous compounding.5
3 Quantifying the eﬀect of this type of timing diﬀerence on the value of a derivative is discussed further in
Chapter 30.
4 See Technical Note 1 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes for a proof of this.
5 This formula is based on the Ho–Lee interest rate model, which will be discussed in Chapter 31. See
T. S. Y. Ho and S.-B. Lee, ‘‘Term structure movements and pricing interest rate contingent claims,’’ Journal
of Finance, 41 (December 1986), 1011–29.

annual rate of ð365=90Þ ln 1:015 ¼ 6:038% with continuous compounding and an

therefore, is 6:038  0:475 ¼ 5:563% per annum with continuous compounding.
The table below shows how the size of the adjustment increases with the time to
maturity.
We can see from this table that the size of the adjustment is roughly pro-
portional to the square of the time to maturity of the futures contract. For
example, when the maturity doubles from 2 to 4 years, the size of the convexity
approximately quadruples.
Using Eurodollar Futures to Extend the LIBOR Zero Curve
The LIBOR zero curve out to 1 year is determined by the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month,
and 12-month LIBOR rates. Once the convexity adjustment just described has been
made, Eurodollar futures are often used to extend the zero curve. Suppose that the ith
Eurodollar futures contract matures at time Ti (i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ). It is usually assumed that
the forward interest rate calculated from the ith futures contract applies to the period Ti
to Tiþ1. (In practice this is close to true.) This enables a bootstrap procedure to be used to
determine zero rates. Suppose that Fi is the forward rate calculated from the ith
Eurodollar futures contract and Ri is the zero rate for a maturity Ti. From equation (4.5),
Fi ¼ Riþ1Tiþ1  RiTi
Tiþ1  Ti
so that
Riþ1 ¼ FiðTiþ1  TiÞ þ RiTi

Other Euro rates such as Euroswiss, Euroyen, and Euribor are used in a similar way.

CHAPTER 6

Example 6.5
The 400-day LIBOR zero rate has been calculated as 4.80% with continuous
compounding and, from Eurodollar futures quotes, it has been calculated that
(a) the forward rate for a 90-day period beginning in 400 days is 5.30% with
continuous compounding, (b) the forward rate for a 90-day period beginning in
491 days is 5.50% with continuous compounding, and (c) the forward rate for a
90-day period beginning in 589 days is 5.60% with continuous compounding. We
can use equation (6.4) to obtain the 491-day rate as
0:053  91 þ 0:048  400
491
¼ 0:04893
or 4.893%. Similarly we can use the second forward rate to obtain the 589-day
rate as
0:055  98 þ 0:04893  491
589
¼ 0:04994
or 4.994%. The next forward rate of 5.60% would be used to determine the zero
curve out to the maturity of the next Eurodollar futures contract. (Note that, even
though the rate underlying the Eurodollar futures contract is a 90-day rate, it is
assumed to apply to the 91 or 98 days elapsing between Eurodollar contract
maturities.)
6.4
DURATION-BASED HEDGING STRATEGIES USING FUTURES
We discussed duration in Section 4.8. Consider the situation where a position in an
asset that is interest rate dependent, such as a bond portfolio or a money market
security, is being hedged using an interest rate futures contract. Deﬁne:
VF : Contract price for one interest rate futures contract
DF : Duration of the asset underlying the futures contract at the maturity of the
futures contract
P: Forward value of the portfolio being hedged at the maturity of the hedge (in
practice, this is usually assumed to be the same as the value of the portfolio
today)
DP : Duration of the portfolio at the maturity of the hedge
If we assume that the change in the yield, y, is the same for all maturities, which
means that only parallel shifts in the yield curve can occur, it is approximately true that
P ¼ PDP y
It is also approximately true that
VF ¼ VFDF y
The number of contracts required to hedge against an uncertain y, therefore, is
N  ¼ PDP
VFDF
ð6:5Þ
Interest Rate Futures
167

This is the duration-based hedge ratio. It is sometimes also called the price sensitivity
hedge ratio.6 Using it has the eﬀect of making the duration of the entire position
zero.
When the hedging instrument is a Treasury bond futures contract, the hedger must
base DF on an assumption that one particular bond will be delivered. This means that
the hedger must estimate which of the available bonds is likely to be cheapest to deliver
at the time the hedge is put in place. If, subsequently, the interest rate environment
changes so that it looks as though a diﬀerent bond will be cheapest to deliver, then the
hedge has to be adjusted and as a result its performance may be worse than
anticipated.
When hedges are constructed using interest rate futures, it is important to bear in
mind that interest rates and futures prices move in opposite directions. When interest
rates go up, an interest rate futures price goes down. When interest rates go down, the
reverse happens, and the interest rate futures price goes up. Thus, a company in a
position to lose money if interest rates drop should hedge by taking a long futures
position. Similarly, a company in a position to lose money if interest rates rise should
hedge by taking a short futures position.
The hedger tries to choose the futures contract so that the duration of the underlying
asset is as close as possible to the duration of the asset being hedged. Eurodollar futures
tend to be used for exposures to short-term interest rates, whereas ultra T-bond,
Treasury bond, and Treasury note futures contracts are used for exposures to longer-
term rates.
Example 6.6
It is August 2 and a fund manager with $10 million invested in government bonds is
concerned that interest rates are expected to be highly volatile over the next
3 months. The fund manager decides to use the December T-bond futures contract
to hedge the value of the portfolio. The current futures price is 93-02, or 93.0625.
Because each contract is for the delivery of $100,000 face value of bonds, the futures
contract price is $93,062.50.
Suppose that the duration of the bond portfolio in 3 months will be
6.80 years. The cheapest-to-deliver bond in the T-bond contract is expected to
be a 20-year 12% per annum coupon bond. The yield on this bond is currently
8.80% per annum, and the duration will be 9.20 years at maturity of the futures
contract.
The fund manager requires a short position in T-bond futures to hedge the
bond portfolio. If interest rates go up, a gain will be made on the short futures
position, but a loss will be made on the bond portfolio. If interest rates decrease, a
loss will be made on the short position, but there will be a gain on the bond
portfolio. The number of bond futures contracts that should be shorted can be
calculated from equation (6.5) as
10,000,000
93,062:50  6:80
9:20 ¼ 79:42
To the nearest whole number, the portfolio manager should short 79 contracts.

Treasury Bond Futures,’’ Journal of Fixed Income 9, 1 (June 1999): 84–91.

CHAPTER 6

6.5
HEDGING PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial institutions sometimes attempt to hedge themselves against interest rate risk
by ensuring that the average duration of their assets equals the average duration of their
liabilities. (The liabilities can be regarded as short positions in bonds.) This strategy is
known as duration matching or portfolio immunization. When implemented, it ensures
that a small parallel shift in interest rates will have little eﬀect on the value of the
portfolio of assets and liabilities. The gain (loss) on the assets should oﬀset the loss
(gain) on the liabilities.
Duration matching does not immunize a portfolio against nonparallel shifts in the
zero curve. This is a weakness of the approach. In practice, short-term rates are usually
more volatile than, and are not perfectly correlated with, long-term rates. Sometimes it
even happens that short- and long-term rates move in opposite directions to each
other. Duration matching is therefore only a ﬁrst step and ﬁnancial institutions have
developed other tools to help them manage their interest rate exposure. See Business
Snapshot 6.3.
SUMMARY
Two very popular interest rate contracts are the Treasury bond and Eurodollar futures
contracts that trade in the United States. In the Treasury bond futures contracts, the
party with the short position has a number of interesting delivery options:
1. Delivery can be made on any day during the delivery month.
2. There are a number of alternative bonds that can be delivered.
3. On any day during the delivery month, the notice of intention to deliver at the
2:00 p.m. settlement price can be made later in the day.
These options all tend to reduce the futures price.
Business Snapshot 6.3
Asset–Liability Management by Banks
The asset–liability management (ALM) committees of banks now monitor their
exposure to interest rates very carefully. Matching the durations of assets and
liabilities is sometimes a ﬁrst step, but this does not protect a bank against non-
parallel shifts in the yield curve. A popular approach is known as GAP management.
This involves dividing the zero-coupon yield curve into segments, known as buckets.
The ﬁrst bucket might be 0 to 1 month, the second 1 to 3 months, and so on. The
ALM committee then investigates the eﬀect on the value of the bank’s portfolio of
the zero rates corresponding to one bucket changing while those corresponding to all
other buckets stay the same.
If there is a mismatch, corrective action is usually taken. This can involve changing
deposit and lending rates in the way described in Section 4.10. Alternatively, tools
such as swaps, FRAs, bond futures, Eurodollar futures, and other interest rate
derivatives can be used.
Interest Rate Futures
169

The Eurodollar futures contract is a contract on the 3-month Eurodollar interest rate
two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. Eurodollar futures are
frequently used to estimate LIBOR forward rates for the purpose of constructing a
LIBOR zero curve. When long-dated contracts are used in this way, it is important to
make what is termed a convexity adjustment to allow for the diﬀerence between
Eurodollar futures and FRAs.
The concept of duration is important in hedging interest rate risk. It enables a
hedger to assess the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to small parallel shifts in the yield
curve. It also enables the hedger to assess the sensitivity of an interest rate futures price
to small changes in the yield curve. The number of futures contracts necessary to
protect the bond portfolio against small parallel shifts in the yield curve can therefore
be calculated.
The key assumption underlying duration-based hedging is that all interest rates
change by the same amount. This means that only parallel shifts in the term structure
are allowed for. In practice, short-term interest rates are generally more volatile than are
long-term interest rates, and hedge performance is liable to be poor if the duration of
the bond underlying the futures contract diﬀers markedly from the duration of the asset
being hedged.

Swaps
The birth of the over-the-counter swap market can be traced to a currency swap
negotiated between IBM and the World Bank in 1981. The World Bank had borrow-
ings denominated in US dollars while IBM had borrowings denominated in German
deutsche marks and Swiss francs. The World Bank (which was restricted in the deutsche
mark and Swiss franc borrowing it could do directly) agreed to make interest payments
on IBM’s borrowings while IBM in return agreed to make interest payments on the
World Bank’s borrowings.
Since that ﬁrst transaction in 1981, the swap market has seen phenomenal growth.
Swaps now occupy a position of central importance in over-the-counter derivatives
market. The statistics produced by the Bank for International Settlements show that
about 58.5% of all over-the-counter derivatives are interest rate swaps and a further 4%
are currency swaps. Most of this chapter is devoted to discussing these two types of
swap. Other swaps are brieﬂy reviewed at the end of the chapter and discussed in more
detail in later chapters (in particular, Chapters 25 and 33).
A swap is an over-the-counter agreement between two companies to exchange cash
ﬂows in the future. The agreement deﬁnes the dates when the cash ﬂows are to be paid
and the way in which they are to be calculated. Usually the calculation of the cash ﬂows
involves the future value of an interest rate, an exchange rate, or other market variable.
A forward contract can be viewed as a simple example of a swap. Suppose it is
March 1, 2016, and a company enters into a forward contract to buy 100 ounces of gold
for $1,500 per ounce in 1 year. The company can sell the gold in 1 year as soon as it is
received. The forward contract is therefore equivalent to a swap where the company
agrees that it will pay $150,000 and receive 100S on March 1, 2017, where S is the
market price of 1 ounce of gold on that date. However, whereas a forward contract is
equivalent to the exchange of cash ﬂows on just one future date, swaps typically lead to
cash ﬂow exchanges on several future dates.
The most popular (plain vanilla) interest rate swap is one where LIBOR is exchanged
for a ﬁxed rate of interest. When valuing swaps, we require a ‘‘risk-free’’ discount rate
for cash ﬂows. As mentioned in Section 4.1, LIBOR has traditionally been used as a
proxy for the ‘‘risk-free’’ discount rate. As it happens, this greatly simpliﬁes valuation of
plain vanilla interest rate swaps because the discount rate is then the same as the
reference interest rate in the swap. Since the 2008 credit crisis, other risk-free discount
rates have been used, particularly for collateralized transactions. In this chapter, we
assume that LIBOR is used as the risk-free discount rate. In Chapter 9, we will revisit
174
7
C H A P T E R

this assumption and discuss both the choice of the risk-free rate and its impact on the
valuation of interest rate swaps.
7.1
MECHANICS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS
In an interest rate swap, one company agrees to pay to another company cash ﬂows
equal to interest at a predetermined ﬁxed rate on a notional principal for a predeter-
mined number of years. In return, it receives interest at a ﬂoating rate on the same
notional principal for the same period of time from the other company.
LIBOR
The ﬂoating rate in most interest rate swap agreements is the London Interbank Oﬀered
Rate (LIBOR). We introduced this in Chapter 4. It is the rate of interest at which a bank
with a AA credit rating is able to borrow from other banks.
Just as prime is often the reference rate of interest for ﬂoating-rate loans in the
domestic ﬁnancial market, LIBOR is a reference rate of interest for loans in inter-
national ﬁnancial markets. To understand how it is used, consider a 5-year bond with a
rate of interest speciﬁed as 6-month LIBOR plus 0.5% per annum. The life of the bond
is divided into 10 periods, each 6 months in length. For each period, the rate of interest
is set at 0.5% per annum above the 6-month LIBOR rate at the beginning of the period.
Interest is paid at the end of the period.
We will refer to a swap where LIBOR is exchanged for a ﬁxed rate of interest as a
‘‘LIBOR-for-ﬁxed’’ swap.
Illustration
Consider a hypothetical 3-year swap initiated on March 5, 2014, between Microsoft and
Intel. We suppose Microsoft agrees to pay Intel an interest rate of 5% per annum on a
principal of $100 million, and in return Intel agrees to pay Microsoft the 6-month
LIBOR rate on the same principal. Microsoft is the ﬁxed-rate payer; Intel is the ﬂoating-
rate payer. We assume the agreement speciﬁes that payments are to be exchanged every
6 months and that the 5% interest rate is quoted with semiannual compounding. This
swap is represented diagrammatically in Figure 7.1.
The ﬁrst exchange of payments would take place on September 5, 2014, 6 months
after the initiation of the agreement. Microsoft would pay Intel $2.5 million. This is the
interest on the $100 million principal for 6 months at 5%. Intel would pay Microsoft
interest on the $100 million principal at the 6-month LIBOR rate prevailing 6 months
prior to September 5, 2014—that is, on March 5, 2014. Suppose that the 6-month

LIBOR rate on March 5, 2014, is 4.2%. Intel pays Microsoft 0:5  0:042  $100 ¼
$2:1 million.1 Note that there is no uncertainty about this ﬁrst exchange of payments
because it is determined by the LIBOR rate at the time the swap begins.
The second exchange of payments would take place on March 5, 2015, a year after
the initiation of the agreement. Microsoft would pay $2.5 million to Intel. Intel would
pay interest on the $100 million principal to Microsoft at the 6-month LIBOR rate
prevailing 6 months prior to March 5, 2015—that is, on September 5, 2014. Suppose
that the 6-month LIBOR rate on September 5, 2014, proves to be 4.8%. Intel pays
0:5  0:048  $100 ¼ $2:4 million to Microsoft.
In total, there are six exchanges of payment on the swap. The ﬁxed payments are
always $2.5 million. The ﬂoating-rate payments on a payment date are calculated
using the 6-month LIBOR rate prevailing 6 months before the payment date. An
interest rate swap is generally structured so that one side remits the diﬀerence between
the two payments to the other side. In our example, Microsoft would pay Intel
$0.4 million (¼ $2:5 million  $2:1 million) on September 5, 2014, and $0.1 million
(¼ $2:5 million  $2:4 million) on March 5, 2015.
Table 7.1 provides a complete example of the payments made under the swap for one
particular set of 6-month LIBOR rates. The table shows the swap cash ﬂows from the
perspective of Microsoft. Note that the $100 million principal is used only for the
calculation of interest payments. The principal itself is not exchanged. For this reason it
is termed the notional principal, or just the notional.
If the notional principal were exchanged at the end of the life of the swap, the nature
of the deal would not be changed in any way. The notional principal is the same for
both the ﬁxed and ﬂoating payments. Exchanging $100 million for $100 million at the
end of the life of the swap is a transaction that would have no ﬁnancial value to either
Microsoft or Intel. Table 7.2 shows the cash ﬂows in Table 7.1 with a ﬁnal exchange of
principal added in. This provides an interesting way of viewing the swap. The cash ﬂows

CHAPTER 7

the exchange of a ﬁxed-rate bond for a ﬂoating-rate bond. Microsoft, whose position is
described by Table 7.2, is long a ﬂoating-rate bond and short a ﬁxed-rate bond. Intel is
long a ﬁxed-rate bond and short a ﬂoating-rate bond.
This characterization of the cash ﬂows in the swap helps to explain why the ﬂoating
rate in the swap is set 6 months before it is paid. On a ﬂoating-rate bond, interest is
generally set at the beginning of the period to which it will apply and is paid at the end
of the period. The calculation of the ﬂoating-rate payments in a ‘‘plain vanilla’’ interest
rate swap, such as the one in Table 7.2, reﬂects this.
Using the Swap to Transform a Liability
For Microsoft, the swap could be used to transform a ﬂoating-rate loan into a ﬁxed-rate
loan. Suppose that Microsoft has arranged to borrow $100 million at LIBOR plus
10 basis points. (One basis point is one-hundredth of 1%, so the rate is LIBOR
plus 0.1%.) After Microsoft has entered into the swap, it has the following three sets
of cash ﬂows:
1. It pays LIBOR plus 0.1% to its outside lenders.
2. It receives LIBOR under the terms of the swap.
3. It pays 5% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash ﬂows net out to an interest rate payment of 5.1%. Thus, for
Microsoft, the swap could have the eﬀect of transforming borrowings at a ﬂoating rate
of LIBOR plus 10 basis points into borrowings at a ﬁxed rate of 5.1%.
For Intel, the swap could have the eﬀect of transforming a ﬁxed-rate loan into a
ﬂoating-rate loan. Suppose that Intel has a 3-year $100 million loan outstanding on

which it pays 5.2%. After it has entered into the swap, it has the following three sets of
cash ﬂows:
1. It pays 5.2% to its outside lenders.
2. It pays LIBOR under the terms of the swap.
3. It receives 5% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash ﬂows net out to an interest rate payment of LIBOR plus 0.2%
(or LIBOR plus 20 basis points). Thus, for Intel, the swap could have the eﬀect of
transforming borrowings at a ﬁxed rate of 5.2% into borrowings at a ﬂoating rate of
LIBOR plus 20 basis points. These potential uses of the swap by Intel and Microsoft
are illustrated in Figure 7.2.
Using the Swap to Transform an Asset
Swaps can also be used to transform the nature of an asset. Consider Microsoft in our
example. The swap could have the eﬀect of transforming an asset earning a ﬁxed rate of
interest into an asset earning a ﬂoating rate of interest. Suppose that Microsoft owns
$100 million in bonds that will provide interest at 4.7% per annum over the next 3 years.
After Microsoft has entered into the swap, it has the following three sets of cash ﬂows:
1. It receives 4.7% on the bonds.
2. It receives LIBOR under the terms of the swap.
3. It pays 5% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash ﬂows net out to an interest rate inﬂow of LIBOR minus 30 basis
points. Thus, one possible use of the swap for Microsoft is to transform an asset
earning 4.7% into an asset earning LIBOR minus 30 basis points.
Next, consider Intel. The swap could have the eﬀect of transforming an asset earning
a ﬂoating rate of interest into an asset earning a ﬁxed rate of interest. Suppose that Intel
has an investment of $100 million that yields LIBOR minus 20 basis points. After it has
entered into the swap, it has the following three sets of cash ﬂows:
1. It receives LIBOR minus 20 basis points on its investment.
2. It pays LIBOR under the terms of the swap.
3. It receives 5% under the terms of the swap.
These three sets of cash ﬂows net out to an interest rate inﬂow of 4.8%. Thus, one
possible use of the swap for Intel is to transform an asset earning LIBOR minus
20 basis points into an asset earning 4.8%. These potential uses of the swap by Intel
and Microsoft are illustrated in Figure 7.3.

CHAPTER 7

Role of Financial Intermediary
Usually two nonﬁnancial companies such as Intel and Microsoft do not get in touch
directly to arrange a swap in the way indicated in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. They each deal
with a bank or other ﬁnancial institution. ‘‘Plain vanilla’’ LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swaps on
US interest rates are usually structured so that the ﬁnancial institution earns about 3 or
4 basis points (0.03% or 0.04%) on a pair of oﬀsetting transactions.
Figure 7.4 shows what the role of the ﬁnancial institution might be in the situation in
Figure 7.2. The ﬁnancial institution enters into two oﬀsetting swap transactions with
Intel and Microsoft. Assuming that both companies honor their obligations, the
ﬁnancial institution is certain to make a proﬁt of 0.03% (3 basis points) per year
multiplied by the notional principal of $100 million. This amounts to $30,000 per year
for the 3-year period. Microsoft ends up borrowing at 5.115% (instead of 5.1%, as in
Figure 7.2), and Intel ends up borrowing at LIBOR plus 21.5 basis points (instead of at
LIBOR plus 20 basis points, as in Figure 7.2).
Figure 7.5 illustrates the role of the ﬁnancial institution in the situation in Figure 7.3.
The swap is the same as before and the ﬁnancial institution is certain to make a proﬁt
of 3 basis points if neither company defaults. Microsoft ends up earning LIBOR minus
31.5 basis points (instead of LIBOR minus 30 basis points, as in Figure 7.3), and Intel
ends up earning 4.785% (instead of 4.8%, as in Figure 7.3).
Note that in each case the ﬁnancial institution has entered into two separate trans-
actions: one with Intel and the other with Microsoft. In most instances, Intel will not
even know that the ﬁnancial institution has entered into an oﬀsetting swap with
Microsoft, and vice versa. If one of the companies defaults, the ﬁnancial institution
still has to honor its agreement with the other company. The 3-basis-point spread
earned by the ﬁnancial institution is partly to compensate it for the risk that one of the
two companies will default on the swap payments.
Market Makers
In practice, it is unlikely that two companies will contact a ﬁnancial institution at the
same time and want to take opposite positions in exactly the same swap. For this

reason, many large ﬁnancial institutions act as market makers for swaps. This means
that they are prepared to enter into a swap without having an oﬀsetting swap with
another counterparty.2 Market makers must carefully quantify and hedge the risks they
are taking. Bonds, forward rate agreements, and interest rate futures are examples of the
instruments that can be used for hedging by swap market makers. Table 7.3 shows
quotes for plain vanilla US dollar swaps that might be posted by a market maker.3 As
mentioned earlier, the bid–oﬀer spread is 3 to 4 basis points. The average of the bid and
oﬀer ﬁxed rates is known as the swap rate. This is shown in the ﬁnal column of
Table 7.3.
Consider a new swap where the ﬁxed rate equals the current swap rate. We can
reasonably assume that the value of this swap is zero. (Why else would a market maker
choose bid–oﬀer quotes centered on the swap rate?) In Table 7.2 we saw that a swap can
be characterized as the diﬀerence between a ﬁxed-rate bond and a ﬂoating-rate bond.
Deﬁne:
Bﬁx: Value of ﬁxed-rate bond underlying the swap we are considering
Bﬂ: Value of ﬂoating-rate bond underlying the swap we are considering
Since the swap is worth zero, it follows that
Bﬁx ¼ Bﬂ
ð7:1Þ
We will use this result later in the chapter when discussing the determination of the
LIBOR/swap zero curve.
7.2
DAY COUNT ISSUES
We discussed day count conventions in Section 6.1. The day count conventions aﬀect
payments on a swap, and some of the numbers calculated in the examples we have given
do not exactly reﬂect these day count conventions. Consider, for example, the 6-month
LIBOR payments in Table 7.1. Because it is a US money market rate, 6-month LIBOR

3 The standard swap in the United States is one where ﬁxed payments made every 6 months are exchanged
for ﬂoating LIBOR payments made every 3 months. In Table 7.1 we assumed that ﬁxed and ﬂoating
payments are exchanged every 6 months.

CHAPTER 7

is quoted on an actual/360 basis. The ﬁrst ﬂoating payment in Table 7.1, based on the
LIBOR rate of 4.2%, is shown as $2.10 million. Because there are 184 days between
March 5, 2014, and September 5, 2014, it should be
100  0:042  184
360 ¼ $2:1467 million
In general, a LIBOR-based ﬂoating-rate cash ﬂow on a swap payment date is calculated
as LRn=360, where L is the principal, R is the relevant LIBOR rate, and n is the number
of days since the last payment date.
The ﬁxed rate that is paid in a swap transaction is similarly quoted with a particular
day count basis being speciﬁed. As a result, the ﬁxed payments may not be exactly equal
on each payment date. The ﬁxed rate is usually quoted as actual/365 or 30/360. It is not
therefore directly comparable with LIBOR because it applies to a full year. To make the
rates approximately comparable, either the 6-month LIBOR rate must be multiplied by
365/360 or the ﬁxed rate must be multiplied by 360/365.
For clarity of exposition, we will ignore day count issues in the calculations in the rest
of this chapter.
7.3
CONFIRMATIONS
A conﬁrmation is the legal agreement underlying a swap and is signed by representatives
of the two parties. The drafting of conﬁrmations has been facilitated by the work of the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA; www.isda.org) in New York.
This organization has produced a number of Master Agreements that consist of clauses
deﬁning in some detail the terminology used in swap agreements, what happens in the
event of default by either side, and so on. Master Agreements cover all outstanding
transactions between two parties. In Business Snapshot 7.1, we show a possible extract
from the conﬁrmation for the swap shown in Figure 7.4 between Microsoft and a
ﬁnancial institution (assumed here to be Goldman Sachs). The full conﬁrmation might
state that the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement apply.
The conﬁrmation speciﬁes that the following business day convention is to be used and
that the US calendar determines which days are business days and which days are
holidays. This means that, if a payment date falls on a weekend or a US holiday, the
payment is made on the next business day.4 March 5, 2016, is a Saturday. The payment
scheduled for that day will therefore take place on March 7, 2016.
7.4
THE COMPARATIVE-ADVANTAGE ARGUMENT
An explanation commonly put forward to explain the popularity of swaps concerns
comparative advantage. Consider the use of an interest rate swap to transform a
liability. Some companies, it is argued, have a comparative advantage when borrowing
4 Another business day convention that is sometimes speciﬁed is the modiﬁed following business day
convention, which is the same as the following business day convention except that, when the next business
day falls in a diﬀerent month from the speciﬁed day, the payment is made on the immediately preceding
business day. Preceding and modiﬁed preceding business day conventions are deﬁned analogously.
Swaps

in ﬁxed-rate markets, whereas other companies have a comparative advantage when
borrowing in ﬂoating-rate markets. To obtain a new loan, it makes sense for a company
to go to the market where it has a comparative advantage. As a result, the company
may borrow ﬁxed when it wants ﬂoating, or borrow ﬂoating when it wants ﬁxed. The
swap is used to transform a ﬁxed-rate loan into a ﬂoating-rate loan, and vice versa.
Suppose that two companies, AAACorp and BBBCorp, both wish to borrow
$10 million for 5 years and have been oﬀered the rates shown in Table 7.4. AAACorp
has a AAA credit rating; BBBCorp has a BBB credit rating.5 We assume that BBBCorp

CHAPTER 7

wants to borrow at a ﬁxed rate of interest, whereas AAACorp wants to borrow at a
ﬂoating rate of interest linked to 6-month LIBOR. Because it has a worse credit rating
than AAACorp, BBBCorp pays a higher rate of interest than AAACorp in both ﬁxed
and ﬂoating markets.
A key feature of the rates oﬀered to AAACorp and BBBCorp is that the diﬀerence
between the two ﬁxed rates is greater than the diﬀerence between the two ﬂoating rates.
BBBCorp pays 1.2% more than AAACorp in ﬁxed-rate markets and only 0.7% more
than AAACorp in ﬂoating-rate markets. BBBCorp appears to have a comparative
advantage in ﬂoating-rate markets, whereas AAACorp appears to have a comparative
advantage in ﬁxed-rate markets.6 It is this apparent anomaly that can lead to a swap
being negotiated. AAACorp borrows ﬁxed-rate funds at 4% per annum. BBBCorp
borrows ﬂoating-rate funds at LIBOR plus 0.6% per annum. They then enter into a
swap agreement to ensure that AAACorp ends up with ﬂoating-rate funds and
BBBCorp ends up with ﬁxed-rate funds.
To understand how this swap might work, we ﬁrst assume that AAACorp and
BBBCorp get in touch with each other directly. The sort of swap they might negotiate
is shown in Figure 7.6. This is similar to our example in Figure 7.2. AAACorp agrees to
pay BBBCorp interest at 6-month LIBOR on $10 million. In return, BBBCorp agrees to
pay AAACorp interest at a ﬁxed rate of 4.35% per annum on $10 million.
AAACorp has three sets of interest rate cash ﬂows:
1. It pays 4% per annum to outside lenders.
2. It receives 4.35% per annum from BBBCorp.
3. It pays LIBOR to BBBCorp.
The net eﬀect of the three cash ﬂows is that AAACorp pays LIBOR minus 0.35% per
annum. This is 0.25% per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to ﬂoating-
rate markets. BBBCorp also has three sets of interest rate cash ﬂows:
1. It pays LIBOR þ 0.6% per annum to outside lenders.
2. It receives LIBOR from AAACorp.
3. It pays 4.35% per annum to AAACorp.
The net eﬀect of the three cash ﬂows is that BBBCorp pays 4.95% per annum. This is
0.25% per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to ﬁxed-rate markets.

6 Note that BBBCorp’s comparative advantage in ﬂoating-rate markets does not imply that BBBCorp pays
less than AAACorp in this market. It means that the extra amount that BBBCorp pays over the amount paid
by AAACorp is less in this market. One of my students summarized the situation as follows: ‘‘AAACorp pays
more less in ﬁxed-rate markets; BBBCorp pays less more in ﬂoating-rate markets.’’
Swaps
183

In this example, the swap has been structured so that the net gain to both sides is the
same, 0:25%. This need not be the case. However, the total apparent gain from this
type of interest rate swap arrangement is always a  b, where a is the diﬀerence between
the interest rates facing the two companies in ﬁxed-rate markets, and b is the diﬀerence
between the interest rates facing the two companies in ﬂoating-rate markets. In this
case, a ¼ 1:2% and b ¼ 0:7%, so that the total gain is 0:5%.
If AAACorp and BBBCorp did not deal directly with each other and used a ﬁnancial
institution, an arrangement such as that shown in Figure 7.7 might result. (This is
similar to the example in Figure 7.4.) In this case, AAACorp ends up borrowing at
LIBOR minus 0.33%, BBBCorp ends up borrowing at 4.97%, and the ﬁnancial
institution earns a spread of 4 basis points per year. The gain to AAACorp is 0.23%;
the gain to BBBCorp is 0.23%; and the gain to the ﬁnancial institution is 0.04%. The
total gain to all three parties is 0.50% as before.
Criticism of the Argument
The comparative-advantage argument we have just outlined for explaining the attrac-
tiveness of interest rate swaps is open to question. Why in Table 7.4 should the spreads
between the rates oﬀered to AAACorp and BBBCorp be diﬀerent in ﬁxed and ﬂoating
markets? Now that the interest rate swap market has been in existence for a long time,
we might reasonably expect these types of diﬀerences to have been arbitraged away.
The reason that spread diﬀerentials appear to exist is due to the nature of the
contracts available to companies in ﬁxed and ﬂoating markets. The 4.0% and 5.2%
rates available to AAACorp and BBBCorp in ﬁxed-rate markets are 5-year rates (e.g.,
the rates at which the companies can issue 5-year ﬁxed-rate bonds). The LIBOR  0.1%
and LIBOR þ 0.6% rates available to AAACorp and BBBCorp in ﬂoating-rate markets
are 6-month rates. In the ﬂoating-rate market, the lender usually has the opportunity to
review the ﬂoating rates every 6 months. If the creditworthiness of AAACorp or
BBBCorp has declined, the lender has the option of increasing the spread over LIBOR
that is charged. In extreme circumstances, the lender can refuse to roll over the loan at
all. The providers of ﬁxed-rate ﬁnancing do not have the option to change the terms of
the loan in this way.7
The spreads between the rates oﬀered to AAACorp and BBBCorp are a reﬂection of
the extent to which BBBCorp is more likely than AAACorp to default. During the next
6 months, there is very little chance that either AAACorp or BBBCorp will default. As
we look further ahead, the probability of a default by a company with a relatively low

CHAPTER 7

credit rating (such as BBBCorp) is liable to increase faster than the probability of a
default by a company with a relatively high credit rating (such as AAACorp). This is why
the spread between the 5-year rates is greater than the spread between the 6-month rates.
After negotiating a ﬂoating-rate loan at LIBOR þ 0.6% and entering into the swap
shown in Figure 7.7, BBBCorp appears to obtain a ﬁxed-rate loan at 4.97%. The
arguments just presented show that this is not really the case. In practice, the rate paid
is 4.97% only if BBBCorp can continue to borrow ﬂoating-rate funds at a spread of
0.6% over LIBOR. If, for example, the creditworthiness of BBBCorp declines so that
the ﬂoating-rate loan is rolled over at LIBOR þ 1.6%, the rate paid by BBBCorp
increases to 5.97%. The market expects that BBBCorp’s spread over 6-month LIBOR
will on average rise during the swap’s life. BBBCorp’s expected average borrowing rate
when it enters into the swap is therefore greater than 4.97%.
The swap in Figure 7.7 locks in LIBOR  0.33% for AAACorp for the next 5 years,
not just for the next 6 months. This appears to be a good deal for AAACorp. The
downside is that it is bearing the risk of a default on the swap by the ﬁnancial institution.
If it borrowed ﬂoating-rate funds in the usual way, it would not be bearing this risk.
7.5
THE NATURE OF SWAP RATES
At this stage it is appropriate to examine the nature of swap rates and the relationship
between swap and LIBOR markets. We explained in Section 4.1 that LIBOR is the rate of
interest at which AA-rated banks borrow for periods up to 12 months from other banks.
Also, as indicated in Table 7.3, a swap rate is the average of (a) the ﬁxed rate that a swap
market maker is prepared to pay in exchange for receiving LIBOR (its bid rate) and
(b) the ﬁxed rate that it is prepared to receive in return for paying LIBOR (its oﬀer rate).
Like LIBOR rates, swap rates are not risk-free lending rates. However, they are
reasonably close to risk-free in normal market conditions. A ﬁnancial institution can
earn the 5-year swap rate on a certain principal by doing the following:
1. Lend the principal for the ﬁrst 6 months to a AA borrower and then relend it for
successive 6-month periods to other AA borrowers; and
2. Enter into a swap to exchange the LIBOR income for the 5-year swap rate.
This shows that the 5-year swap rate is an interest rate with a credit risk corresponding
to the situation where 10 consecutive 6-month LIBOR loans to AA companies are
made. Similarly the 7-year swap rate is an interest rate with a credit risk corresponding
to the situation where 14 consecutive 6-month LIBOR loans to AA companies are
made. Swap rates of other maturities can be interpreted analogously.
Note that 5-year swap rates are less than 5-year AA borrowing rates. It is much more
attractive to lend money for successive 6-month periods to borrowers who are always
AA at the beginning of the periods than to lend it to one borrower for the whole 5 years
when all we can be sure of is that the borrower is AA at the beginning of the 5 years.
In discussing the above points, Collin-Dufesne and Solnik refer to swap rates as
‘‘continually refreshed’’ LIBOR rates.8

Market,’’ Journal of Finance, 56, 3 (June 2001).

7.6
DETERMINING LIBOR/SWAP ZERO RATES
One problem with LIBOR rates is that direct observations are possible only for
maturities out to 12 months. As described in Section 6.3, one way of extending the
LIBOR zero curve beyond 12 months is to use Eurodollar futures. Typically Eurodollar
futures are used to produce a LIBOR zero curve out to 2 years—and sometimes out to
as far as 5 years. Traders then use swap rates to extend the LIBOR zero curve further.
The resulting zero curve is sometimes referred to as the LIBOR zero curve and some-
times as the swap zero curve. To avoid any confusion, we will refer to it as the LIBOR/
swap zero curve. We will now describe how swap rates are used in the determination of
the LIBOR/swap zero curve.
The ﬁrst point to note is that the value of a newly issued ﬂoating-rate bond that pays
6-month LIBOR is always equal to its principal value (or par value) when the LIBOR/
swap zero curve is used for discounting.9 The reason is that the bond provides a rate of
interest of LIBOR, and LIBOR is the discount rate. The interest on the bond exactly
matches the discount rate, and as a result the bond is fairly priced at par.
In equation (7.1), we showed that for a newly issued swap where the ﬁxed rate equals
the swap rate, Bﬁx ¼ Bﬂ. We have just argued that Bﬂequals the notional principal. It
follows that Bﬁx also equals the swap’s notional principal. Swap rates therefore deﬁne a set
of par yield bonds. For example, from Table 7.3, we can deduce that the 2-year LIBOR/
swap par yield is 6.045%, the 3-year LIBOR/swap par yield is 6.225%, and so on.10
Section 4.5 showed how the bootstrap method can be used to determine the Treasury
zero curve from Treasury bond prices. It can be used with swap rates in a similar way to
extend the LIBOR/swap zero curve.
Example 7.1
Suppose that the 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month LIBOR/swap zero rates have
been determined as 4%, 4.5%, and 4.8% with continuous compounding and that
the 2-year swap rate (for a swap where payments are made semiannually) is 5%.
This 5% swap rate means that a bond with a principal of $100 and a semiannual
coupon of 5% per annum sells for par. It follows that, if R is the 2-year zero rate,
then
2:5e0:040:5 þ 2:5e0:0451:0 þ 2:5e0:0481:5 þ 102:5e2R ¼ 100
Solving this, we obtain R ¼ 4:953%. (Note that this calculation does not take
day count conventions and holiday calendars into account. See Section 7.2.)
7.7
VALUATION OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS
We now move on to discuss the valuation of interest rate swaps. An interest rate swap is
worth close to zero when it is ﬁrst initiated. After it has been in existence for some time,
its value may be positive or negative. There are two valuation approaches when
9 The same is of course true of a newly issued bond that pays 1-month, 3-month, or 12-month LIBOR.
10 Analysts frequently interpolate between swap rates before calculating the zero curve, so that they have
swap rates for maturities at 6-month intervals. For example, for the data in Table 7.3 the 2.5-year swap rate
would be assumed to be 6.135%; the 7.5-year swap rate would be assumed to be 6.696%; and so on.
186
CHAPTER 7

LIBOR/swap rates are used as discount rates. The ﬁrst regards the swap as the
diﬀerence between two bonds; the second regards it as a portfolio of FRAs. Deriva-
Gem 3.00 can be used to value the swap with either LIBOR or OIS discounting.
Valuation in Terms of Bond Prices
Principal payments are not exchanged in an interest rate swap. However, as illustrated
in Table 7.2, we can assume that principal payments are both received and paid at the
end of the swap without changing its value. By doing this, we ﬁnd that, from the point
of view of the ﬂoating-rate payer, a swap can be regarded as a long position in a ﬁxed-
rate bond and a short position in a ﬂoating-rate bond, so that
Vswap ¼ Bﬁx  Bﬂ
where Vswap is the value of the swap, Bﬂis the value of the ﬂoating-rate bond (corres-
ponding to payments that are made), and Bﬁx is the value of the ﬁxed-rate bond
(corresponding to payments that are received). Similarly, from the point of view of
the ﬁxed-rate payer, a swap is a long position in a ﬂoating-rate bond and a short
position in a ﬁxed-rate bond, so that the value of the swap is
Vswap ¼ Bﬂ Bﬁx
The value of the ﬁxed rate bond, Bﬁx, can be determined as described in Section 4.4. To
value the ﬂoating-rate bond, we note that the bond is worth the notional principal
immediately after a payment. This is because at this time the bond is a ‘‘fair deal’’ where
the borrower pays LIBOR for each subsequent accrual period.
Suppose that the notional principal is L, the next exchange of payments is at time t,
and the ﬂoating payment that will be made at time t (which was determined at the last
payment date) is k. Immediately after the payment Bﬂ¼ L as just explained. It follows
that immediately before the payment Bﬂ¼ L þ k. The ﬂoating-rate bond can therefore
be regarded as an instrument providing a single cash ﬂow of L þ k at time t. Discount-
ing this, the value of the ﬂoating-rate bond today is ðL þ kÞert, where r is the
LIBOR/swap zero rate for a maturity of t. This argument is illustrated in Figure 7.8.

Example 7.2
Suppose that some time ago a ﬁnancial institution agreed to receive 6-month
LIBOR and pay 3% per annum (with semiannual compounding) on a notional
principal of $100 million. The swap has a remaining life of 1.25 years. The
LIBOR rates with continuous compounding for 3-month, 9-month, and 15-
month maturities are 2.8%, 3.2%, and 3.4%, respectively. The 6-month LIBOR
rate at the last payment date was 2.9% (with semiannual compounding).
The calculations for valuing the swap in terms of bonds are summarized in
Table 7.5. The ﬁxed-rate bond has cash ﬂows of 1.5, 1.5, and 101.5 on the three
payment dates. The discount factors for these cash ﬂows are, respectively,
e0:0280:25, e0:0320:75, and e0:0341:25 and are shown in the fourth column
of Table 7.5. The table shows that the value of the ﬁxed-rate bond (in millions of
dollars) is 100.2306.
In this example, L ¼ $100 million, k ¼ 0:5  0:029  100 ¼ $1:4500 million,
and t ¼ 0:25, so that the ﬂoating-rate bond can be valued as though it produces
a cash ﬂow of $101.4500 million in 3 months. The table shows that the value of
the ﬂoating bond (in millions of dollars) is 101:4500  0:9930 ¼ 100:7423.
The value of the swap is the diﬀerence between the two bond prices:
Vswap ¼ 100:7423  100:2306 ¼ 0:5117
or þ0:5117 million dollars.
If the ﬁnancial institution had been in the opposite position of paying ﬁxed
and receiving ﬂoating, the value of the swap would be $0:5117 million. Note
that these calculations do not take account of day count conventions and holi-
day calendars.
Valuation in Terms of FRAs
A swap can be characterized as a portfolio of forward rate agreements. Consider the
swap between Microsoft and Intel in Figure 7.1. The swap is a 3-year deal entered into
on March 5, 2014, with semiannual payments. The ﬁrst exchange of payments is known
at the time the swap is negotiated. The other ﬁve exchanges can be regarded as FRAs.
The exchange on March 5, 2015, is an FRA where interest at 5% is exchanged for
interest at the 6-month rate observed in the market on September 5, 2014; the exchange

on September 5, 2015, is an FRA where interest at 5% is exchanged for interest at the
6-month rate observed in the market on March 5, 2015; and so on.
As shown at the end of Section 4.7, an FRA can be valued by assuming that forward
interest rates are realized. Because it is nothing more than a portfolio of forward rate
agreements, a plain vanilla interest rate swap can also be valued by making the
assumption that forward interest rates are realized. The procedure is as follows:
1. Use the LIBOR/swap zero curve to calculate forward rates for each of the LIBOR
rates that will determine swap cash ﬂows.
2. Calculate swap cash ﬂows on the assumption that the LIBOR rates will equal the
forward rates.
3. Discount these swap cash ﬂows (using the LIBOR/swap zero curve) to obtain the
swap value.
Example 7.3
Consider again the situation in Example 7.2. Under the terms of the swap, a
ﬁnancial institution has agreed to receive 6-month LIBOR and pay 3% per annum
(with semiannual compounding) on a notional principal of $100 million. The swap
has a remaining life of 1.25 years. The LIBOR rates with continuous compound-
ing for 3-month, 9-month, and 15-month maturities are 2.8%, 3.2%, and 3.4%,
respectively. The 6-month LIBOR rate at the last payment date was 2.9% (with
semiannual compounding).
The calculations are summarized in Table 7.6. The ﬁrst row of the table shows the
cash ﬂows that will be exchanged in 3 months. These have already been determined.
The ﬁxed rate of 1.5% will lead to a cash outﬂow of 100  0:030  0:5 ¼
$1:5 million. The ﬂoating rate of 2.9% (which was set 3 months ago) will lead to
a cash inﬂow of 100  0:029  0:5 ¼ $1:45 million. The second row of the table
shows the cash ﬂows that will be exchanged in 9 months assuming that forward
rates are realized. The cash outﬂow is $1.5 million as before. To calculate the cash
inﬂow, we must ﬁrst calculate the forward rate corresponding to the period between
3 and 9 months. From equation (4.5), this is
0:032  0:75  0:028  0:25

¼ 0:034
or 3.4% with continuous compounding. From equation (4.4), the forward rate

ﬂows that will be exchanged in 15 months assuming that forward rates are realized.

of the FRAs corresponding to the exchanges in 9 months and 15 months are
þ$0:2094 and þ$0:3519 million, respectively. The total value of the swap is
þ$0:5117 million. This is in agreement with the value we calculated in Example 7.2
by decomposing the swap into bonds.
7.8
TERM STRUCTURE EFFECTS
A swap is worth close to zero initially. This means that at the outset of a swap the sum
of the values of the FRAs underlying the swap is close to zero. It does not mean that
the value of each individual FRA is close to zero. In general, some FRAs will have
positive values whereas others have negative values.
Consider the FRAs underlying the swap between Microsoft and Intel in Figure 7.1:
Value of FRA to Microsoft > 0 when forward interest rate > 5.0%
Value of FRA to Microsoft ¼ 0 when forward interest rate ¼ 5.0%
Value of FRA to Microsoft < 0 when forward interest rate < 5.0%.
Suppose that the term structure of interest rates is upward-sloping at the time the swap
is negotiated. This means that the forward interest rates increase as the maturity of the
FRA increases. Since the sum of the values of the FRAs is close to zero, the forward
interest rate must be less than 5.0% for the early payment dates and greater than 5.0%
for the later payment dates. The value to Microsoft of the FRAs corresponding to early
payment dates is therefore negative, whereas the value of the FRAs corresponding to
later payment dates is positive. If the term structure of interest rates is downward-
sloping at the time the swap is negotiated, the reverse is true. The impact of the shape of
the term structure of interest rates on the values of the forward contracts underlying a
swap is illustrated in Figure 7.9.
7.9
FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS
Another popular type of swap is known as a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap. This involves
exchanging principal and interest payments at a ﬁxed rate in one currency for principal
and interest payments at a ﬁxed rate in another currency.
A currency swap agreement requires the principal to be speciﬁed in each of the two
currencies. The principal amounts are usually exchanged at the beginning and at the end
of the life of the swap. Usually the principal amounts are chosen to be approximately
equivalent using the exchange rate at the swap’s initiation. When they are exchanged at
the end of the life of the swap, their values may be quite diﬀerent.

CHAPTER 7

Illustration
Consider a hypothetical 5-year currency swap agreement between IBM and British
Petroleum entered into on February 1, 2014. We suppose that IBM pays a ﬁxed rate of
interest of 5% in sterling and receives a ﬁxed rate of interest of 6% in dollars from British
Petroleum. Interest rate payments are made once a year and the principal amounts are
$15 million and £10 million. This is termed a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap because the
interest rate in each currency is at a ﬁxed rate. The swap is shown in Figure 7.10. Initially,

the principal amounts ﬂow in the opposite direction to the arrows in Figure 7.10. The
interest payments during the life of the swap and the ﬁnal principal payment ﬂow in the
same direction as the arrows. Thus, at the outset of the swap, IBM pays $15 million and
receives £10 million. Each year during the life of the swap contract, IBM receives
$0.90 million (¼ 6% of $15 million) and pays £0.50 million (¼ 5% of £10 million). At the
end of the life of the swap, it pays a principal of £10 million and receives a principal of
$15 million. These cash ﬂows are shown in Table 7.7.
Use of a Currency Swap to Transform Liabilities and Assets
A swap such as the one just considered can be used to transform borrowings in one
currency to borrowings in another. Suppose that IBM can issue $15 million of US-
dollar-denominated bonds at 6% interest. The swap has the eﬀect of transforming this
transaction into one where IBM has borrowed £10 million at 5% interest. The initial
exchange of principal converts the proceeds of the bond issue from US dollars to
sterling. The subsequent exchanges in the swap have the eﬀect of swapping the interest
and principal payments from dollars to sterling.
The swap can also be used to transform the nature of assets. Suppose that IBM can
invest £10 million in the UK to yield 5% per annum for the next 5 years, but feels that
the US dollar will strengthen against sterling and prefers a US-dollar-denominated
investment. The swap has the eﬀect of transforming the UK investment into a
$15 million investment in the US yielding 6%.
Comparative Advantage
Currency swaps can be motivated by comparative advantage. To illustrate this, we
consider another hypothetical example. Suppose the 5-year ﬁxed-rate borrowing costs
to General Electric and Qantas Airways in US dollars (USD) and Australian dollars
(AUD) are as shown in Table 7.8. The data in the table suggest that Australian rates are
higher than USD interest rates, and also that General Electric is more creditworthy than
Qantas Airways, because it is oﬀered a more favorable rate of interest in both currencies.
From the viewpoint of a swap trader, the interesting aspect of Table 7.8 is that the
spreads between the rates paid by General Electric and Qantas Airways in the two
markets are not the same. Qantas Airways pays 2% more than General Electric in the
US dollar market and only 0.4% more than General Electric in the AUD market.

CHAPTER 7

This situation is analogous to that in Table 7.4. General Electric has a comparative
advantage in the USD market, whereas Qantas Airways has a comparative advantage
in the AUD market. In Table 7.4, where a plain vanilla interest rate swap was
considered, we argued that comparative advantages are largely illusory. Here we are
comparing the rates oﬀered in two diﬀerent currencies, and it is more likely that the
comparative advantages are genuine. One possible source of comparative advantage is
tax. General Electric’s position might be such that USD borrowings lead to lower taxes
on its worldwide income than AUD borrowings. Qantas Airways’ position might be the
reverse. (Note that we assume that the interest rates shown in Table 7.8 have been
adjusted to reﬂect these types of tax advantages.)
We suppose that General Electric wants to borrow 20 million AUD and Qantas
Airways wants to borrow 18 million USD and that the current exchange rate (USD per
AUD) is 0.9000. This creates a perfect situation for a currency swap. General Electric
and Qantas Airways each borrow in the market where they have a comparative
advantage; that is, General Electric borrows USD whereas Qantas Airways borrows
AUD. They then use a currency swap to transform General Electric’s loan into an
AUD loan and Qantas Airways’ loan into a USD loan.
As already mentioned, the diﬀerence between the USD interest rates is 2%, whereas
the diﬀerence between the AUD interest rates is 0.4%. By analogy with the interest rate
swap case, we expect the total gain to all parties to be 2:0  0:4 ¼ 1:6% per annum.
There are several ways in which the swap can be arranged. Figure 7.11 shows one way
swaps might be entered into with a ﬁnancial institution. General Electric borrows USD
and Qantas Airways borrows AUD. The eﬀect of the swap is to transform the USD
interest rate of 5% per annum to an AUD interest rate of 6.9% per annum for General
Electric. As a result, General Electric is 0.7% per annum better oﬀthan it would be if it
went directly to AUD markets. Similarly, Qantas exchanges an AUD loan at 8% per
annum for a USD loan at 6.3% per annum and ends up 0.7% per annum better oﬀ
than it would be if it went directly to USD markets. The ﬁnancial institution gains
1.3% per annum on its USD cash ﬂows and loses 1.1% per annum on its AUD ﬂows. If
we ignore the diﬀerence between the two currencies, the ﬁnancial institution makes a

net gain of 0.2% per annum. As predicted, the total gain to all parties is 1.6% per
annum.
Each year the ﬁnancial institution makes a gain of USD 234,000 (¼ 1:3% of
18 million) and incurs a loss of AUD 220,000 (¼ 1:1% of 20 million). The ﬁnancial
institution can avoid any foreign exchange risk by buying AUD 220,000 per annum in
the forward market for each year of the life of the swap, thus locking in a net gain
in USD.
It is possible to redesign the swap so that the ﬁnancial institution makes a 0.2%
spread in USD. Figures 7.12 and 7.13 present two alternatives. These alternatives are
unlikely to be used in practice because they do not lead to General Electric and Qantas
being free of foreign exchange risk.11 In Figure 7.12, Qantas bears some foreign
exchange risk because it pays 1.1% per annum in AUD and pays 5.2% per annum
in USD. In Figure 7.13, General Electric bears some foreign exchange risk because it
receives 1.1% per annum in USD and pays 8% per annum in AUD.

VALUATION OF FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS
Like interest rate swaps, ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swaps can be decomposed into either
the diﬀerence between two bonds or a portfolio of forward contracts.

foreign cash ﬂows on the swap and BD is the value of the bond deﬁned by the domestic
cash ﬂows on the swap, and S0 is the spot exchange rate (expressed as number of dollars
per unit of foreign currency). The value of a swap can therefore be determined from
interest rates in the two currencies and the spot exchange rate.
Similarly, the value of a swap where the foreign currency is received and dollars are
paid is
Vswap ¼ S0BF  BD
Example 7.4
Suppose that the term structure of interest rates is ﬂat in both Japan and the
United States. The Japanese rate is 4% per annum and the US rate is 9% per
annum (both with continuous compounding). Some time ago a ﬁnancial institu-
tion has entered into a currency swap in which it receives 5% per annum in yen
and pays 8% per annum in dollars once a year. The principals in the two cur-
rencies are $10 million and 1,200 million yen. The swap will last for another
3 years, and the current exchange rate is 110 yen ¼ $1.
The calculations are summarized in Table 7.9. In this case, the cash ﬂows from
the dollar bond underlying the swap are as shown in the second column. The
present value of the cash ﬂows using the dollar discount rate of 9% are shown in
the third column. The cash ﬂows from the yen bond underlying the swap are
shown in the fourth column of the table. The present value of the cash ﬂows using
the yen discount rate of 4% are shown in the ﬁnal column of the table.
The value of the dollar bond, BD, is 9.6439 million dollars. The value of the yen
bond is 1230.55 million yen. The value of the swap in dollars is therefore

Valuation as Portfolio of Forward Contracts
Each exchange of payments in a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap is a forward foreign
exchange contract. In Section 5.7, forward foreign exchange contracts were valued by
assuming that forward exchange rates are realized. The same assumption can therefore
be made for a currency swap.

Example 7.5
Consider again the situation in Example 7.4. The term structure of interest rates is
ﬂat in both Japan and the United States. The Japanese rate is 4% per annum and
the US rate is 9% per annum (both with continuous compounding). Some time ago
a ﬁnancial institution has entered into a currency swap in which it receives 5% per
annum in yen and pays 8% per annum in dollars once a year. The principals in the
two currencies are $10 million and 1,200 million yen. The swap will last for another
3 years, and the current exchange rate is 110 yen ¼ $1.
The calculations are summarized in Table 7.10. The ﬁnancial institution pays
0:08  10 ¼ $0:8 million dollars and receives 1,200  0:05 ¼ 60 million yen each
year. In addition, the dollar principal of $10 million is paid and the yen principal
of 1,200 is received at the end of year 3. The current spot rate is 0.009091 dollar
per yen. In this case r ¼ 9% and rf ¼ 4%, so that, from equation (5.9), the 1-year
forward rate is
0:009091 eð0:090:04Þ1 ¼ 0:009557
The 2- and 3-year forward rates in Table 7.10 are calculated similarly. The for-
ward contracts underlying the swap can be valued by assuming that the forward
rates are realized. If the 1-year forward rate is realized, the yen cash ﬂow in year 1
is worth 60  0:009557 ¼ 0:5734 million dollars and the net cash ﬂow at the end
of year 1 is 0:5734  0:8 ¼ 0:2266 million dollars. This has a present value of
0:2266 e0:091 ¼ 0:2071
million dollars. This is the value of forward contract corresponding to the exchange
of cash ﬂows at the end of year 1. The value of the other forward contracts are
calculated similarly. As shown in Table 7.10, the total value of the forward con-
tracts is $1.5430 million. This agrees with the value calculated for the swap in
Example 7.4 by decomposing it into bonds.
The value of a currency swap is normally close to zero initially. If the two principals
are worth the same at the start of the swap, the value of the swap is also close to zero
immediately after the initial exchange of principal. However, as in the case of interest
rate swaps, this does not mean that each of the individual forward contracts underlying
the swap has a value close to zero. It can be shown that, when interest rates in two
currencies are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, the payer of the currency with the high interest

rate is in the position where the forward contracts corresponding to the early exchanges
of cash ﬂows have negative values, and the forward contract corresponding to ﬁnal
exchange of principals has a positive value. The payer of the currency with the low
interest rate is in the opposite position; that is, the forward contracts corresponding to
the early exchanges of cash ﬂows have positive values, while that corresponding to the
ﬁnal exchange has a negative value. These results are important when the credit risk in
the swap is being evaluated.
7.11
OTHER CURRENCY SWAPS
Two other popular currency swaps are:
1. Fixed-for-ﬂoating where a ﬂoating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a
ﬁxed interest rate in another currency
2. Floating-for-ﬂoating where a ﬂoating interest rate in one currency is exchanged
for a ﬂoating interest rate in another currency.
An example of the ﬁrst type of swap would be an exchange where sterling LIBOR on a
principal of £7 million is paid and 3% on a principal of $10 million is received with
payments being made semiannually for 10 years. Similarly to a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency
swap, this would involve an initial exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the
interest payments and a ﬁnal exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest
payments at the end of the swap’s life. A ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating swap can be regarded as a
portfolio consisting of a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap and a ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating interest
rate swap. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where
3% on a principal of $10 million is received and (say) 4% on a principal of £7 million is
paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where 4% is received and LIBOR is paid on a
notional principal of £7 million.
To value the swap we are considering, we can calculate the value of the dollar payments
in dollars by discounting them at the dollar risk-free rate. We can calculate the value of
the sterling payments by assuming that sterling LIBOR forward rates will be realized and
discounting the cash ﬂows at the sterling risk-free rate. The value of the swap is the
diﬀerence between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.
An example of the second type of swap would be the exchange where sterling LIBOR
on a principal of £7 million is paid and dollar LIBOR on a principal of $10 million is
received. As in the other cases we have considered, this would involve an initial
exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a ﬁnal
exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the
swap’s life. A ﬂoating-for-ﬂoating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a
ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap and two interest rate swaps, one in each currency. For
instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where (say) 3% on a
principal of $10 million is received and (say) 4% on a principal of £7 million is paid
plus (b) an interest rate swap where 4% is received and LIBOR is paid on a notional
principal of £7 million plus (c) an interest rate swap where 3% is paid and LIBOR is
received on a notional principal of $10 million.
A ﬂoating-for-ﬂoating swap can be valued by assuming that forward interest rates in
each currency will be realized and discounting the cash ﬂows at risk-free rates. The
Swaps
197

value of the swap is the diﬀerence between the values of the two sets of payments using
current exchange rates.
7.12
CREDIT RISK
Transactions such as swaps that are private arrangements between two companies entail
credit risks. Consider a ﬁnancial institution that has entered into oﬀsetting transactions
with two companies (see Figure 7.4, 7.5, or 7.7). If neither party defaults, the ﬁnancial
institution remains fully hedged. A decline in the value of one transaction will always be
oﬀset by an increase in the value of the other transaction. However, there is a chance
that one party will get into ﬁnancial diﬃculties and default. The ﬁnancial institution
then still has to honor the contract it has with the other party.
Suppose that, some time after the initiation of the transactions in Figure 7.4, the
transaction with Microsoft has a positive value to the ﬁnancial institution, whereas the
transaction with Intel has a negative value. Suppose further that the ﬁnancial institution
has no other derivatives transactions with these companies and that no collateral is
posted. (The impact of netting in portfolios and collateral agreements will be discussed
in Chapter 24.) If Microsoft defaults, the ﬁnancial institution is liable to lose the whole
of the positive value it has in this transaction. To maintain a hedged position, it would
have to ﬁnd a third party willing to take Microsoft’s position. To induce the third party
to take the position, the ﬁnancial institution would have to pay the third party an
amount roughly equal to the value of its contract with Microsoft prior to the default.
A ﬁnancial institution clearly has credit-risk exposure from a swap when the value of
the swap to the ﬁnancial institution is positive. What happens when this value is
negative and the counterparty gets into ﬁnancial diﬃculties? In theory, the ﬁnancial
institution could realize a windfall gain, because a default would lead to it getting rid of
a liability. In practice, it is likely that the counterparty would choose to sell the
transaction to a third party or rearrange its aﬀairs in some way so that its positive
value in the transaction is not lost. The most realistic assumption for the ﬁnancial
institution is therefore as follows. If the counterparty goes bankrupt, there will be a loss
if the value of the swap to the ﬁnancial institution is positive, and there will be no eﬀect
on the ﬁnancial institution’s position if the value of the swap to the ﬁnancial institution
is negative. This situation is summarized in Figure 7.14.

CHAPTER 7

In swaps, it is sometimes the case that the early exchanges of cash ﬂows have positive
values and the later exchanges have negative values. (This would be true in Figure 7.9a
and in a currency swap where the currency with the lower interest rate is paid.) These
swaps are likely to have negative values for most of their lives and therefore entail less
credit risk than swaps where the reverse is true.
Potential losses from defaults on a swap are much less than the potential losses from
defaults on a loan with the same principal. This is because the value of the swap is
usually only a small fraction of the value of the loan. Potential losses from defaults on a
currency swap are greater than on an interest rate swap. The reason is that, because
principal amounts in two diﬀerent currencies are exchanged at the end of the life of a
currency swap, a currency swap is liable to have a greater value at the time of a default
than an interest rate swap.
It is important to distinguish between the credit risk and market risk to a ﬁnancial
institution in any contract. As discussed earlier, the credit risk arises from the
possibility of a default by the counterparty when the value of the contract to the
ﬁnancial institution is positive. The market risk arises from the possibility that market
variables such as interest rates and exchange rates will move in such a way that the value
of a contract to the ﬁnancial institution becomes negative. Market risks can be hedged
relatively easily by entering into oﬀsetting contracts; credit risks are less easy to hedge.
One of the more bizarre stories in swap markets is outlined in Business Snapshot 7.2. It
concerns the British Local Authority Hammersmith and Fulham and shows that, in
addition to bearing market risk and credit risk, banks trading swaps also sometimes bear
legal risk.
Business Snapshot 7.2
The Hammersmith and Fulham Story
Between 1987 to 1989 the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in the UK
entered into about 600 interest rate swaps and related instruments with a total notional
principal of about 6 billion pounds. The transactions appear to have been entered into
for speculative rather than hedging purposes. The two employees of Hammersmith
and Fulham responsible for the trades had only a sketchy understanding of the risks
they were taking and how the products they were trading worked.
By 1989, because of movements in sterling interest rates, Hammersmith and
Fulham had lost several hundred million pounds on the swaps. To the banks on
the other side of the transactions, the swaps were worth several hundred million
pounds. The banks were concerned about credit risk. They had entered into oﬀ-
setting swaps to hedge their interest rate risks. If Hammersmith and Fulham
defaulted, the banks would still have to honor their obligations on the oﬀsetting
swaps and would take a huge loss.
What happened was something a little diﬀerent from a default. Hammersmith and
Fulham’s auditor asked to have the transactions declared void because Hammersmith
and Fulham did not have the authority to enter into the transactions. The British
courts agreed. The case was appealed and went all the way to the House of Lords,
Britain’s highest court. The ﬁnal decision was that Hammersmith and Fulham did
not have the authority to enter into the swaps, but that they ought to have the
authority to do so in the future for risk-management purposes. Needless to say,
banks were furious that their contracts were overturned in this way by the courts.
Swaps
199

Central Clearing
As explained in Chapter 2, in an attempt to reduce credit risk in over-the-counter
markets, regulators require standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be cleared
through central counterparties (CCPs). The CCP acts as an intermediary between the
two sides in a transaction. It requires initial margin and variation margin from both
sides in the same way that these are required by futures clearing houses. LCH.Clearnet
(formed by a merger of the London Clearing House and Paris-based Clearnet) is the
largest CCP for interest rate swaps. It was clearing swaps with over $350 trillion of
notional principal in 2013.
Credit Default Swaps
A swap which has grown in importance since the year 2000 is a credit default swap
(CDS). This is a swap that allows companies to hedge credit risks in the same way that
they have hedged market risks for many years. A CDS is like an insurance contract that
pays oﬀif a particular company or country defaults. The company or country is known
as the reference entity. The buyer of credit protection pays an insurance premium,
known as the CDS spread, to the seller of protection for the life of the contract or until
the reference entity defaults. Suppose that the notional principal of the CDS is
$100 million and the CDS spread for a 5-year deal is 120 basis points. The insurance
premium would be 120 basis points applied to $100 million or $1.2 million per year. If
the reference entity does not default during the 5 years, nothing is received in return for
the insurance premiums. If reference entity does default and bonds issued by the
reference entity are worth 40 cents per dollar of principal immediately after default,
the seller of protection has to make a payment to the buyer of protection equal to
$60 million. The idea here is that, if the buyer of protection owned a portfolio of bonds
issued by the reference entity with a principal of $100 million, the payoﬀwould be
suﬃcient to bring the value of the portfolio back up to $100 million.
Credit default swaps are discussed in more detail in Chapter 25.
7.13
OTHER TYPES OF SWAPS
In this chapter, we have covered interest rate swaps where LIBOR is exchanged for a ﬁxed
rate of interest and currency swaps where interest in one currency is exchanged for interest
in another currency. Many other types of swaps are traded. We will discuss some of them
in detail in Chapters 25, 30, and 33. At this stage, we will provide an overview.
Variations on the Standard Interest Rate Swap
In ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating interest rate swaps, LIBOR is the most common reference ﬂoating
interest rate. In the examples in this chapter, the tenor (i.e., payment frequency) of
LIBOR has been 6 months, but swaps where the tenor of LIBOR is 1 month, 3 months,
and 12 months trade regularly. The tenor on the ﬂoating side does not have to match
the tenor on the ﬁxed side. (Indeed, as pointed out in footnote 3, the standard interest
rate swap in the United States is one where there are quarterly LIBOR payments and
semiannual ﬁxed payments.) LIBOR is the most common ﬂoating rate, but others such
as the commercial paper (CP) rate are occasionally used. Sometimes what are known as
200
CHAPTER 7

basis swaps are negotiated. For example, the 3-month CP rate plus 10 basis points might
be exchanged for 3-month LIBOR with both being applied to the same principal. (This
deal would allow a company to hedge its exposure when assets and liabilities are subject
to diﬀerent ﬂoating rates.)
The principal in a swap agreement can be varied throughout the term of the swap to
meet the needs of a counterparty. In an amortizing swap, the principal reduces in a
predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to the amortization schedule
on a loan.) In a step-up swap, the principal increases in a predetermined way. (This
might be designed to correspond to drawdowns on a loan agreement.) Deferred swaps
or forward swaps, where the parties do not begin to exchange interest payments until
some future date, can also be arranged. Sometimes swaps are negotiated where the
principal to which the ﬁxed payments are applied is diﬀerent from the principal to
which the ﬂoating payments are applied.
A constant maturity swap (CMS swap) is an agreement to exchange a LIBOR rate for
a swap rate. An example would be an agreement to exchange 6-month LIBOR applied
to a certain principal for the 10-year swap rate applied to the same principal every
6 months for the next 5 years. A constant maturity Treasury swap (CMT swap) is a
similar agreement to exchange a LIBOR rate for a particular Treasury rate (e.g., the
10-year Treasury rate).
In a compounding swap, interest on one or both sides is compounded forward to the
end of the life of the swap according to preagreed rules and there is only one payment
date at the end of the life of the swap. In a LIBOR-in arrears swap, the LIBOR rate
observed on a payment date is used to calculate the payment on that date. (As
explained in Section 7.1, in a standard deal the LIBOR rate observed on one payment
date is used to determine the payment on the next payment date.) In an accrual swap,
the interest on one side of the swap accrues only when the ﬂoating reference rate is in a
certain range.
Diff Swaps
Sometimes a rate observed in one currency is applied to a principal amount in another
currency. One such deal might be where 3-month LIBOR observed in the United States
is exchanged for 3-month LIBOR in Britain, with both rates being applied to a
principal of 10 million British pounds. This type of swap is referred to as a diﬀswap
or a quanto and will be discussed in Chapter 30.
Equity Swaps
An equity swap is an agreement to exchange the total return (dividends and capital gains)
realized on an equity index for either a ﬁxed or a ﬂoating rate of interest. For example, the
total return on the S&P 500 in successive 6-month periods might be exchanged for
LIBOR, with both being applied to the same principal. Equity swaps can be used by
portfolio managers to convert returns from a ﬁxed or ﬂoating investment to the returns
from investing in an equity index, and vice versa. They are discussed in Chapter 33.
Options
Sometimes there are options embedded in a swap agreement. For example, in an
extendable swap, one party has the option to extend the life of the swap beyond the
Swaps
201

speciﬁed period. In a puttable swap, one party has the option to terminate the swap
early. Options on swaps, or swaptions, are also available. These provide one party with
the right at a future time to enter into a swap where a predetermined ﬁxed rate is
exchanged for ﬂoating and are discussed in Chapter 29.
Commodity Swaps, Volatility Swaps, and Other Exotic Instruments
Commodity swaps are in essence a series of forward contracts on a commodity with
diﬀerent maturity dates and the same delivery prices. In a volatility swap there are a
series of time periods. At the end of each period, one side pays a preagreed volatility,
while the other side pays the historical volatility realized during the period. Both
volatilities are multiplied by the same notional principal in calculating payments.
Volatility swaps are discussed in Chapter 26.
Swaps are limited only by the imagination of ﬁnancial engineers and the desire of
corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures. In Chapter 33, we will
describe the famous 5/30 swap entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers
Trust, where payments depended in a complex way on the 30-day commercial paper
rate, a 30-year Treasury bond price, and the yield on a 5-year Treasury bond.
SUMMARY
The two most common types of swaps are interest rate swaps and currency swaps. In an
interest rate swap, one party agrees to pay the other party interest at a ﬁxed rate on a
notional principal for a number of years. In return, it receives interest at a ﬂoating rate
on the same notional principal for the same period of time. In a currency swap, one
party agrees to pay interest on a principal amount in one currency. In return, it receives
interest on a principal amount in another currency.
Principal amounts are not usually exchanged in an interest rate swap. In a currency
swap, principal amounts are usually exchanged at both the beginning and the end of the
life of the swap. For a party paying interest in the foreign currency, the foreign principal
is received, and the domestic principal is paid at the beginning of the swap’s life. At the
end of the swap’s life, the foreign principal is paid and the domestic principal is
received.
An interest rate swap can be used to transform a ﬂoating-rate loan into a ﬁxed-rate
loan, or vice versa. It can also be used to transform a ﬂoating-rate investment to a ﬁxed-
rate investment, or vice versa. A currency swap can be used to transform a loan in one
currency into a loan in another currency. It can also be used to transform an investment
denominated in one currency into an investment denominated in another currency.
There are two ways of valuing interest rate and currency swaps. In the ﬁrst, the swap
is decomposed into a long position in one bond and a short position in another bond.
In the second it is regarded as a portfolio of forward contracts.
When a ﬁnancial institution enters into a pair of oﬀsetting swaps with diﬀerent
counterparties, it is exposed to credit risk. If one of the counterparties defaults when
the ﬁnancial institution has positive value in its swap with that counterparty, the
ﬁnancial institution is liable to lose money because it still has to honor its swap
agreement with the other counterparty. Counterparty risk, collateral, and the impact
of netting are discussed in Chapter 24.

Practice Questions (Answers in Solutions Manual)
7.1. Companies A and B have been oﬀered the following rates per annum on a $20 million
5-year loan:
Fixed rate
Floating rate
Company A :
5.0%
LIBOR þ 0.1%
Company B :
6.4%
LIBOR þ 0.6%
Company A requires a ﬂoating-rate loan; company B requires a ﬁxed-rate loan. Design a
swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 0.1% per annum and that will appear
equally attractive to both companies.
7.2. Company X wishes to borrow US dollars at a ﬁxed rate of interest. Company Y wishes to
borrow Japanese yen at a ﬁxed rate of interest. The amounts required by the two
companies are roughly the same at the current exchange rate. The companies are subject
to the following interest rates, which have been adjusted to reﬂect the impact of taxes:
Yen
Dollars
Company X :
5.0%
9.6%
Company Y :
6.5%
10.0%
Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 50 basis points per annum.
Make the swap equally attractive to the two companies and ensure that all foreign
exchange risk is assumed by the bank.
7.3. A $100 million interest rate swap has a remaining life of 10 months. Under the terms of the
swap, 6-month LIBOR is exchanged for 7% per annum (compounded semiannually). The
average of the bid–oﬀer rate being exchanged for 6-month LIBOR in swaps of all
maturities is currently 5% per annum with continuous compounding. The 6-month LIBOR
rate was 4.6% per annum 2 months ago. What is the current value of the swap to the party
paying ﬂoating? What is its value to the party paying ﬁxed?
7.4. Explain what a swap rate is. What is the relationship between swap rates and par
yields?
Swaps
203

7.5. A currency swap has a remaining life of 15 months. It involves exchanging interest
at 10% on £20 million for interest at 6% on $30 million once a year. The term structure
of interest rates in both the United Kingdom and the United States is currently ﬂat,
and if the swap were negotiated today the interest rates exchanged would be 4% in
dollars and 7% in sterling. All interest rates are quoted with annual compounding. The
current exchange rate (dollars per pound sterling) is 1.5500. What is the value of the
swap to the party paying sterling? What is the value of the swap to the party paying
dollars?
7.6. Explain the diﬀerence between the credit risk and the market risk in a ﬁnancial contract.
7.7. A corporate treasurer tells you that he has just negotiated a 5-year loan at a competitive
ﬁxed rate of interest of 5.2%. The treasurer explains that he achieved the 5.2% rate by
borrowing at 6-month LIBOR plus 150 basis points and swapping LIBOR for 3.7%. He
goes on to say that this was possible because his company has a comparative advantage in
the ﬂoating-rate market. What has the treasurer overlooked?
7.8. Explain why a bank is subject to credit risk when it enters into two oﬀsetting swap
contracts.
7.9. Companies X and Y have been oﬀered the following rates per annum on a $5 million
10-year investment:
Fixed rate
Floating rate
Company X :
8.0%
LIBOR
Company Y :
8.8%
LIBOR
Company X requires a ﬁxed-rate investment; company Y requires a ﬂoating-rate invest-
ment. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 0.2% per annum and
will appear equally attractive to X and Y.
7.10. A ﬁnancial institution has entered into an interest rate swap with company X. Under the
terms of the swap, it receives 10% per annum and pays 6-month LIBOR on a principal of
$10 million for 5 years. Payments are made every 6 months. Suppose that company X
defaults on the sixth payment date (at the end of year 3) when the LIBOR/swap interest rate
(with semiannual compounding) is 8% per annum for all maturities. What is the loss to the
ﬁnancial institution? Assume that 6-month LIBOR was 9% per annum halfway through
year 3.
7.11. Companies A and B face the following interest rates (adjusted for the diﬀerential impact
of taxes):
Company A
Company B
US dollars (ﬂoating rate) :
LIBOR þ 0.5%
LIBOR þ 1.0%
Canadian dollars (ﬁxed rate) :
5.0%
6.5%
Assume that A wants to borrow US dollars at a ﬂoating rate of interest and B wants to
borrow Canadian dollars at a ﬁxed rate of interest. A ﬁnancial institution is planning to
arrange a swap and requires a 50-basis-point spread. If the swap is to appear equally
attractive to A and B, what rates of interest will A and B end up paying?
7.12. A ﬁnancial institution has entered into a 10-year currency swap with company Y. Under
the terms of the swap, the ﬁnancial institution receives interest at 3% per annum in Swiss
francs and pays interest at 8% per annum in US dollars. Interest payments are exchanged
204
CHAPTER 7

once a year. The principal amounts are 7 million dollars and 10 million francs. Suppose
that company Y declares bankruptcy at the end of year 6, when the exchange rate is $0.80
per franc. What is the cost to the ﬁnancial institution? Assume that, at the end of year 6,
the interest rate is 3% per annum in Swiss francs and 8% per annum in US dollars for all
maturities. All interest rates are quoted with annual compounding.
7.13. After it hedges its foreign exchange risk using forward contracts, is the ﬁnancial
institution’s average spread in Figure 7.11 likely to be greater than or less than 20 basis
points? Explain your answer.
7.14. ‘‘Companies with high credit risks are the ones that cannot access ﬁxed-rate markets
directly. They are the companies that are most likely to be paying ﬁxed and receiving
ﬂoating in an interest rate swap.’’ Assume that this statement is true. Do you think it
increases or decreases the risk of a ﬁnancial institution’s swap portfolio? Assume that
companies are most likely to default when interest rates are high.
7.15. Why is the expected loss from a default on a swap less than the expected loss from the
default on a loan to the same counterparty with the same principal?
7.16. A bank ﬁnds that its assets are not matched with its liabilities. It is taking ﬂoating-rate
deposits and making ﬁxed-rate loans. How can swaps be used to oﬀset the risk?
7.17. Explain how you would value a swap that is the exchange of a ﬂoating rate in one
currency for a ﬁxed rate in another currency.
7.18. The LIBOR zero curve is ﬂat at 5% (continuously compounded) out to 1.5 years. Swap
rates for 2- and 3-year semiannual pay swaps are 5.4% and 5.6%, respectively. Estimate
the LIBOR zero rates for maturities of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 years. (Assume that the 2.5-year
swap rate is the average of the 2- and 3-year swap rates.)
7.19. How would you measure the dollar duration of a swap?

6.45%. What ﬂoating rate can it swap this ﬁxed rate into?
(b) Company B has been oﬀered the rates shown in Table 7.3. It can borrow for 5 years at
LIBOR plus 75 basis points. What ﬁxed rate can it swap this ﬂoating rate into?

LIBOR minus 50 basis points. What ﬁxed rate can it swap this ﬂoating rate into?
7.22. The 1-year LIBOR rate is 10% with annual compounding. A bank trades swaps where a
ﬁxed rate of interest is exchanged for 12-month LIBOR with payments being exchanged
annually. The 2- and 3-year swap rates (expressed with annual compounding) are 11%
and 12% per annum. Estimate the 2- and 3-year LIBOR zero rates.
7.23. Under the terms of an interest rate swap, a ﬁnancial institution has agreed to pay 10% per
annum and to receive 3-month LIBOR in return on a notional principal of $100 million
with payments being exchanged every 3 months. The swap has a remaining life of
14 months. The average of the bid and oﬀer ﬁxed rates currently being swapped for
3-month LIBOR is 12% per annum for all maturities. The 3-month LIBOR rate 1 month

interest. They have been quoted the following rates per annum (adjusted for diﬀerential
tax eﬀects):
Sterling

Company B
10.6%
6.2%
Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 10 basis points per annum and
that will produce a gain of 15 basis points per annum for each of the two companies.
7.25. Suppose that the term structure of interest rates is ﬂat in the United States and Australia.
The USD interest rate is 7% per annum and the AUD rate is 9% per annum. The current
value of the AUD is 0.62 USD. Under the terms of a swap agreement, a ﬁnancial

principals in the two currencies are $12 million USD and 20 million AUD. Payments
are exchanged every year, with one exchange having just taken place. The swap will last
2 more years. What is the value of the swap to the ﬁnancial institution? Assume all
interest rates are continuously compounded.

ﬁxed rate of interest for 5 years in US funds. Because the company is not well known in
the United States, this has proved to be impossible. However, the company has been
quoted 12% per annum on ﬁxed-rate 5-year sterling funds. Company Y is based in the
United States and would like to borrow the equivalent of $50 million in sterling funds for
5 years at a ﬁxed rate of interest. It has been unable to get a quote but has been oﬀered
US dollar funds at 10.5% per annum. Five-year government bonds currently yield
9.5% per annum in the United States and 10.5% in the United Kingdom. Suggest an
appropriate currency swap that will net the ﬁnancial intermediary 0.5% per annum.

CHAPTER 7

Securitization
and the Credit
Crisis of 2007
Derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options are concerned with transfer-
ring risk from one entity in the economy to another. The ﬁrst seven chapters of this
book have focused on forwards, futures, and swaps. Before moving on to discuss
options, we consider another important way of transferring risk in the economy:
securitization.
Securitization is of particular interest because of its role in the credit crisis (sometimes
referred to as the ‘‘credit crunch’’) that started in 2007. The crisis had its origins in
ﬁnancial products created from mortgages in the United States, but rapidly spread from
the United States to other countries and from ﬁnancial markets to the real economy.
Some ﬁnancial institutions failed; others had to be rescued by national governments.
There can be no question that the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century was disastrous
for the ﬁnancial sector.
In this chapter, we examine the nature of securitization and its role in the crisis. In
the course of the chapter, we will learn about the US mortgage market, asset-backed
securities, collateralized debt obligations, waterfalls, and the importance of incentives in
ﬁnancial markets.
8.1
SECURITIZATION
Traditionally, banks have funded their loans primarily from deposits. In the 1960s, US
banks found that they could not keep pace with the demand for residential mortgages
with this type of funding. This led to the development of the mortgage-backed security
(MBS) market. Portfolios of mortgages were created and the cash ﬂows (interest and
principal payments) generated by the portfolios were packaged as securities (i.e., securi-
tized) and sold to investors. The US government created the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae) in 1968. This organization
guaranteed (for a fee) interest and principal payments on qualifying mortgages and
created the securities that were sold to investors.
Thus, although banks originated the mortgages, they did not keep them on their
balance sheets. Securitization allowed them to increase their lending faster than their
207

deposits were growing. GNMA’s guarantee protected MBS investors against defaults
by borrowers.1
In the 1980s, the securitization techniques developed for the mortgage market were
applied to asset classes such as automobile loans and credit card receivables in the
United States. Securitization also become popular in other parts of the world. As the
securitization market developed, investors became comfortable with situations where
they did not have a guarantee against defaults by borrowers.
ABSs
A securitization arrangement of the type used during the 2000 to 2007 period is shown
in Figure 8.1. This is known as an asset-backed security or ABS. A portfolio of income-
producing assets such as loans is sold by the originating banks to a special purpose
vehicle (SPV) and the cash ﬂows from the assets are then allocated to tranches.
Figure 8.1 is simpler than the structures that were typically created because it has only
three tranches (in practice, many more tranches were used). These are the senior
tranche, the mezzanine tranche, and the equity tranche. The portfolio has a principal
of $100 million. This is divided as follows: $80 million to the senior tranche, $15 million
to the mezzanine tranche, and $5 million to the equity tranche. The senior tranche is
promised a return of LIBOR plus 60 basis points, the mezzanine tranche is promised a
return of LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and the equity tranche is promised a return of
LIBOR plus 2,000 basis points.

1 However, MBS investors do face uncertainty about mortgage prepayments. Prepayments tend to be
greatest when interest rates are low and the reinvestment opportunities open to investors are not particularly
attractive. In the early days of MBSs, many MBS investors realized lower returns than they expected because
they did not take this into account.
208
CHAPTER 8

It sounds as though the equity tranche has the best deal, but this is not necessarily the
case. The payments of interest and principal are not guaranteed. The equity tranche is
more likely to lose part of its principal, and less likely to receive the promised interest
payments on its outstanding principal, than the other tranches. Cash ﬂows are allocated
to tranches by specifying what is known as a waterfall. The general way a waterfall works
is illustrated in Figure 8.2. A separate waterfall is applied to principal and interest
payments. Principal payments are allocated to the senior tranche until its principal
has been fully repaid. They are then allocated to mezzanine tranche until its principal has
been fully repaid. Only after this has happened do principal repayments go to the equity
tranche. Interest payments are allocated to the senior tranche until the senior tranche has
received its promised return on its outstanding principal. Assuming that this promised
return can be made, interest payments are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche. If the
promised return to the mezzanine tranche can be made and cash ﬂows are left over, they
are allocated to the equity tranche.
The extent to which the tranches get their principal back depends on losses on the
underlying assets. The eﬀect of the waterfall is roughly as follows. The ﬁrst 5% of losses
are borne by the equity tranche. If losses exceed 5%, the equity tranche loses all its
principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the mezzanine tranche. If losses
exceed 20%, the mezzanine tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by
the principal of the senior tranche.
There are therefore two ways of looking at an ABS. One is with reference to the
waterfall in Figure 8.2. Cash ﬂows go ﬁrst to the senior tranche, then to the mezzanine
tranche, and then to the equity tranche. The other is in terms of losses. Losses of principal
are ﬁrst borne by the equity tranche, then by the mezzanine tranche, and then by the
senior tranche. Rating agencies such as Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch played a key role in
securitization. The ABS in Figure 8.1 is likely to be designed so that the senior tranche is
given the highest possible rating, AAA. The mezzanine tranche is typically rated BBB
(well below AAA, but still investment grade). The equity tranche is typically unrated.
The description of ABSs that we have given so far is somewhat simpliﬁed. Typically,
more than three tranches with a wide range of ratings were created. In the waterfall

rules, as we have described them, the allocation of cash ﬂows to tranches is sequential in
that they always ﬂow ﬁrst to the most senior tranche, then to the next most senior
tranche, and so on. In practice, the rules are somewhat more complicated than this and
are described in a legal document that is several hundred pages long. Another
complication is that there was often some overcollateralization where the total principal
of the tranches was less than the total principal of the underlying assets. Also, the
weighted average return promised to the tranches was less than the weighted average
return payable on the assets.2
ABS CDOs
Finding investors to buy the senior AAA-rated tranches of ABSs was usually not
diﬃcult, because the tranches promised returns that were very attractive when compared
with the return on AAA-rated bonds. Equity tranches were typically retained by the
originator of the assets or sold to a hedge fund.
Finding investors for mezzanine tranches was more diﬃcult. This led to the creation of
ABSs of ABSs. The way this was done is shown in Figure 8.3. Many diﬀerent mezzanine
tranches, created in the way indicated in Figure 8.1, are put in a portfolio and the risks
associated with the cash ﬂows from the portfolio are tranched out in the same way as the
risks associated with cash ﬂows from the assets are tranched out in Figure 8.1. The
resulting structure is known as an ABS CDO or Mezz ABS CDO. In the example in
Figure 8.3, the senior tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for 65% of the principal of the
ABS mezzanine tranches, the mezzanine tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for 25% of
the principal, and the equity tranche accounts for the remaining 10% of the principal.
The structure is designed so that the senior tranche of the ABS CDO is given the highest
credit rating of AAA. This means that the total of the AAA-rated instruments created in
the example that is considered here is about 90% (80% plus 65% of 15%) of the
principal of the underlying portfolios. This seems high but, if the securitization were
carried further with an ABS being created from tranches of ABS CDOs (and this did
happen), the percentage would be pushed even higher.
In the example in Figure 8.3, the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS can expect to receive
its promised return and get its principal back if losses on the underlying portfolio of

assets is less than 20% because all losses of principal would then be absorbed by the
more junior tranches. The AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO in Figure 8.3 is more
risky. It will receive the promised return and get its principal back if losses on the
underlying assets are 10.25% or less. This is because a loss of 10.25% means that
mezzanine tranches of ABSs have to absorb losses equal to 5.25% of the ABS principal.
As these tranches have a total principal equal to 15% of the ABS principal, they lose
5.25/15 or 35% of their principal. The equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO
are then wiped out, but the senior tranche just manages to survive intact.
The senior tranche of the ABS CDO suﬀers losses if losses on the underlying
portfolios are more than 10.25%. Consider, for example, the situation where losses
are 17% on the underlying portfolios. Of the 17%, 5% is borne by the equity tranche
of the ABS and 12% by the mezzanine tranche of the ABS. Losses on the mezzanine
tranches are therefore 12/15 or 80% of their principal. The ﬁrst 35% is absorbed by the
equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO. The senior tranche of the ABS CDO
therefore loses 45/65 or 69.2% of its value. These and other results are summarized in
Table 8.1. Our calculations assume that all ABS portfolios have the same default rate.
8.2
THE US HOUSING MARKET
Figure 8.4 gives the S&P/Case–Shiller composite-10 index for house prices in the US
between January 1987 and February 2013. This tracks house prices for ten metropolitan
areas of the US. It shows that, in about the year 2000, house prices started to rise much
faster than they had in the previous decade. The very low level of interest rates between
2002 and 2005 was an important contributory factor, but the bubble in house prices
was largely fueled by mortgage-lending practices.
The 2000 to 2006 period was characterized by a huge increase in what is termed
subprime mortgage lending. Subprime mortgages are mortgages that are considered to
be signiﬁcantly more risky than average. Before 2000, most mortgages classiﬁed as
subprime were second mortgages. After 2000, this changed as ﬁnancial institutions
became more comfortable with the notion of a subprime ﬁrst mortgage.
The Relaxation of Lending Standards
The relaxation of lending standards and the growth of subprime mortgages made house
purchase possible for many families that had previously been considered to be not
suﬃciently creditworthy to qualify for a mortgage. These families increased the demand

for real estate and prices rose. To mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders, it was
attractive to make more loans, particularly when higher house prices resulted. More
lending meant bigger proﬁts. Higher house prices meant that the lending was well
covered by the underlying collateral. If the borrower defaulted, it was less likely that the
resulting foreclosure would lead to a loss.
Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders naturally wanted to keep increasing their
proﬁts. Their problem was that, as house prices rose, it was more diﬃcult for ﬁrst-time
buyers to aﬀord a house. In order to continue to attract new entrants to the housing
market, they had to ﬁnd ways to relax their lending standards even more—and this is
exactly what they did. The amount lent as a percentage of the house price increased.
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMS) were developed where there was a low ‘‘teaser’’
rate of interest that would last for two or three years and be followed by a rate that
was much higher.3 A typical teaser rate was about 6% and the interest rate after the
end of the teaser rate period was typically six-month LIBOR plus 6%.4 However,
teaser rates as low as 1% or 2% have been reported. Lenders also became more
cavalier in the way they reviewed mortgage applications. Indeed, the applicant’s
income and other information reported on the application form were frequently not
checked.
Subprime Mortgage Securitization
Subprime mortgages were frequently securitized in the way indicated in Figures 8.1
to 8.3. The investors in tranches created from subprime mortgages usually had no
guarantees that interest and principal would be paid. Securitization played a part in the

3 If real estate prices increased, lenders expected the borrowers to prepay and take out a new mortgage at the
end of the teaser rate period. However, prepayment penalties, often zero on prime mortgages, were quite high
on subprime mortgages.

CHAPTER 8

crisis. The behavior of mortgage originators was inﬂuenced by their knowledge that
mortgages would be securitized.5 When considering new mortgage applications, the
question was not ‘‘Is this a credit risk we want to assume?’’ Instead it was ‘‘Is this a
mortgage we can make money on by selling it to someone else?’’
When a portfolio of mortgages was securitized, the buyers of the products that were
created felt they had enough information if they knew, for each mortgage in the
portfolio, the loan-to-value ratio (i.e., the ratio of the size of the loan to the assessed
value of the house) and the borrower’s FICO score.6 Other information on the
mortgage application forms was considered irrelevant and, as already mentioned, was
often not even checked by lenders. The most important thing for the lender was
whether the mortgage could be sold to others—and this depended largely on the
loan-to-value ratio and the applicant’s FICO score.
It is interesting to note in passing that both the loan-to-value ratio and the FICO
score were of doubtful quality. The property assessors who determined the value of a
house at the time of a mortgage application sometimes succumbed to pressure from the
lenders to come up with high values. Potential borrowers were sometimes counseled to
take certain actions that would improve their FICO scores.7
Why was the government not regulating the behavior of mortgage lenders? The
answer is that the US government had since the 1990s been trying to expand home
ownership and had been applying pressure to mortgage lenders to increase loans to low-
and moderate-income people. Some state legislators, such as those in Ohio and
Georgia, were concerned about what was going on and wanted to curtail predatory
lending.8 However, the courts decided that national standards should prevail.
A number of terms have been used to describe mortgage lending during the period
leading up to the credit crunch. One is ‘‘liar loans’’ because individuals applying for a
mortgage, knowing that no checks would be carried out, sometimes chose to lie on the
application form. Another term used to describe some borrowers is ‘‘NINJA’’ (no
income, no job, no assets).
The Bubble Bursts
All bubbles burst eventually and this one was no exception. In 2007, many mortgage
holders found that they could no longer aﬀord their mortgages when the teaser rates
ended. This led to foreclosures and large numbers of houses coming on the market,
which in turn led to a decline in house prices. Other mortgage holders, who had
borrowed 100%, or close to 100%, of the cost of a house found that they had negative
equity.
One of the features of the US housing market is that mortgages are nonrecourse in
many states. This means that, when there is a default, the lender is able to take
possession of the house, but other assets of the borrower are oﬀ-limits. Consequently,
the borrower has a free American-style put option. He or she can at any time sell the

300 to 850.

house to the lender for the principal outstanding on the mortgage. This feature
encouraged speculative activity and played a part in the cause of the bubble. Market
participants realized belatedly how costly and destabilizing the put option could be. If
the borrower had negative equity, the optimal decision was to exchange the house for
the outstanding principal on the mortgage. The house was then sold by the lender,
adding to the downward pressure on house prices.
It would be a mistake to assume that all mortgage defaulters were in the same
position. Some were unable to meet mortgage payments and suﬀered greatly when they
had to give up their homes. But many of the defaulters were speculators who bought
multiple homes as rental properties and chose to exercise their put options. It was their
tenants who suﬀered. There are also reports that some house owners (who were not
speculators) were quite creative in extracting value from their put options. After
handing the keys to their houses to the lender, they turned around and bought (some-
times at a bargain price) other houses that were in foreclosure. Imagine two people
owning identical houses next to each other. Both have mortgages of $250,000. Both
houses are worth $200,000 and in foreclosure can be expected to sell for $170,000. What
is the owners’ optimal strategy? The answer is that each person should exercise the put
option and buy the neighbor’s house.
The United States was not alone in having declining real estate prices. Prices declined
in many other countries as well. Real estate prices in the United Kingdom were
particularly badly aﬀected.
The Losses
As foreclosures increased, the losses on mortgages also increased. It might be thought
that a 35% reduction in house prices would lead to at most a 35% loss of principal on
defaulting mortgages. In fact, the losses were far greater than that. Houses in fore-
closure were often in poor condition and sold for a small fraction of what their value
was prior to the credit crisis. In 2008 and 2009, losses as high 75% of the mortgage
principal were reported for mortgages on houses in foreclosure in some cases.
Investors in tranches that were formed from the mortgages incurred big losses. The
value of the ABS tranches created from subprime mortgages was monitored by a series
of indices known as ABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated
BBB had lost about 80% of their value by the end of 2007 and about 97% of their
value by mid-2009. The value of the ABS CDO tranches created from BBB tranches
was monitored by a series of indices known as TABX. These indices indicated that the
tranches originally rated AAA lost about 80% of their value by the end of 2007 and
were essentially worthless by mid-2009.
Financial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup had big posi-
tions in some of the tranches and incurred huge losses, as did the insurance giant
AIG, which provided protection against losses on ABS CDO tranches that had
originally been rated AAA. Many ﬁnancial institutions had to be rescued with
government funds. There have been few worse years in ﬁnancial history than 2008.
Bear Stearns was taken over by JP Morgan Chase; Merrill Lynch was taken over by
Bank of America; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which had formerly been
investment banks, became bank holding companies with both commercial and
investment banking interests; and Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail (see Business
Snapshot 1.1).
214
CHAPTER 8

The Credit Crisis
The losses on securities backed by residential mortgages led to a severe credit crisis. In
2006, banks were reasonably well capitalized, loans were relatively easy to obtain, and
credit spreads were low. (The credit spread is the excess of the interest rate on a loan
over the risk-free interest rate.) By 2008, the situation was totally diﬀerent. The capital
of banks had been badly eroded by their losses. They had become much more risk-
averse and were reluctant to lend. Creditworthy individuals and corporations found
borrowing diﬃcult. Credit spreads had increased dramatically. The world experienced
its worst recession in several generations. One measure of the stress in ﬁnancial markets
is the TED spread. This is the excess of the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate over
the three-month Treasury interest. In normal market conditions, it is 30 to 50 basis
points. It reached over 450 basis points in October 2008.
8.3
WHAT WENT WRONG?
‘‘Irrational exuberance’’ is a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, to describe the behavior of investors during the bull market of the 1990s.
It can also be applied to the period leading up the the credit crisis. Mortgage lenders, the
investors in tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs that were created from residential
mortgages, and the companies that sold protection on the tranches assumed that the
good times would last for ever. They thought that US house prices would continue to
increase. There might be declines in one or two areas, but the possibility of the
widespread decline shown in Figure 8.4 was a scenario not considered by most people.
Many factors contributed to the crisis that started in 2007. Mortgage originators
used lax lending standards. Products were developed to enable mortgage originators to
proﬁtably transfer credit risk to investors. Rating agencies moved from their traditional
business of rating bonds, where they had a great deal of experience, to rating structured
products, which were relatively new and for which there were relatively little historical
data. The products bought by investors were complex and in many instances investors
and rating agencies had inaccurate or incomplete information about the quality of the
underlying assets. Investors in the structured products that were created thought they
had found a money machine and chose to rely on rating agencies rather than forming
their own opinions about the underlying risks. The return oﬀered by the products rated
AAA was high compared with the returns on bonds rated AAA.
Structured products such as those in Figures 8.1 and 8.3 are highly dependent on the
default correlation between the underlying assets. Default correlation measures the
tendency for diﬀerent borrowers to default at about the same time. If the default
correlation between the underlying assets in Figure 8.1 is low, the AAA-rated tranches
are very unlikely to experience losses. As this default correlation increases, they become
more vulnerable. The tranches of ABS CDOs in Figure 8.3 are even more heavily
dependent on default correlation.
If mortgages exhibit moderate default correlation (as they do in normal times), there
is very little chance of a high overall default rate and the AAA-rated tranches of both
ABSs and ABS CDOs that are created from mortgages are fairly safe. However, as
many investors found to their cost, default correlations tend to increase in stressed
market conditions. This makes very high default rates possible.
Securitization and the Credit Crisis of 2007
215

There was a tendency to assume that a tranche with a particular rating could be
equated to a bond with the that rating. The rating agencies published the criteria they
used for rating tranches. S&P and Fitch rated a tranche so as to ensure that the
probability of the tranche experiencing a loss was the same as the probability of a
similarly rated bond experiencing a loss. Moody’s rated a tranche so that the expected
loss from the tranche was the the same as the expected loss from a similarly rated bond.9
The procedures used by rating agencies were therefore designed to ensure that one
aspect of the loss distributions of tranches and bonds were matched. However, other
aspects of the distributions were liable to be quite diﬀerent.
The diﬀerences between tranches and bonds were accentuated by the fact tranches
were often quite thin. The AAA tranches often accounted for about 80% of the
principal as in Figure 8.1, but it was not unusual for there to be 15 to 20 other
tranches. Each of these tranches would be 1% or 2% wide. Such thin tranches are
likely to either incur no losses or be totally wiped out. The chance of investors
recovering part of their principal (as bondholders usually do) is small. Consider, for
example, a BBB tranche that is responsible for losses in the range 5% to 6%, If losses
on the underlying portfolio are less than 5%, the tranche is safe. If losses are greater
than 6%, the tranche is wiped out. Only in the case where losses are between 5% and
6% is a partial recovery made by investors.
The diﬀerence between a thin BBB-rated tranche and a BBB-rated bond was over-
looked by many investors. The diﬀerence makes the tranches of ABS CDOs created
from the BBB-rated tranches of ABSs much riskier than tranches created in a similar
way from BBB bonds. Losses on a portfolio of BBB bonds can reasonably be assumed
to be unlikely to exceed 25% in even the most severe market conditions. Table 8.1
shows that 100% losses on a portfolio of BBB tranches can occur relatively easily—and
this is even more true when the tranches are only 1% or 2% wide.
Regulatory Arbitrage
Many of the mortgages were originated by banks and it was banks that were the main
investors in the tranches that were created from the mortgages. Why would banks
choose to securitize mortgages and then buy the securitized products that were
created? The answer concerns what is termed regulatory arbitrage. The regulatory
capital banks were required to keep for the tranches created from a portfolio of
mortgages was much less than the regulatory capital that would be required for the
mortgages themselves.
Incentives
One of the lessons from the crisis is the importance of incentives. Economists use the
term ‘‘agency costs’’ to describe the situation where incentives are such that the interests
of two parties in a business relationship are not perfectly aligned. The process by which
mortgages were originated, securitized, and sold to investors was unfortunately riddled
with agency costs.

criteria used, see J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘Ratings Arbitrage and Structured Products,’’ Journal of Derivatives,

CHAPTER 8

The incentive of the originators of mortgages was to make loans that would be
acceptable to the creators of the ABS and ABS CDO tranches. The incentive of the
individuals who valued the houses on which the mortgages were written was to please
the lender by providing as high a valuation as possible so that the loan-to-value ratio
was as low as possible. (Pleasing the lender was likely to lead to more business from that
lender.) The main concern of the creators of tranches was how the tranches would be
rated. They wanted the volume of AAA-rated tranches that they created to be as high as
possible and found ways of using the published criteria of rating agencies to achieve
this. The rating agencies were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated and about
half their income came from structured products.
Another source of agency costs concerns the incentives of the employees of ﬁnancial
institutions. Employee compensation falls into three categories: regular salary, the end-
of-year bonus, and stock or stock options. Many employees at all levels of seniority in
ﬁnancial institutions, particularly traders, receive much of their compensation in the
form of end-of-year bonuses. This form of compensation is focused on short-term
performance. If an employee generates huge proﬁts one year and is responsible for
severe losses the next, the employee will often receive a big bonus the ﬁrst year and will
not have to return it the following year. (The employee might lose his or her job as a
result of the second year losses, but even that is not a disaster. Financial institutions
seem to be surprisingly willing to recruit individuals with losses on their re´ sume´ s.)
Imagine you are an employee of a ﬁnancial institution in 2006 responsible for
investing in ABS CDOs created from mortgages. Almost certainly you would have
recognized that there was a bubble in the US housing market and would expect that
bubble to burst sooner or later. However, it is possible that you would decide to
continue with your ABS CDO investments. If the bubble did not burst until after the
end of 2006, you would still get a nice bonus at the end of 2006.

THE AFTERMATH
Prior to the crisis, over-the-counter derivatives markets were largely unregulated. This
has changed. As mentioned in earlier chapters, there is now a requirement that most
standardized over-the-counter derivatives be cleared through central counterparties
(CCPs). This means that they are treated similarly to derivatives such as futures that
trade on exchanges. Banks will usually be members of one or more CCPs. When
trading standardized derivatives, they will be required to post initial margin and
variation margin with the CCP and will also be required to contribute to a default
fund. For transactions that continue to be cleared bilaterally, collateral arrangements
will be legislated rather than left to the judgement of the parties involved.
The bonuses paid by banks have come under more scrutiny and it is possible that in
some jurisdictions there will be limits on the sizes of the bonuses that can be paid. The
way bonuses are paid is changing. Before the crisis it was common for a trader’s bonus
for a year to be paid in full at the end of the year with no possibility of the bonus having
to be returned. It is now more common for this bonus to be spread over several years
and for it to be forfeited if subsequent results are poor.
The Dodd–Frank Act in the US and similar legislation in the UK and European
Union provide for more oversight of ﬁnancial institutions and include much new
legislation aﬀecting ﬁnancial institutions. For example, proprietary trading and other
Securitization and the Credit Crisis of 2007

similar activities of deposit-taking institutions are being made more diﬃcult. (This is
known as the ‘‘Volcker rule’’ in the US because it was proposed by former Federal
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker. An independent committee in the UK chaired by Sir
John Vickers has similarly proposed that the retail operations of banks be ring fenced.
The Likanen committee in the European Union wants trading and other high-risk
trading to be separated from other banking activities.) Another rule requires every
ﬁnancial institution that is designated as systemically important to prepare what is
known as a ‘‘living will’’ mapping out how it can be safely wound up in the event of
failure. A further rule requires issuers of securitized products (with some exceptions) to
keep 5% of each product created.
Banks throughout the world are regulated by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision.10 Prior to the crisis, the committee implemented regulations known as
Basel I and Basel II. These are summarized in Business Snapshot 8.1. Following the
crisis, it has implemented what is known as ‘‘Basel II.5.’’ This increases the capital
requirements for market risk. Basel III was published in 2010 and will be implemented
over a period lasting until 2019. It increases the amount of capital and quality of capital
that banks are required to keep. It also requires banks to satisfy certain liquidity
requirements. As discussed in Business Snapshot 4.2, one cause of problems during
the crisis was the tendency of banks to place too much reliance on the use of short-term
liabilities for long-term funding needs. The liquidity requirements are designed to make
it more diﬃcult for them to do this.
SUMMARY
Securitization is a process used by banks to create securities from loans and other
income-producing assets. The securities are sold to investors. This removes the loans
Business Snapshot 8.1
The Basel Committee
As the activities of banks became more global in the 1980s, it became necessary for
regulators in diﬀerent countries to work together to determine an international
regulatory framework. As a result the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
was formed. In 1988, it published a set of rules for the capital banks were required to
keep for credit risk. These capital requirements have become known as Basel I. They
were modiﬁed to accommodate the netting of transactions in 1995. In 1996 a new
capital requirement for market risk was published. This capital requirement was
implemented in 1998. In 1999 signiﬁcant changes were proposed for the calculation
of the capital requirements for credit risk and a capital requirement for operational
risk was introduced. These rules are referred to as Basel II. Basel II is considerably
more complicated than Basel I and its implementation was delayed until 2007 (later
in some countries). During the credit crisis and afterwards the Basel committee
introduced new regulatory requirements known as Basel II.5, which increased capital
for market risk. After that came Basel III, which tightened capital requirements and
introduced liquidity requirements.

from the banks’ balance sheets and enables the banks to expand their lending faster than
they would otherwise be able to. The ﬁrst loans to be securitized were mortgages in the
US in the 1960s and 1970s. Investors who bought the mortgage-backed securities were
not exposed to the risk of borrowers defaulting because the loans were backed by the
Government National Mortgage Association. Later automobile loans, corporate loans,
credit card receivables, and subprime mortgages were securitized. In many cases,
investors in the securities created from these instruments did not have a guarantee against
defaults.
Securitization played a part in the credit crisis that started in 2007. Tranches were
created from subprime mortgages and new tranches were then created from these
tranches. The origins of the crisis can be found in the US housing market. The US
government was keen to encourage home ownership. Interest rates were low. Mortgage
brokers and mortgage lenders found it attractive to do more business by relaxing their
lending standards. Securitization meant that the investors bearing the credit risk were
not usually the same as the original lenders. Rating agencies gave AAA ratings to the
senior tranches that were created. There was no shortage of buyers for these AAA-rated
tranches because their yields were higher than the yields on other AAA-rated securities.
Banks thought the ‘‘good times’’ would continue and, because compensation plans
focused their attention on short-term proﬁts, chose to ignore the housing bubble and its
potential impact on some very complicated products they were trading.
House prices rose as both ﬁrst-time buyers and speculators entered the market. Some
mortgages had included a low ‘‘teaser rate’’ for two or three years. After the teaser rate
ended, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the interest rate for some borrowers. Unable to
meet the higher interest rate they had no choice but to default. This led to foreclosures
and an increase in the supply of houses be sold. The price increases between 2000 and
2006 began to be reversed. Speculators and others who found that the amount owing
on their mortgages was greater than the value of their houses (i.e., they had negative
equity) defaulted. This accentuated the price decline.
Banks are paying a price for the crisis. New legislation and regulation will reduce their
proﬁtability. For example, capital requirements are being increased, liquidity regulations
are being introduced, and OTC derivatives are being much more tightly regulated.

OIS Discounting,
Credit Issues, and
Funding Costs
This chapter discusses a number of issues that have become important in derivatives
markets since the credit crisis of 2007. The ﬁrst of these concerns the choice of a risk-
free discount rate. This is important because, as we will see in later chapters, the
valuation of almost any derivative involves discounting expected cash ﬂows at a risk-
free rate. Prior to the credit crisis, market participants usually used LIBOR/swap rates
as proxies for risk-free rates. They constructed a zero curve from LIBOR rates and
LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap rates as described in Section 7.6 and used this to provide risk-
free zero rates. Since the crisis, they have started to use other proxies in some
circumstances.
The second part of the chapter discusses credit risk. This has become a progressively
more important issue for derivatives markets. Exchanges have traditionally handled the
credit risk in derivatives very well. (Chapter 2, for example, explains the way in which
the trading of futures is designed to minimize credit risk.) Over-the-counter derivatives,
as explained in Section 2.5, are either cleared bilaterally or centrally. Central clearing
operates similarly to exchange clearing and, if managed prudently, should be equally
eﬀective in reducing credit risk. Bilateral clearing tends to involve more credit risk than
central clearing and a key issue for derivatives market participants is how credit risk
should be taken into account when bilaterally cleared derivatives are valued. This
chapter takes a ﬁrst look at this issue. More details are in Chapter 24.
The ﬁnal topic considered in this chapter is funding costs. Should funding costs
inﬂuence how derivatives are valued? This has become a controversial issue. Some
analysts support making what is termed a ‘‘funding value adjustment’’ (FVA) when
they price derivatives. Others argue that an FVA cannot be justiﬁed and leads to
arbitrage opportunities.
9.1
THE RISK-FREE RATE
The standard procedure for valuing a derivative involves setting up a risk-free portfolio
and arguing that in a no-arbitrage world it should earn the risk-free rate. Our valuation
of FRAs in Section 4.7 and forward contracts in Section 5.7 provide a simple
222
9
C H A P T E R

application of this idea. Swaps are portfolios of FRAs or forward contracts and so their
valuations also rely on risk-free discounting. Indeed, as our understanding of deriva-
tives develops, we will see that the valuation of almost any derivative requires risk-free
discounting. This makes the choice of the risk-free rate important.
In the United States, the rates on Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds
might be thought to be natural candidates for risk-free rates. These instruments are
issued by the US government and denominated in US dollars. Most analysts consider it
extremely unlikely that the US government will ever default on the instruments as it
always has the opportunity of increasing the money supply (which can be thought of as
‘‘printing more money’’) in order to repay lenders. Similar arguments can be made for
instruments issued by other governments in their own currencies.1
In fact, derivatives market participants do not use treasury rates as risk-free rates.
This is because treasury rates are generally considered to be artiﬁcially low. Some of the
reasons for this are listed in Business Snapshot 9.1. Pre-2008, market participants used
LIBOR rates and LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap rates as risk-free rates. LIBOR is, as described
in Section 4.1, the short-term (1 year or less) rate of interest at which creditworthy
banks (typically those rated AA or better) can borrow from other banks. Prior to the
credit crisis that started in 2007, LIBOR was thought to be close to risk-free. The
chance of a bank defaulting on a loan lasting 1 year or less, when the bank is rated AA
at the time the loan is granted, was thought to very small.
During the credit crisis, LIBOR rates soared because banks were reluctant to lend to
each other. As mentioned in Chapter 8, the TED spread, which is the excess of 3-month
Eurodollar deposit rate (which like 3-month LIBOR is an interbank borrowing rate)
Business Snapshot 9.1
What Is the Risk-Free Rate?
Derivatives dealers argue that the interest rates implied by Treasury bills and
Treasury bonds are artiﬁcially low because:
1. Treasury bills and Treasury bonds must be purchased by ﬁnancial institutions
to fulﬁll a variety of regulatory requirements. This increases demand for these
Treasury instruments driving the price up and the yield down.
2. The amount of capital a bank is required to hold to support an investment in
Treasury bills and bonds is substantially smaller than the capital required to
support a similar investment in other instruments with very low risk.
3. In the United States, Treasury instruments are given a favorable tax treatment
compared with most other ﬁxed-income investments because they are not taxed
at the state level.
Traditionally derivatives dealers have assumed that LIBOR rates are risk-free and
this is what we did when valuing swaps in Chapter 7. But LIBOR rates are not totally
risk-free. Following the credit crisis that started in 2007, many dealers switched to
using overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates as risk-free rates, at least for collateralized
transactions. These rates and the ways they are used are explained in this chapter.
1 Note that the argument does not apply to eurozone countries, that is, countries which use the euro as their
currency. This is because any one eurozone country, such as Italy or Spain, does not have control over the
European Central Bank.
OIS Discounting, Credit Issues, and Funding Costs
223

over the 3-month US Treasury bill rate, is less than 50 basis points in normal market
conditions. Between October 2007 and May 2009, it was rarely lower than 100 basis
points and peaked at over 450 basis points in October 2008. Clearly banks did not
regard loans to other banks as close to risk-free during this period!
It might be thought that their experience during the credit crisis would lead to
practitioners looking for a better proxy for the risk-free rate when valuing derivatives.
However, this is not exactly what has happened. Following the credit crisis, most banks
have changed their risk-free discount rates for collateralized transactions from LIBOR
to what are known as overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates (see next section). But for
non-collateralized transactions they continue to use LIBOR, or an even higher discount
rate. (See Section 2.5 for a discussion of collateralization.) This reﬂects a belief that the
discount rate used by a bank for a derivative should represent its average funding costs,
not a true risk-free rate. The average funding costs for a non-collateralized derivative is
considered to be at least as high as LIBOR. Collateralized derivatives are funded by the
collateral, and OIS rates, as we shall see, provide an estimate of the funding cost for
these transactions.
9.2
THE OIS RATE
As explained in Section 4.1, the fed funds rate is an overnight unsecured borrowing rate
of interest between ﬁnancial institutions in the US. A broker usually matches borrowers
and lenders. The weighted average of the rates in brokered transactions (with weights
proportional to transaction size) is termed the eﬀective federal funds rate. Other
countries have similar systems to the US. For example, in the UK the average of
brokered overnight rates is termed the sterling overnight index average (SONIA) and, in
the eurozone, it is termed the euro overnight index average (EONIA). The overnight
rate in a country is monitored by the central bank, which may intervene with its own
transactions in an attempt to raise or lower it.
An overnight indexed swap (OIS) is a swap where a ﬁxed rate for a period (e.g.,
1 month or 3 months) is exchanged for the geometric average of the overnight rates
during the period. (The overnight rates are the average of the rates in brokered
transactions as just described.) If, during a certain period, a bank borrows funds at
the overnight rate (rolling the interest and principal forward each day), the interest rate
it pays for the period is the geometric average of the overnight interest rates. Similarly,
if it lends money at the overnight interest rate every day (rolling the interest and
principal forward each day), the interest it earns for the period is also the geometric
average of the overnight interest rates. An OIS therefore allows overnight borrowing
or lending for a period to be swapped for borrowing or lending at a ﬁxed rate for the
period. The ﬁxed rate in an OIS is referred to as the OIS rate. If the geometric average
of daily rates for the period proves to be less than the ﬁxed rate, there is a payment
from the ﬁxed-rate payer to the ﬂoating-rate payer at the end of the period; otherwise,
there is a payment from the ﬂoating-rate payer to the ﬁxed-rate payer at the end of the
period.
Example 9.1
Suppose that in a US 3-month OIS the notional principal is $100 million and the
ﬁxed rate (i.e., the OIS rate) is 3% per annum. If the geometric average of overnight
224
CHAPTER 9

eﬀective federal funds rates during the 3 months proves to be 2.8% per annum, the
ﬁxed-rate payer has to pay 0:25  ð0:030  0:028Þ  $100,000,000 or $50,000 to the
ﬂoating-rate payer. (This calculation does not take account of the impact of day
count conventions.)
Overnight indexed swaps tend to have relatively short lives (often 3 months or less).
However, transactions that last as long as 5 to 10 years are becoming more common. An
OIS lasting longer than 1 year is typically divided into 3-month subperiods. At the end
of each subperiod the geometric average of the overnight rates during the subperiod is
exchanged for the OIS rate. In Section 7.5, we explained that the swap rate in a plain
vanilla LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap is a continually refreshed LIBOR rate (i.e., the rate that
can be earned on a series of short-term loans to AA-rated ﬁnancial institutions).
Similarly, the OIS rate is a continually refreshed overnight rate (i.e., it is the rate that
can be earned by a ﬁnancial institution from a series of overnight loans to other
ﬁnancial institutions).
Suppose that Bank A engages in the following transactions:
1. Borrow $100 million in the overnight market for 3 months, rolling the interest and
principal on the loan forward each night.
2. Lend the $100 million for 3 months at LIBOR to another bank, Bank B.
3. Use an OIS to exchange the overnight borrowings for borrowings at the 3-month
OIS rate.
This will lead to Bank A receiving the 3-month LIBOR rate and (assuming its
creditworthiness remains acceptable to the overnight market) paying the 3-month
overnight indexed swap rate. We might therefore expect the 3-month overnight
indexed swap rate to equal the 3-month LIBOR rate. However, it is generally lower.
This is because Bank A requires some compensation for the risk it is taking that Bank
B will default on the 3-month LIBOR loan. The overnight lenders to Bank A bear
much less risk than Bank A does when it lends to Bank B for 3 months. This is
because they have the option of ceasing to lend to Bank A if Bank A’s credit quality
declines.
The excess of the 3-month LIBOR rate over the 3-month overnight indexed swap rate
is known as the 3-month LIBOR-OIS spread. It is often used as a measure of stress in
ﬁnancial markets. Its values between 2002 and 2013 are shown in Figure 9.1. In normal
market conditions, it is about 10 basis points. However, it rose sharply during the 2007–
2009 credit crisis because banks became less willing to lend to each other for 3-month
periods. In October 2008, the spread spiked to an all time high of 364 basis points. By a
year later it had returned to more normal levels. But it has since increased in response to
stresses and uncertainties in ﬁnancial markets. For example, it rose to about 50 basis
points at the end of December 2011 as a result of concerns about the economies of
European countries such as Greece.
The OIS rate is a good proxy for the risk-free rate. The OIS rate is not totally risk-
free, but it is very close to risk-free. Two sources of risk can be identiﬁed, both very
small. The ﬁrst is that there might be a default on an overnight loan between two
ﬁnancial institutions. The chance of this is very small because any hint of an imminent
credit problem is likely to lead to a ﬁnancial institution being excluded from the
overnight market. The second is that there might be a default on the OIS swap itself.
OIS Discounting, Credit Issues, and Funding Costs
225

However, the adjustment to an OIS swap rate to reﬂect default possibilities is generally
very small (particularly if the OIS is collateralized).
Determining the OIS Zero Curve
In Section 7.6, we described how the bootstrap method can be used to calculate the
LIBOR/swap zero curve. We saw that LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap rates deﬁne a series of par
yield bonds. A key point here is that, for the swap rates to deﬁne a series of par yield
bonds, it is necessary for the rates being bootstrapped to be the same as the rates being
used for discounting.
The procedure for constructing the OIS zero curve when OIS rates are used for
discounting is similar to that used to construct the LIBOR zero curve when LIBOR
rates are used for discounting. The 1-month OIS rate deﬁnes the 1-month zero rate, the
3-month OIS rate deﬁnes the 3-month zero rate, and so on. When there are periodic
settlements in the OIS contract, the OIS rate deﬁnes a par yield bond. Suppose, for
example, that the 5-year OIS rate is 3.5% with quarterly settlements. (This means that
at the end of each quarter 0:25  3:5% ¼ 0:875% is exchanged for the geometric
average of the overnight rates during the quarter.) A 5-year bond paying a quarterly
coupon at a rate of 3.5% per annum would be assumed to sell for par.
Although OIS swaps are becoming more liquid, they do not trade for maturities that
are as long as the more common LIBOR-for-ﬁxed interest rate swaps. If the OIS zero
curve is required for long maturities, a natural approach is to assume that the spread
between an OIS rate and the corresponding LIBOR/swap rates is the same at the long
end as it is for the longest OIS maturity for which there is reliable data. Suppose, for
example, that there are no reliable data on OIS swaps for maturities longer than
5 years. If the 5-year OIS rate is 4.7% and the 5-year LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap rate is
4.9%, OIS rates could be assumed to be 20 basis points less than the corresponding
LIBOR/swap rates for all maturities beyond 5 years. An alternative approach for
extending the OIS zero curve is to use basis swaps where 3-month LIBOR is exchanged

the US.2
9.3
VALUING SWAPS AND FRAS WITH OIS DISCOUNTING
Once the OIS zero curve has been determined, many types of derivatives can be valued
using OIS rates as the risk-free discount rates. For example, the value of a forward
contract on an asset can be calculated using equation (5.4) with r equal to the OIS zero
rate for a maturity of T years.3 To value swaps and FRAs we have a little more work to
do. It is ﬁrst necessary to calculate forward LIBOR in a way that is consistent with OIS
discounting.
Determining Forward LIBOR Rates with OIS Discounting
LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swaps can be valued assuming that forward LIBOR rates are realized.
LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swaps, if transacted at today’s mid-market swap rates, are worth zero.
This provides a way of determining LIBOR forward rates. The LIBOR forward rates
given by OIS discounting are diﬀerent from those given by LIBOR discounting. We will
illustrate this for a simple situation. Example 9.2 calculates a forward LIBOR rate
assuming that LIBOR rates are used for discounting. Example 9.3 calculates the same
forward LIBOR rate assuming that OIS rates are used for discounting.
Example 9.2
Suppose that the 1-year LIBOR rate is 5% and the 2-year LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap
rate with annual payments is 6%. Both rates are annually compounded. A bank
uses LIBOR rates for discounting. Suppose that R is the 2-year LIBOR/swap zero
rate. Because a bond providing a coupon of 6% is a par yield bond (see Section 7.6)
we must have
6
1:05 þ
106
ð1 þ RÞ2 ¼ 100
Solving this gives R ¼ 6:030%. Suppose that F is the forward LIBOR rate for the
1-year period beginning in 1 year. We can calculate it from the zero rates:
F ¼ 1:060302
1:05
 1 ¼ 7:0707%
As a check of this result, we can calculate F so that it makes the value of the swap
zero. The exchange in 1 year to the party receiving ﬁxed is worth þ1 per 100 of
2 If the swap rate for a 30-year LIBOR interest rate swap is 5% and LIBOR is swapped for the average
federal funds rate plus 20 basis points, it might be assumed that the 30-year OIS rate is 4.8% (assuming
appropriate adjustments have been made for day counts). Unfortunately, this would involve an
approximation as a swap of fed funds for LIBOR involves the arithmetic average (not geometric average)
of overnight rates during a period being swapped for the LIBOR rate applicable to the period. A ‘‘convexity
adjustment’’ is in theory necessary. See, for example, K. Takada, ‘‘Valuation of Arithmetic Average of Fed
Funds Rates and Construction of the US Dollar Swap Yield Curve,’’ 2011, SSRN-id981668.

interpolating between forward prices observed in the market.

principal. (This is because the party receives 6 and pays 5.) Assuming forward
rates are realized, the exchange in 2 years is 6  100F per 100 of principal. The
value of the swap is
1
1:05 þ 6  100F
1:060302
per 100 of principal. Setting this equal to zero and solving for F, we see that
F ¼ 7:0707% as before.
Example 9.3
As in Example 9.2, suppose that the 1-year LIBOR rate is 5% and the 2-year
swap rate with annual payments is 6%. (Both rates are annually compounded.)
A bank uses OIS rates for discounting. Assume that the OIS zero curve has been
calculated as described in Section 9.2 and the 1- and 2-year OIS zero rates are
4.5% and 5.5% with annual compounding. (In this situation, OIS zero rates are
therefore about 50 basis points lower than LIBOR zero rates.) Suppose that F is
the forward LIBOR rate for the 1-year period beginning in 1 year. Swaps can be
valued assuming that forward LIBOR rates are realized. Because a swap where
6% is received and LIBOR is paid is worth zero, we must have
1
1:045 þ 6  100F
1:0552
¼ 0
Solving this gives F ¼ 7:0651%.
In Examples 9.2 and 9.3, when we switch from LIBOR discounting to OIS discounting,
the forward LIBOR changes from 7.0707% to 7.0651%. The change is a little more
than half a basis point. It is small, but is something that traders would not want to
ignore. In practice, the impact of the switch depends on the steepness of the zero curve
and the maturity of the forward rate (see DerivaGem 3.00).
Calculations of the sort we have given in Example 9.3 enable a forward LIBOR curve
to be constructed when OIS rates are used as risk-free discount rates. Using a series of
swaps where exchanges are made every 3 months enables the 3-month forward rates as a
function of maturity (i.e., as a function of the start of the 3-month period) to be
constructed; using swaps where exchanges are made every 6 months enables the 6-month
forward rate as a function of maturity to be constructed; and so on.4 (Interpolation
between calculated forward rates is used to determine complete forward LIBOR curves.)
When a swap is valued using OIS discounting, the forward rates corresponding to the
swap’s cash ﬂows are obtained from the appropriate forward LIBOR curves. Cash ﬂows
on the swap are then calculated assuming these forward rates will occur and the cash
ﬂows are discounted at the appropriate OIS zero rates.
9.4
OIS vs. LIBOR: WHICH IS CORRECT?
As already mentioned, most derivatives dealers now use discount rates based on OIS
rates when valuing collateralized derivatives (i.e., derivatives where there is a collateral

information to assist in the compilation of a complete set of LIBOR forward curves corresponding to
diﬀerent accrual periods.

CHAPTER 9

agreement similar to that outlined in Section 2.5) and discount rates based on LIBOR
when valuing non-collateralized derivatives.5 The reason most commonly given for this
concerns funding costs. Collateralized derivatives are funded by the collateral and the
federal funds rate (which, as we have explained, is linked to the OIS rate) is the overnight
interest rate most commonly paid on collateral. In the case of non-collateralized
transactions, it is argued that funding costs are higher and the discount rate should
reﬂect this.
As explained later, arguments based on funding costs are questionable because it is a
long-established principle in ﬁnance that the evaluation of an investment should not
depend on the way it is funded. It is the risk of the investment and its expected cash
ﬂows that are important. Finance theory leads to the conclusion that we should always
use the best proxy available for the risk-free rate when discounting in situations where
riskless portfolios have been set up. Arguably the OIS zero curve is as close to risk-free
as we can get. It should therefore be used for discounting regardless of whether the
transaction is collateralized.6
9.5
CREDIT RISK: CVA AND DVA
It should be emphasized that the discount rate is not used as a way of allowing for credit
risk when a derivative is valued. The purpose of the valuations we have described so far
(whether OIS or LIBOR is used for discounting) is to calculate the value of the
derivative assuming that neither side will default. (We refer to this as the ‘‘no-default
value’’ of the derivative.) Credit risk is generally taken into account by a separate
calculation. We now describe the nature of that calculation. More details are in
Chapter 24.
Suppose that a bank and a counterparty have entered into a portfolio of derivatives
transactions which are cleared bilaterally. The ﬁrst point to note is that the agreement
between the bank and the counterparty will almost certainly state that netting applies.
This means that all outstanding derivatives are considered as a single derivative in the
event of a default. When one party declares bankruptcy, fails to post collateral as
required, or fails to perform as promised in some other way, the other party will declare
an event of default. This will lead to an early termination of the portfolio of out-
standing derivatives transactions.
Suppose ﬁrst that no collateral posted. If the early termination happens when the
derivatives portfolio has a positive value to the bank and a negative value to the
counterparty, the bank will be an unsecured creditor for an amount equal to the value
of the portfolio and is likely to incur a loss because it will fail to recover the full value of
the derivatives portfolio. In the opposite situation, where the portfolio has a negative
value to the bank and a positive value to the counterparty, the bank makes a settlement
payment to the counterparty (or to the counterparty’s liquidators) and there is no loss.
The credit value adjustment (CVA) is the bank’s estimate of the present value of the
5 LCH.Clearnet is a large CCP that was clearing interest rate swap transactions with a total notional
principal of over $350 trillion in 2013. Its transactions are collateralized with initial margin and variation
margin. Following the practice of dealers, it now uses OIS discounting rather than LIBOR discounting.
6 For further discussion of this, see J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting
Dilemma,’’ Journal of Investment Management, 11, 3 (2013), 14–27.
OIS Discounting, Credit Issues, and Funding Costs

expected cost to the bank of a counterparty default. Suppose that the life of the longest
outstanding derivatives transaction between the bank and the counterparty is T years.
To calculate CVA, the bank divides the next T years into a number of intervals. For
each interval, it calculates
1. The probability of an early termination during the interval arising from a
counterparty default, qi
2. The present value of the expected loss of the derivatives portfolio if there is an
early termination at the midpoint of the interval, vi.
CVA is calculated as
CVA ¼
X
N
i¼1
qivi
when N is the number of intervals. This formula is deceptively simple but the
calculation procedures, particularly those for determining the vi, are actually quite
complicated. They will be explained in Chapter 24.
Deﬁne fnd as the no-default value of the derivatives portfolio to the bank. This is the
value of the portfolio assuming that neither side will default. (Most of the formulas that
have been developed for valuing derivatives, including those in this book, are concerned
with calculating no-default values.) When the possibility of a counterparty default is
taken into account, the value of the portfolio becomes
fnd  CVA
But this is not the end of the story. The bank itself might default. This is liable to lead
to a loss to the counterparty together with an equal and opposite gain to the bank. The
debit (or debt) value adjustment (DVA) is the present value of the expected gain to the
bank from its own default. It is calculated similarly to CVA:
DVA ¼
X
N
i¼1
q
i v
i
where q
i is the probability of a default by the bank during the ith interval and v
i is the
present value of the bank’s gain (and the counterparty’s loss) if the bank defaults at the
midpoint of the interval. Taking both CVA and DVA into account, the value of the
portfolio to the bank is
fnd  CVA þ DVA
Collateral
When the agreement between the two parties requires collateral to be posted, calcula-
tions are more complicated for two reasons. First, the collateral aﬀects the calculation
of CVA and DVA. Second, the interest rate paid on cash collateral may inﬂuence
valuations.
To calculate vi and v
i it is necessary for the bank to calculate the collateral that
would be provided by the bank or by the counterparty at the time of an early
termination. This calculation is usually quite complicated because it is typically
assumed that the defaulting party will stop posting collateral, and will stop returning
excess collateral, several days before an early termination.
230
CHAPTER 9

Collateral can usually consist of cash or marketable securities. (The type of market-
able securities that are acceptable and the applicable haircuts are speciﬁed in the
collateral agreement.) Interest is normally paid on cash collateral. If this interest is
the risk-free rate, no adjustment to the valuation needs to be made. If the interest is
diﬀerent from the risk-free rate, the present value of the expected excess of actual net
interest paid on cash collateral over the net interest that would be paid if the interest rate
equaled the risk-free rate must be estimated. This can be positive or negative and
constitutes an adjustment which we will refer to as the collateral rate adjustment (CRA).
Taking it into account, the value of the portfolio becomes
fnd  CVA þ DVA  CRA
As already mentioned, banks tend to assume that the OIS rate is the risk-free rate for
collateralized transactions. If the eﬀective federal funds rate (which as explained earlier
underlies the OIS rate) is paid on overnight cash collateral balances (and this is often
the case), no CRA adjustment is necessary.
9.6
FUNDING COSTS
Suppose the risk-free rate is 5% and a bank’s average funding cost is 7%. If a project
comes along that is risk-free and provides a return of 6%, should the bank undertake it?
The answer is that the project should be undertaken. The appropriate discount rate for
the project’s cash ﬂows is 5% and the project has a positive present value when this
discount rate is used. It is not correct to argue that the bank is funding itself at 7% and
should therefore only undertake projects earning more than 7%. On average, the
projects undertaken by a bank should earn more than 7%; otherwise the bank would
be operating at a loss. But this does not mean that each individual project undertaken
by the bank should do so.
To understand why the 7% funding cost is not relevant to the valuation of a project,
consider what happens as the bank enters into projects that are risk-free. Its funding
costs will come down in such a way that the incremental costs of funding a risk-free
project is 5%, not 7%. We can illustrate how this happens by taking an extreme
example. Suppose that the bank we are considering were to double in size by under-
taking entirely risk-free projects. The bank’s funding cost will change to 6% (an average
of 7% for the old projects and 5% for the new projects). The incremental funding cost
for the new projects is then 5%.
In general, if a company uses its average funding cost as a hurdle rate for all projects,
low-risk project will tend to seem unattractive and high-risk projects will tend to seem
attractive. There will therefore be a tendency for the company to gravitate to higher-risk
projects.
Not all derivatives practitioners would agree with these arguments. Indeed, as
indicated earlier, current practice in many banks is to use OIS discounting for
collateralized derivatives, while a higher discount rate is used for non-collateralized
derivatives. The rationale usually given for this concerns funding costs (which we have
argued should not be relevant). Collateralized derivatives are funded at the rate of
interest paid on the collateral (often the federal funds rate). Non-collateralized deriva-
tives are assumed to be funded at the bank’s overall average funding cost.
OIS Discounting, Credit Issues, and Funding Costs
231

Those banks that consider funding costs to be relevant in derivatives valuation some-
times make what is termed a funding value adjustment (FVA) for non-collateralized
derivatives. The purpose of an FVA is to change the value of a derivative to what it would
be if the bank’s average funding cost were used as the ‘‘risk-free’’ discount rate. If the
bank’s average funding cost is, say, 3.8% and the risk-free discount rate used by the bank
is 3%, FVA captures the impact of increasing the discount rate by 80 basis points.7
FVA adjustments are controversial. Whether they withstand the test of time remains
to be seen. We have already made the point that funding costs should not inﬂuence how
an investment is valued. It is the riskiness of the investment that is important. CVA and
DVA adjustments should be made, but much of the debate surrounding FVA seems to
arise from a confusion between FVA and DVA. High-funding-cost banks that make
FVA adjustments will tend to provide competitive pricing for derivatives that generate
funding (e.g., the sale of options); low-funding-cost banks that make FVA adjustments
will tend to provide competitive pricing for derivatives that require funding. FVA can
create arbitrage opportunities for end-users. They can buy options from high-funding-
cost dealers and sell the same options to low-funding-cost dealers.8
The traders working for banks should of course be free to use any procedures they
like for determining the prices at which they are prepared to trade. However, transac-
tions have to be valued daily for accounting and other purposes. (This is referred to as
marking-to-market the transactions.) Accountants working for a bank aim to value a
transaction at the ‘‘exit price.’’ This is the current market price at which the bank could
enter into an oﬀsetting transaction. At any given time the exit price should be a price
that clears the market (i.e., balances supply and demand). It should not depend on the
funding cost of the bank holding the derivative.
SUMMARY
We saw in earlier chapters that the credit crisis that started in 2007 has led to the over-
the-counter derivatives markets being regulated much more heavily than before. In this
chapter, we have seen that it has also caused derivatives market participants to carefully
review their practices. Prior to the credit crisis, LIBOR was assumed to be a reasonable
proxy for the risk-free rate. (This was convenient. As indicated in Chapter 7, it made the
valuation of an interest rate swap where LIBOR is exchanged for a ﬁxed rate of interest
relatively easy.) Since the credit crisis, practitioners have switched their risk-free proxy
from the LIBOR rate to the OIS rate—at least for collateralized derivatives transactions.
The OIS rate is a rate swapped for the geometric average of the overnight federal
funds rate. It is not perfectly risk-free because a default on an overnight loan or the
swap is always possible. However, it is much closer to risk-free than LIBOR.
Using OIS rates rather than LIBOR rates for discounting changes estimates of
forward LIBOR rates. When OIS discounting is used, forward LIBOR rates must be
7 As we shall see in later chapters, interest rates play two roles in the valuation of derivatives. They deﬁne the
discount rate and they deﬁne the growth rate of the underlying asset in a risk-neutral world. We increase the
interest rate when it is used for the ﬁrst purpose but not the second. This is because the positions in the
underlying asset that are used to hedge the derivative can be repoed and therefore funded at very close to the
risk-free rate. Positions in derivatives cannot be repoed.

Adjustments and Fair Value,’’ Financial Analysts Journal, forthcoming.

estimated so that all LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swaps if entered into today at the mid-market
swap rate have zero value.
Banks and other derivatives dealers have for many years been concerned about
counterparty credit risk. Two adjustments are currently made for bilaterally cleared
transactions. The credit value adjustment (CVA) is an adjustment for the possibility
that the counterparty will default and reduces the value of a derivatives portfolio. The
debit (or debt) value adjustment (DVA) is an adjustment for the possibility that the
bank will default and increases the value of a derivatives portfolio. In addition, for
collateralized portfolios, a further adjustment can be necessary if the interest paid on
cash collateral is diﬀerent from the risk-free rate.
Finance theory shows that the way a project is funded should not inﬂuence its
valuation. In spite of this, some banks do make what is termed a funding value
adjustment (FVA) so that a derivatives portfolio which requires (generates) funding is
charged with (given credit for) an amount reﬂecting the bank’s average funding cost.
FVAs are controversial and have the potential to lead to disagreements between
accountants, analysts, and traders.

CHAPTER 9

Mechanics of
Options Markets
We introduced options in Chapter 1. This chapter explains how options markets are
organized, what terminology is used, how the contracts are traded, how margin
requirements are set, and so on. Later chapters will examine such topics as trading
strategies involving options, the determination of option prices, and the ways in which
portfolios of options can be hedged. This chapter is concerned primarily with stock
options. It also presents some introductory material on currency options, index options,
and futures options. More details concerning these instruments can be found in
Chapters 17 and 18.
Options are fundamentally diﬀerent from forward and futures contracts. An option
gives the holder of the option the right to do something, but the holder does not have to
exercise this right. By contrast, in a forward or futures contract, the two parties have
committed themselves to some action. It costs a trader nothing (except for the margin/
collateral requirements) to enter into a forward or futures contract, whereas the
purchase of an option requires an up-front payment.
When charts showing the gain or loss from options trading are produced, the usual
practice is to ignore the time value of money, so that the proﬁt is the ﬁnal payoﬀminus
the initial cost. This chapter follows this practice.
10.1
TYPES OF OPTIONS
As mentioned in Chapter 1, there are two types of options. A call option gives the
holder of the option the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put
option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price. The
date speciﬁed in the contract is known as the expiration date or the maturity date.
The price speciﬁed in the contract is known as the exercise price or the strike price.
Options can be either American or European, a distinction that has nothing to do
with geographical location. American options can be exercised at any time up to the
expiration date, whereas European options can be exercised only on the expiration date
itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. However,
European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some
of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its
European counterpart.
235

C H A P T E R

Call Options
Consider the situation of an investor who buys a European call option with a strike
price of $100 to purchase 100 shares of a certain stock. Suppose that the current stock
price is $98, the expiration date of the option is in 4 months, and the price of an option
to purchase one share is $5. The initial investment is $500. Because the option is
European, the investor can exercise only on the expiration date. If the stock price on this
date is less than $100, the investor will clearly choose not to exercise. (There is no point
in buying for $100 a share that has a market value of less than $100.) In these
circumstances, the investor loses the whole of the initial investment of $500. If the
stock price is above $100 on the expiration date, the option will be exercised. Suppose,
for example, that the stock price is $115. By exercising the option, the investor is able to
buy 100 shares for $100 per share. If the shares are sold immediately, the investor makes
a gain of $15 per share, or $1,500, ignoring transaction costs. When the initial cost of
the option is taken into account, the net proﬁt to the investor is $1,000.
Figure 10.1 shows how the investor’s net proﬁt or loss on an option to purchase one
share varies with the ﬁnal stock price in the example. For example, when the ﬁnal stock
price is $120, the proﬁt from an option to purchase one share is $15. It is important to
realize that an investor sometimes exercises an option and makes a loss overall. Suppose
that, in the example, the stock price is $102 at the expiration of the option. The investor
would exercise for a gain of $102  $100 ¼ $2 and realize a loss overall of $3 when the
initial cost of the option is taken into account. It is tempting to argue that the investor
should not exercise the option in these circumstances. However, not exercising would
lead to a loss of $5, which is worse than the $3 loss when the investor exercises. In
general, call options should always be exercised at the expiration date if the stock price
is above the strike price.
Put Options
Whereas the purchaser of a call option is hoping that the stock price will increase, the
purchaser of a put option is hoping that it will decrease. Consider an investor who

buys a European put option with a strike price of $70 to sell 100 shares of a certain
stock. Suppose that the current stock price is $65, the expiration date of the option is
in 3 months, and the price of an option to sell one share is $7. The initial investment is
$700. Because the option is European, it will be exercised only if the stock price is
below $70 on the expiration date. Suppose that the stock price is $55 on this date. The
investor can buy 100 shares for $55 per share and, under the terms of the put option,
sell the same shares for $70 to realize a gain of $15 per share, or $1,500. (Again,
transaction costs are ignored.) When the $700 initial cost of the option is taken into
account, the investor’s net proﬁt is $800. There is no guarantee that the investor will
make a gain. If the ﬁnal stock price is above $70, the put option expires worthless, and
the investor loses $700. Figure 10.2 shows the way in which the investor’s proﬁt or loss
on an option to sell one share varies with the terminal stock price in this example.
Early Exercise
As mentioned earlier, exchange-traded stock options are usually American rather than
European. This means that the investor in the foregoing examples would not have to wait
until the expiration date before exercising the option. We will see later that there are some
circumstances when it is optimal to exercise American options before the expiration date.
10.2
OPTION POSITIONS
There are two sides to every option contract. On one side is the investor who has taken
the long position (i.e., has bought the option). On the other side is the investor who has
taken a short position (i.e., has sold or written the option). The writer of an option
receives cash up front, but has potential liabilities later. The writer’s proﬁt or loss is the
reverse of that for the purchaser of the option. Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the variation
of the proﬁt or loss with the ﬁnal stock price for writers of the options considered in
Figures 10.1 and 10.2.

There are four types of option positions:

2. A long position in a put option

4. A short position in a put option.
It is often useful to characterize a European option in terms of its payoﬀto the
purchaser of the option. The initial cost of the option is then not included in the
calculation. If K is the strike price and ST is the ﬁnal price of the underlying asset, the

Stock Options
Most trading in stock options is on exchanges. In the United States, the exchanges
include the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com), NYSE Euronext
(www.euronext.com), which acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, the
International Securities Exchange (www.iseoptions.com), and the Boston Options
Exchange (www.bostonoptions.com). Options trade on several thousand diﬀerent
stocks. One contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares at the speciﬁed
strike price. This contract size is convenient because the shares themselves are normally
traded in lots of 100.
Foreign Currency Options
Most currency options trading is now in the over-the-counter market, but there is some
exchange trading. Exchanges trading foreign currency options in the United States
include NASDAQ OMX (www.nasdaqtrader.com), which acquired the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange in 2008. This exchange oﬀers European-style contracts on a variety of
diﬀerent currencies. One contract is to buy or sell 10,000 units of a foreign currency
(1,000,000 units in the case of the Japanese yen) for US dollars. Foreign currency
options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 17.
Index Options
Many diﬀerent index options currently trade throughout the world in both the over-the-
counter market and the exchange-traded market. The most popular exchange-traded
contracts in the United States are those on the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the S&P 100 Index
(OEX), the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), and the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJX). All
of these trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Most of the contracts are
European. An exception is the OEX contract on the S&P 100, which is American. One
contract is usually to buy or sell 100 times the index at the speciﬁed strike price.
Settlement is always in cash, rather than by delivering the portfolio underlying the
index. Consider, for example, one call contract on an index with a strike price of 980. If
it is exercised when the value of the index is 992, the writer of the contract pays the
holder ð992  980Þ  100 ¼ $1,200. Index options are discussed further in Chapter 17.
Futures Options
When an exchange trades a particular futures contract, it often also trades American
options on that contract. The life of a futures option normally ends a short period of time
before the expiration of trading in the underlying futures contract. When a call option is
exercised, the holder’s gain equals the excess of the futures price over the strike price.
When a put option is exercised, the holder’s gain equals the excess of the strike price over
the futures price. Futures options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 18.
10.4
SPECIFICATION OF STOCK OPTIONS
In the rest of this chapter, we will focus on stock options. As already mentioned, a
standard exchange-traded stock option in the United States is an American-style option
240
CHAPTER 10

contract to buy or sell 100 shares of the stock. Details of the contract (the expiration
date, the strike price, what happens when dividends are declared, how large a position
investors can hold, and so on) are speciﬁed by the exchange.
Expiration Dates
One of the items used to describe a stock option is the month in which the expiration
date occurs. Thus, a January call trading on IBM is a call option on IBM with an
expiration date in January. The precise expiration date is the Saturday immediately
following the third Friday of the expiration month. The last day on which options trade
is the third Friday of the expiration month. An investor with a long position in an
option normally has until 4:30 p.m. Central Time on that Friday to instruct a broker to
exercise the option. The broker then has until 10:59 p.m. the next day to complete the
paperwork notifying the exchange that exercise is to take place.
Stock options in the United States are on a January, February, or March cycle. The
January cycle consists of the months of January, April, July, and October. The
February cycle consists of the months of February, May, August, and November.
The March cycle consists of the months of March, June, September, and December.
If the expiration date for the current month has not yet been reached, options trade with
expiration dates in the current month, the following month, and the next two months in
the cycle. If the expiration date of the current month has passed, options trade with
expiration dates in the next month, the next-but-one month, and the next two months
of the expiration cycle. For example, IBM is on a January cycle. At the beginning of
January, options are traded with expiration dates in January, February, April, and July;
at the end of January, they are traded with expiration dates in February, March, April,
and July; at the beginning of May, they are traded with expiration dates in May, June,
July, and October; and so on. When one option reaches expiration, trading in another is
started. Longer-term options, known as LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation secu-
rities), also trade on many stocks in the United States. These have expiration dates up to
39 months into the future. The expiration dates for LEAPS on stocks are always in
January.
Strike Prices
The exchange normally chooses the strike prices at which options can be written so that
they are spaced $2.50, $5, or $10 apart. Typically the spacing is $2.50 when the stock
price is between $5 and $25, $5 when the stock price is between $25 and $200, and
$10 for stock prices above $200. As will be explained shortly, stock splits and stock
dividends can lead to nonstandard strike prices.
When a new expiration date is introduced, the two or three strike prices closest to the
current stock price are usually selected by the exchange. If the stock price moves outside
the range deﬁned by the highest and lowest strike price, trading is usually introduced in
an option with a new strike price. To illustrate these rules, suppose that the stock price
is $84 when trading begins in the October options. Call and put options would
probably ﬁrst be oﬀered with strike prices of $80, $85, and $90. If the stock price rose
above $90, it is likely that a strike price of $95 would be oﬀered; if it fell below $80, it is
likely that a strike price of $75 would be oﬀered; and so on.
Mechanics of Options Markets
241

Terminology
For any given asset at any given time, many diﬀerent option contracts may be trading.
Suppose there are four expiration dates and ﬁve strike prices for options on a particular
stock. If call and put options trade with every expiration date and every strike price, there
are a total of 40 diﬀerent contracts. All options of the same type (calls or puts) on a stock
are referred to as an option class. For example, IBM calls are one class, whereas IBM puts
are another class. An option series consists of all the options of a given class with the same
expiration date and strike price. In other words, it refers to a particular contract that is
traded. For example, IBM 200 October 2014 calls would constitute an option series.
Options are referred to as in the money, at the money, or out of the money. If S is the
stock price and K is the strike price, a call option is in the money when S > K, at the
money when S ¼ K, and out of the money when S < K. A put option is in the money
when S < K, at the money when S ¼ K, and out of the money when S > K. Clearly, an
option will be exercised only when it is in the money. In the absence of transaction
costs, an in-the-money option will always be exercised on the expiration date if it has
not been exercised previously.1
The intrinsic value of an option is deﬁned as the value it would have if there were no
time to maturity, so that the exercise decision had to be made immediately. For a call
option, the intrinsic value is therefore maxðS  K; 0Þ. For a put option, it is
maxðK  S; 0Þ. An in-the-money American option must be worth at least as much as
its intrinsic value because the holder has the right to exercise it immediately. Often it is
optimal for the holder of an in-the-money American option to wait rather than exercise
immediately. The option is then said to have time value. The total value of an option
can be thought of as the sum of its intrinsic value and its time value.
FLEX Options
The Chicago Board Options Exchange oﬀers FLEX (short for ﬂexible) options on
equities and equity indices. These are options where the traders agree to nonstandard
terms. These nonstandard terms can involve a strike price or an expiration date that is
diﬀerent from what is usually oﬀered by the exchange. They can also involve the option
being European rather than American. FLEX options are an attempt by option
exchanges to regain business from the over-the-counter markets. The exchange speciﬁes
a minimum size (e.g., 100 contracts) for FLEX option trades.
Other Nonstandard Products
In addition to ﬂex options, the CBOE trades a number of other nonstandard products.
Examples are:
1. Options on exchange-traded funds.2
2. Weeklys. These are options that are created on a Thursday and expire on Friday
of the following week.
1 Section 20.4 provides alternative deﬁnitions, often used by traders, for in the money, out of the money, and
at the money.
2 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become a popular alternative to mutual funds for investors. They are
traded like stocks and are designed so that their prices reﬂect the value of the assets of the fund closely.
242
CHAPTER 10

3. Binary options. These are options that provide a ﬁxed payoﬀof $100 if the strike
price is reached. For example, a binary call with a strike price of $50 provides a
payoﬀof $100 if the price of the underlying stock exceeds $50 on the expiry date;
a binary put with a strike price of $50 provides a payoﬀof $100 if the price of the
stock is below $50 on the expiry date. Binary options are discussed further in
Chapter 26.
4. Credit event binary options (CEBOs). These are options that provide a ﬁxed payoﬀ
if a particular company (known as the reference entity) suﬀers a ‘‘credit event’’ by
the maturity date. Credit events are deﬁned as bankruptcy, failure to pay interest
or principal on debt, and a restructuring of debt. Maturity dates are in December
of a particular year and payoﬀs, if any, are made on the maturity date. A CEBO is
a type of credit default swap (see Section 7.12 for an introduction to credit default
swaps and Chapter 25 for more details).
5. DOOM options. These are deep-out-of-the-money put options. Because they have
a low strike price, they cost very little. They provide a payoﬀonly if the price of
the underlying asset plunges. DOOM options provide the same sort of protection
as credit default swaps.
Dividends and Stock Splits
The early over-the-counter options were dividend protected. If a company declared a
cash dividend, the strike price for options on the company’s stock was reduced on the
ex-dividend day by the amount of the dividend. Exchange-traded options are not
usually adjusted for cash dividends. In other words, when a cash dividend occurs,
there are no adjustments to the terms of the option contract. An exception is sometimes
made for large cash dividends (see Business Snapshot 10.1).
Exchange-traded options are adjusted for stock splits. A stock split occurs when the
existing shares are ‘‘split’’ into more shares. For example, in a 3-for-1 stock split, three
new shares are issued to replace each existing share. Because a stock split does not
change the assets or the earning ability of a company, we should not expect it to have
any eﬀect on the wealth of the company’s shareholders. All else being equal, the 3-for-1
stock split should cause the stock price to go down to one-third of its previous value. In
general, an n-for-m stock split should cause the stock price to go down to m=n of its
previous value. The terms of option contracts are adjusted to reﬂect expected changes in
a stock price arising from a stock split. After an n-for-m stock split, the strike price is
reduced to m=n of its previous value, and the number of shares covered by one contract
is increased to n=m of its previous value. If the stock price declines in the way expected,
the positions of both the writer and the purchaser of a contract remain unchanged.
Example 10.1
Consider a call option to buy 100 shares of a company for $30 per share. Suppose
the company makes a 2-for-1 stock split. The terms of the option contract are then
changed so that it gives the holder the right to purchase 200 shares for $15 per share.
Stock options are adjusted for stock dividends. A stock dividend involves a company
issuing more shares to its existing shareholders. For example, a 20% stock dividend
means that investors receive one new share for each ﬁve already owned. A stock
dividend, like a stock split, has no eﬀect on either the assets or the earning power of
Mechanics of Options Markets
243

a company. The stock price can be expected to go down as a result of a stock dividend.
The 20% stock dividend referred to is essentially the same as a 6-for-5 stock split. All
else being equal, it should cause the stock price to decline to 5/6 of its previous value.
The terms of an option are adjusted to reﬂect the expected price decline arising from a
stock dividend in the same way as they are for that arising from a stock split.
Example 10.2
Consider a put option to sell 100 shares of a company for $15 per share. Suppose
the company declares a 25% stock dividend. This is equivalent to a 5-for-4 stock
split. The terms of the option contract are changed so that it gives the holder the
right to sell 125 shares for $12.
Adjustments are also made for rights issues. The basic procedure is to calculate the
theoretical price of the rights and then to reduce the strike price by this amount.
Position Limits and Exercise Limits
The Chicago Board Options Exchange often speciﬁes a position limit for option con-
tracts. This deﬁnes the maximum number of option contracts that an investor can hold on
one side of the market. For this purpose, long calls and short puts are considered to be on
the same side of the market. Also considered to be on the same side are short calls and
long puts. The exercise limit usually equals the position limit. It deﬁnes the maximum
number of contracts that can be exercised by any individual (or group of individuals
acting together) in any period of ﬁve consecutive business days. Options on the largest
and most frequently traded stocks have positions limits of 250,000 contracts. Smaller
capitalization stocks have position limits of 200,000, 75,000, 50,000, or 25,000 contracts.
Position limits and exercise limits are designed to prevent the market from being
unduly inﬂuenced by the activities of an individual investor or group of investors.
However, whether the limits are really necessary is a controversial issue.
Business Snapshot 10.1
Gucci Group’s Large Dividend
When there is a large cash dividend (typically one that is more than 10% of the stock
price), a committee of the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) at the Chicago Board
Options Exchange can decide to adjust the terms of options traded on the exchange.
On May 28, 2003, Gucci Group NV (GUC) declared a cash dividend of 13.50 euros
(approximately $15.88) per common share and this was approved at the annual
shareholders’ meeting on July 16, 2003. The dividend was about 16% of the share
price at the time it was declared. In this case, the OCC committee decided to adjust the
terms of options. The result was that the holder of a call contract paid 100 times the
strike price on exercise and received $1,588 of cash in addition to 100 shares; the holder
of a put contract received 100 times the strike price on exercise and delivered $1,588 of
cash in addition to 100 shares. These adjustments had the eﬀect of reducing the strike
price by $15.88.
Adjustments for large dividends are not always made. For example, Deutsche
Terminbo«rse chose not to adjust the terms of options traded on that exchange when
Daimler-Benz surprised the market on March 10, 1998, with a dividend equal to about
12% of its stock price.

CHAPTER 10

10.5
TRADING
Traditionally, exchanges have had to provide a large open area for individuals to meet
and trade options. This has changed. Most derivatives exchanges are fully electronic,
so traders do not have to physically meet. The International Securities Exchange
(www.iseoptions.com) launched the ﬁrst all-electronic options market for equities in
the United States in May 2000. Over 95% of the orders at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange are handled electronically. The remainder are mostly large or complex
institutional orders that require the skills of traders.
Market Makers
Most options exchanges use market makers to facilitate trading. A market maker for a
certain option is an individual who, when asked to do so, will quote both a bid and
an oﬀer price on the option. The bid is the price at which the market maker is
prepared to buy, and the oﬀer or asked is the price at which the market maker is
prepared to sell. At the time the bid and oﬀer prices are quoted, the market maker
does not know whether the trader who asked for the quotes wants to buy or sell the
option. The oﬀer is always higher than the bid, and the amount by which the oﬀer
exceeds the bid is referred to as the bid–oﬀer spread. The exchange sets upper limits
for the bid–oﬀer spread. For example, it might specify that the spread be no more
than $0.25 for options priced at less than $0.50, $0.50 for options priced between
$0.50 and $10, $0.75 for options priced between $10 and $20, and $1 for options
priced over $20.
The existence of the market maker ensures that buy and sell orders can always be
executed at some price without any delays. Market makers therefore add liquidity to the
market. The market makers themselves make their proﬁts from the bid–oﬀer spread.
They use methods such as those that will be discussed in Chapter 19 to hedge their risks.
Offsetting Orders
An investor who has purchased options can close out the position by issuing an
oﬀsetting order to sell the same number of options. Similarly, an investor who has
written options can close out the position by issuing an oﬀsetting order to buy the same
number of options. (In this respect options markets are similar to futures markets.) If,
when an option contract is traded, neither investor is closing an existing position, the
open interest increases by one contract. If one investor is closing an existing position
and the other is not, the open interest stays the same. If both investors are closing
existing positions, the open interest goes down by one contract.
10.6
COMMISSIONS
The types of orders that can be placed with a broker for options trading are similar to
those for futures trading (see Section 2.8). A market order is executed immediately, a limit
order speciﬁes the least favorable price at which the order can be executed, and so on.
For a retail investor, commissions vary signiﬁcantly from broker to broker. Discount
brokers generally charge lower commissions than full-service brokers. The actual
Mechanics of Options Markets
245

amount charged is often calculated as a ﬁxed cost plus a proportion of the dollar
amount of the trade. Table 10.1 shows the sort of schedule that might be oﬀered by a
discount broker. Using this schedule, the purchase of eight contracts when the option
price is $3 would cost $20 þ ð0:02  $2,400Þ ¼ $68 in commissions.
If an option position is closed out by entering into an oﬀsetting trade, the commis-
sion must be paid again. If the option is exercised, the commission is the same as it
would be if the investor placed an order to buy or sell the underlying stock.
Consider an investor who buys one call contract with a strike price of $50 when the
stock price is $49. We suppose the option price is $4.50, so that the cost of the contract
is $450. Under the schedule in Table 10.1, the purchase or sale of one contract always
costs $30 (both the maximum and minimum commission is $30 for the ﬁrst contract).
Suppose that the stock price rises and the option is exercised when the stock reaches
$60. Assuming that the investor pays 0.75% commission to exercise the option and a
further 0.75% commission to sell the stock, there is an additional cost of
2  0:0075  $60  100 ¼ $90
The total commission paid is therefore $120, and the net proﬁt to the investor is
$1,000  $450  $120 ¼ $430
Note that selling the option for $10 instead of exercising it would save the investor $60
in commissions. (The commission payable when an option is sold is only $30 in our
example.) As this example indicates, the commission system can push retail investors in
the direction of selling options rather than exercising them.
A hidden cost in option trading (and in stock trading) is the market maker’s bid–oﬀer
spread. Suppose that, in the example just considered, the bid price was $4.00 and the
oﬀer price was $4.50 at the time the option was purchased. We can reasonably assume
that a ‘‘fair’’ price for the option is halfway between the bid and the oﬀer price, or $4.25.
The cost to the buyer and to the seller of the market maker system is the diﬀerence
between the fair price and the price paid. This is $0.25 per option, or $25 per contract.
10.7
MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
When shares are purchased in the United States, an investor can borrow up to 50% of
the price from the broker. This is known as buying on margin. If the share price declines

contract.
246
CHAPTER 10

so that the loan is substantially more than 50% of the stock’s current value, there is a
‘‘margin call’’, where the broker requests that cash be deposited by the investor. If the
margin call is not met, the broker sells the stock.
When call and put options with maturities less than 9 months are purchased, the
option price must be paid in full. Investors are not allowed to buy these options on
margin because options already contain substantial leverage and buying on margin
would raise this leverage to an unacceptable level. For options with maturities greater
than 9 months investors can buy on margin, borrowing up to 25% of the option value.
A trader who writes options is required to maintain funds in a margin account. Both
the trader’s broker and the exchange want to be satisﬁed that the trader will not default
if the option is exercised. The amount of margin required depends on the trader’s
position.
Writing Naked Options
A naked option is an option that is not combined with an oﬀsetting position in the
underlying stock. The initial and maintenance margin required by the CBOE for a
written naked call option is the greater of the following two calculations:
1. A total of 100% of the proceeds of the sale plus 20% of the underlying share
price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out of the money
2. A total of 100% of the option proceeds plus 10% of the underlying share price.
For a written naked put option, it is the greater of
1. A total of 100% of the proceeds of the sale plus 20% of the underlying share
price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out of the money
2. A total of 100% of the option proceeds plus 10% of the exercise price.
The 20% in the preceding calculations is replaced by 15% for options on a broadly
based stock index because a stock index is usually less volatile than the price of an
individual stock.
Example 10.3
An investor writes four naked call option contracts on a stock. The option price is
$5, the strike price is $40, and the stock price is $38. Because the option is $2 out
of the money, the ﬁrst calculation gives
400  ð5 þ 0:2  38  2Þ ¼ $4,240
The second calculation gives
400  ð5 þ 0:1  38Þ ¼ $3,520
The initial margin requirement is therefore $4,240. Note that, if the option had
been a put, it would be $2 in the money and the margin requirement would be
400  ð5 þ 0:2  38Þ ¼ $5,040
In both cases, the proceeds of the sale can be used to form part of the margin
account.
Mechanics of Options Markets
247

A calculation similar to the initial margin calculation (but with the current market price
of the contract replacing the proceeds of sale) is repeated every day. Funds can be
withdrawn from the margin account when the calculation indicates that the margin
required is less than the current balance in the margin account. When the calculation
indicates that a greater margin is required, a margin call will be made.
Other Rules
In Chapter 12, we will examine option trading strategies such as covered calls, protective
puts, spreads, combinations, straddles, and strangles. The CBOE has special rules for
determining the margin requirements when these trading strategies are used. These are
described in the CBOE Margin Manual, which is available on the CBOE website
(www.cboe. com).
As an example of the rules, consider an investor who writes a covered call. This is a
written call option when the shares that might have to be delivered are already owned.
Covered calls are far less risky than naked calls, because the worst that can happen is
that the investor is required to sell shares already owned at below their market value.
No margin is required on the written option. However, the investor can borrow an
amount equal to 0:5 minðS; KÞ, rather than the usual 0:5S, on the stock position.
10.8
THE OPTIONS CLEARING CORPORATION
The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) performs much the same function for options
markets as the clearing house does for futures markets (see Chapter 2). It guarantees
that options writers will fulﬁll their obligations under the terms of options contracts and
keeps a record of all long and short positions. The OCC has a number of members, and
all option trades must be cleared through a member. If a broker is not itself a member of
an exchange’s OCC, it must arrange to clear its trades with a member. Members are
required to have a certain minimum amount of capital and to contribute to a special
fund that can be used if any member defaults on an option obligation.
The funds used to purchase an option must be deposited with the OCC by the
morning of the business day following the trade. The writer of the option maintains a
margin account with a broker, as described earlier.3 The broker maintains a margin
account with the OCC member that clears its trades. The OCC member in turn
maintains a margin account with the OCC.
Exercising an Option
When an investor instructs a broker to exercise an option, the broker notiﬁes the OCC
member that clears its trades. This member then places an exercise order with the OCC.
The OCC randomly selects a member with an outstanding short position in the same
option. The member, using a procedure established in advance, selects a particular
investor who has written the option. If the option is a call, this investor is required to
sell stock at the strike price. If it is a put, the investor is required to buy stock at the
3 The margin requirements described in the previous section are the minimum requirements speciﬁed by the
OCC. A broker may require a higher margin from its clients. However, it cannot require a lower margin.
Some brokers do not allow their retail clients to write uncovered options at all.
248
CHAPTER 10

strike price. The investor is said to be assigned. The buy/sell transaction takes place on
the third business day following the exercise order. When an option is exercised, the
open interest goes down by one.
At the expiration of the option, all in-the-money options should be exercised unless
the transaction costs are so high as to wipe out the payoﬀfrom the option. Some
brokers will automatically exercise options for a client at expiration when it is in their
client’s interest to do so. Many exchanges also have rules for exercising options that are
in the money at expiration.
10.9
REGULATION
Options markets are regulated in a number of diﬀerent ways. Both the exchange and
Options Clearing Corporations have rules governing the behavior of traders. In addi-
tion, there are both federal and state regulatory authorities. In general, options markets
have demonstrated a willingness to regulate themselves. There have been no major
scandals or defaults by OCC members. Investors can have a high level of conﬁdence in
the way the market is run.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is responsible for regulating options
markets in stocks, stock indices, currencies, and bonds at the federal level. The Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission is responsible for regulating markets for options on
futures. The major options markets are in the states of Illinois and New York. These
states actively enforce their own laws on unacceptable trading practices.
10.10
TAXATION
Determining the tax implications of option trading strategies can be tricky, and an
investor who is in doubt about this should consult a tax specialist. In the United States,
the general rule is that (unless the taxpayer is a professional trader) gains and losses
from the trading of stock options are taxed as capital gains or losses. The way that
capital gains and losses are taxed in the United States was discussed in Section 2.10.
For both the holder and the writer of a stock option, a gain or loss is recognized when
(a) the option expires unexercised or (b) the option position is closed out. If the option
is exercised, the gain or loss from the option is rolled into the position taken in the
stock and recognized when the stock position is closed out. For example, when a call
option is exercised, the party with a long position is deemed to have purchased the
stock at the strike price plus the call price. This is then used as a basis for calculating
this party’s gain or loss when the stock is eventually sold. Similarly, the party with the
short call position is deemed to have sold the stock at the strike price plus the call price.
When a put option is exercised, the seller of the option is deemed to have bought the
stock for the strike price less the original put price and the purchaser of the option is
deemed to have sold the stock for the strike price less the original put price.
Wash Sale Rule
One tax consideration in option trading in the United States is the wash sale rule. To
understand this rule, imagine an investor who buys a stock when the price is $60 and
Mechanics of Options Markets
249

plans to keep it for the long term. If the stock price drops to $40, the investor might be
tempted to sell the stock and then immediately repurchase it, so that the $20 loss is
realized for tax purposes. To prevent this practice, the tax authorities have ruled that
when the repurchase is within 30 days of the sale (i.e., between 30 days before the sale
and 30 days after the sale), any loss on the sale is not deductible. The disallowance also
applies where, within the 61-day period, the taxpayer enters into an option or similar
contract to acquire the stock. Thus, selling a stock at a loss and buying a call option
within a 30-day period will lead to the loss being disallowed.
Constructive Sales
Prior to 1997, if a United States taxpayer shorted a security while holding a long
position in a substantially identical security, no gain or loss was recognized until the
short position was closed out. This means that short positions could be used to defer
recognition of a gain for tax purposes. The situation was changed by the Tax Relief Act
of 1997. An appreciated property is now treated as ‘‘constructively sold’’ when the
owner does one of the following:
1. Enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property
2. Enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially
identical property
3. Enters into one or more positions that eliminate substantially all of the loss and
opportunity for gain.
It should be noted that transactions reducing only the risk of loss or only the opportun-
ity for gain should not result in constructive sales. Therefore an investor holding a long
position in a stock can buy in-the-money put options on the stock without triggering a
constructive sale.
Tax practitioners sometimes use options to minimize tax costs or maximize tax
beneﬁts (see Business Snapshot 10.2). Tax authorities in many jurisdictions have
proposed legislation designed to combat the use of derivatives for tax purposes. Before

Tax Planning Using Options
As a simple example of a possible tax planning strategy using options, suppose that
Country A has a tax regime where the tax is low on interest and dividends and high on
capital gains, while Country B has a tax regime where tax is high on interest and
dividends and low on capital gains. It is advantageous for a company to receive the
income from a security in Country A and the capital gain, if there is one, in Country B.
The company would like to keep capital losses in Country A, where they can be used to
oﬀset capital gains on other items. All of this can be accomplished by arranging for a
subsidiary company in Country A to have legal ownership of the security and for a
subsidiary company in Country B to buy a call option on the security from the
company in Country A, with the strike price of the option equal to the current value
of the security. During the life of the option, income from the security is earned in
Country A. If the security price rises sharply, the option will be exercised and the
capital gain will be realized in Country B. If it falls sharply, the option will not be
exercised and the capital loss will be realized in Country A.

entering into any tax-motivated transaction, a corporate treasurer or private individual
should explore in detail how the structure could be unwound in the event of legislative
change and how costly this process could be.
10.11
WARRANTS, EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, AND CONVERTIBLES
Warrants are options issued by a ﬁnancial institution or nonﬁnancial corporation. For
example, a ﬁnancial institution might issue put warrants on one million ounces of gold
and then proceed to create a market for the warrants. To exercise the warrant, the
holder would contact the ﬁnancial institution. A common use of warrants by a
nonﬁnancial corporation is at the time of a bond issue. The corporation issues call
warrants on its own stock and then attaches them to the bond issue to make it more
attractive to investors.
Employee stock options are call options issued to employees by their company to
motivate them to act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders (see Chap-
ter 16). They are usually at the money at the time of issue. They are now a cost on the
income statement of the company in most countries.
Convertible bonds, often referred to as convertibles, are bonds issued by a company
that can be converted into equity at certain times using a predetermined exchange ratio.
They are therefore bonds with an embedded call option on the company’s stock.
One feature of warrants, employee stock options, and convertibles is that a predeter-
mined number of options are issued. By contrast, the number of options on a particular
stock that trade on the CBOE or another exchange is not predetermined. As people take
positions in a particular option series, the number of options outstanding increases; as
people close out positions, it declines. Warrants issued by a company on its own stock,
employee stock options, and convertibles are diﬀerent from exchange-traded options in
another important way. When these instruments are exercised, the company issues more
shares of its own stock and sells them to the option holder for the strike price. The
exercise of the instruments therefore leads to an increase in the number of shares of the
company’s stock that are outstanding. By contrast, when an exchange-traded call option
is exercised, the party with the short position buys in the market shares that have already
been issued and sells them to the party with the long position for the strike price. The
company whose stock underlies the option is not involved in any way.
10.12
OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTIONS MARKETS
Most of this chapter has focused on exchange-traded options markets. The over-the-
counter market for options has become increasingly important since the early 1980s
and is now larger than the exchange-traded market. As explained in Chapter 1, the
main participants in over-the-counter markets are ﬁnancial institutions, corporate
treasurers, and fund managers. There is a wide range of assets underlying the options.
Over-the-counter options on foreign exchange and interest rates are particularly
popular. The chief potential disadvantage of the over-the-counter market is that the
option writer may default. This means that the purchaser is subject to some credit risk.
In an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, market participants (and regulators) often
require counterparties to post collateral. This was discussed in Section 2.5.
Mechanics of Options Markets
251

The instruments traded in the over-the-counter market are often structured by
ﬁnancial institutions to meet the precise needs of their clients. Sometimes this involves
choosing exercise dates, strike prices, and contract sizes that are diﬀerent from those
oﬀered by an exchange. In other cases the structure of the option is diﬀerent from
standard calls and puts. The option is then referred to as an exotic option. Chapter 26
describes a number of diﬀerent types of exotic options.
SUMMARY
There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to
buy the underlying asset for a certain price by a certain date. A put option gives the
holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. There
are four possible positions in options markets: a long position in a call, a short position
in a call, a long position in a put, and a short position in a put. Taking a short position
in an option is known as writing it. Options are currently traded on stocks, stock
indices, foreign currencies, futures contracts, and other assets.
An exchange must specify the terms of the option contracts it trades. In particular, it
must specify the size of the contract, the precise expiration time, and the strike price. In
the United States one stock option contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100
shares. The expiration of a stock option contract is 10:59 p.m. Central Time on the
Saturday immediately following the third Friday of the expiration month. Options with
several diﬀerent expiration months trade at any given time. Strike prices are at $2 1
2, $5,
or $10 intervals, depending on the stock price. The strike price is generally fairly close
to the stock price when trading in an option begins.
The terms of a stock option are not normally adjusted for cash dividends. However,
they are adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, and rights issues. The aim of the
adjustment is to keep the positions of both the writer and the buyer of a contract
unchanged.
Most option exchanges use market makers. A market maker is an individual who is
prepared to quote both a bid price (at which he or she is prepared to buy) and an oﬀer
price (at which he or she is prepared to sell). Market makers improve the liquidity of the
market and ensure that there is never any delay in executing market orders. They
themselves make a proﬁt from the diﬀerence between their bid and oﬀer prices (known as
their bid–oﬀer spread). The exchange has rules specifying upper limits for the bid–oﬀer
spread.
Writers of options have potential liabilities and are required to maintain a margin
account with their brokers. If it is not a member of the Options Clearing Corporation,
the broker will maintain a margin account with a ﬁrm that is a member. This ﬁrm will
in turn maintain a margin account with the Options Clearing Corporation. The
Options Clearing Corporation is responsible for keeping a record of all outstanding
contracts, handling exercise orders, and so on.
Not all options are traded on exchanges. Many options are traded in the over-the-
counter (OTC) market. An advantage of over-the-counter options is that they can be
tailored by a ﬁnancial institution to meet the particular needs of a corporate treasurer or
fund manager.

Closing price
The number of shares covered by each stock option outstanding was adjusted upward to
Number of shares predividend 

‘‘Closing Price’’ means the oﬃcial NASDAQ closing price of a share of Microsoft
common stock on the last trading day before the ex-dividend date. Evaluate this adjust-
ment. Compare it with the system used by exchanges to adjust for extraordinary dividends
(see Business Snapshot 10.1).

Properties of
Stock Options
In this chapter, we look at the factors aﬀecting stock option prices. We use a number
of diﬀerent arbitrage arguments to explore the relationships between European option
prices, American option prices, and the underlying stock price. The most important of
these relationships is put–call parity, which is a relationship between the price of a
European call option, the price of a European put option, and the underlying stock
price.
The chapter examines whether American options should be exercised early. It shows
that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying
stock prior to the option’s expiration, but that under some circumstances the early
exercise of an American put option on such a stock is optimal. When there are
dividends, it can be optimal to exercise either calls or puts early.
11.1
FACTORS AFFECTING OPTION PRICES
There are six factors aﬀecting the price of a stock option:
1. The current stock price, S0
2. The strike price, K
3. The time to expiration, T
4. The volatility of the stock price, 
5. The risk-free interest rate, r
6. The dividends that are expected to be paid.
In this section, we consider what happens to option prices when there is a change to one
of these factors, with all the other factors remaining ﬁxed. The results are summarized
in Table 11.1.
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 show how European call and put prices depend on the ﬁrst ﬁve
factors in the situation where S0 ¼ 50, K ¼ 50, r ¼ 5% per annum,  ¼ 30% per
annum, T ¼ 1 year, and there are no dividends. In this case the call price is 7:116
and the put price is 4:677.
256

C H A P T E R

Stock Price and Strike Price
If a call option is exercised at some future time, the payoﬀwill be the amount by which
the stock price exceeds the strike price. Call options therefore become more valuable as
the stock price increases and less valuable as the strike price increases. For a put option,
the payoﬀon exercise is the amount by which the strike price exceeds the stock price.
Put options therefore behave in the opposite way from call options: they become less
valuable as the stock price increases and more valuable as the strike price increases.
Figure 11.1a–d illustrate the way in which put and call prices depend on the stock price
and strike price.
Time to Expiration
Now consider the eﬀect of the expiration date. Both put and call American options
become more valuable (or at least do not decrease in value) as the time to expiration
increases. Consider two American options that diﬀer only as far as the expiration date is
concerned. The owner of the long-life option has all the exercise opportunities open to
the owner of the short-life option—and more. The long-life option must therefore
always be worth at least as much as the short-life option.
Although European put and call options usually become more valuable as the time
to expiration increases (see Figure 11.1e, f), this is not always the case. Consider two
European call options on a stock: one with an expiration date in 1 month, the other
with an expiration date in 2 months. Suppose that a very large dividend is expected in
6 weeks. The dividend will cause the stock price to decline, so that the short-life option
could be worth more than the long-life option.1
Volatility
The precise way in which volatility is deﬁned is discussed in Chapter 15. Roughly
speaking, the volatility of a stock price is a measure of how uncertain we are about

future stock price movements. As volatility increases, the chance that the stock will do
very well or very poorly increases. For the owner of a stock, these two outcomes tend to
oﬀset each other. However, this is not so for the owner of a call or put. The owner of a
call beneﬁts from price increases but has limited downside risk in the event of price
decreases because the most the owner can lose is the price of the option. Similarly, the
owner of a put beneﬁts from price decreases, but has limited downside risk in the event
of price increases. The values of both calls and puts therefore increase as volatility
increases (see Figure 11.2a, b).

CHAPTER 11

Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free interest rate aﬀects the price of an option in a less clear-cut way. As interest
rates in the economy increase, the expected return required by investors from the stock
tends to increase. In addition, the present value of any future cash ﬂow received by the
holder of the option decreases. The combined impact of these two eﬀects is to increase the
value of call options and decrease the value of put options (see Figure 11.2c, d).
It is important to emphasize that we are assuming that interest rates change while all
other variables stay the same. In particular we are assuming in Table 11.1 that interest
rates change while the stock price remains the same. In practice, when interest rates rise
(fall), stock prices tend to fall (rise). The combined eﬀect of an interest rate increase and
the accompanying stock price decrease can be to decrease the value of a call option and
increase the value of a put option. Similarly, the combined eﬀect of an interest rate
decrease and the accompanying stock price increase can be to increase the value of a
call option and decrease the value of a put option.
Amount of Future Dividends
Dividends have the eﬀect of reducing the stock price on the ex-dividend date. This is
bad news for the value of call options and good news for the value of put options.

Consider a dividend whose ex-dividend date is during the life of an option. The value of
the option is negatively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a call and
positively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a put.
11.2
ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION
In this chapter, we will make assumptions similar to those made when deriving forward
and futures prices in Chapter 5. We assume that there are some market participants,
such as large investment banks, for which the following statements are true:
1. There are no transaction costs.
2. All trading proﬁts (net of trading losses) are subject to the same tax rate.
3. Borrowing and lending are possible at the risk-free interest rate.
We assume that these market participants are prepared to take advantage of arbitrage
opportunities as they arise. As discussed in Chapters 1 and 5, this means that any
available arbitrage opportunities disappear very quickly. For the purposes of our
analysis, it is therefore reasonable to assume that there are no arbitrage opportunities.
We will use the following notation:
S0: Current stock price
K: Strike price of option
T : Time to expiration of option
ST : Stock price on the expiration date
r: Continuously compounded risk-free rate of interest for an investment maturing
in time T
C: Value of American call option to buy one share
P: Value of American put option to sell one share
c: Value of European call option to buy one share
p: Value of European put option to sell one share
It should be noted that r is the nominal rate of interest, not the real rate of interest. We
can assume that r > 0. Otherwise, a risk-free investment would provide no advantages
over cash. (Indeed, if r < 0, cash would be preferable to a risk-free investment.)
11.3
UPPER AND LOWER BOUNDS FOR OPTION PRICES
In this section, we derive upper and lower bounds for option prices. These bounds do
not depend on any particular assumptions about the factors mentioned in Section 11.1
(except r > 0). If an option price is above the upper bound or below the lower bound,
then there are proﬁtable opportunities for arbitrageurs.
Upper Bounds
An American or European call option gives the holder the right to buy one share of a
stock for a certain price. No matter what happens, the option can never be worth more
260
CHAPTER 11

than the stock. Hence, the stock price is an upper bound to the option price:
c 6 S0
and
C 6 S0
ð11:1Þ
If these relationships were not true, an arbitrageur could easily make a riskless proﬁt by
buying the stock and selling the call option.
An American put option gives the holder the right to sell one share of a stock for K.
No matter how low the stock price becomes, the option can never be worth more
than K. Hence,
P 6 K
ð11:2Þ
For European options, we know that at maturity the option cannot be worth more
than K. It follows that it cannot be worth more than the present value of K today:
p 6 KerT
ð11:3Þ
If this were not true, an arbitrageur could make a riskless proﬁt by writing the option
and investing the proceeds of the sale at the risk-free interest rate.
Lower Bound for Calls on Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks
A lower bound for the price of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is
S0  KerT
We ﬁrst look at a numerical example and then consider a more formal argument.
Suppose that S0 ¼ $20, K ¼ $18, r ¼ 10% per annum, and T ¼ 1 year. In this case,
S0  KerT ¼ 20  18e0:1 ¼ 3:71
or $3.71. Consider the situation where the European call price is $3.00, which is less
than the theoretical minimum of $3.71. An arbitrageur can short the stock and buy the
call to provide a cash inﬂow of $20:00  $3:00 ¼ $17:00. If invested for 1 year at 10%
per annum, the $17.00 grows to 17e0:1 ¼ $18:79. At the end of the year, the option
expires. If the stock price is greater than $18.00, the arbitrageur exercises the option for
$18.00, closes out the short position, and makes a proﬁt of
$18:79  $18:00 ¼ $0:79
If the stock price is less than $18.00, the stock is bought in the market and the short
position is closed out. The arbitrageur then makes an even greater proﬁt. For example,
if the stock price is $17.00, the arbitrageur’s proﬁt is
$18:79  $17:00 ¼ $1:79
For a more formal argument, we consider the following two portfolios:
Portfolio A: one European call option plus a zero-coupon bond that provides a
payoﬀof K at time T
Portfolio B: one share of the stock.
Properties of Stock Options
261

In portfolio A, the zero-coupon bond will be worth K at time T. If ST > K, the call
option is exercised at maturity and portfolio A is worth ST. If ST < K, the call option
expires worthless and the portfolio is worth K. Hence, at time T, portfolio A is worth
maxðST; KÞ
Portfolio B is worth ST at time T. Hence, portfolio A is always worth as much as, and
can be worth more than, portfolio B at the option’s maturity. It follows that in the
absence of arbitrage opportunities this must also be true today. The zero-coupon bond
is worth KerT today. Hence,
c þ KerT > S0
or
c > S0  KerT
Because the worst that can happen to a call option is that it expires worthless, its value
cannot be negative. This means that c > 0 and therefore
c > maxðS0  KerT; 0Þ
ð11:4Þ
Example 11.1
Consider a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock
price is $51, the strike price is $50, the time to maturity is 6 months, and the risk-free
interest rate is 12% per annum. In this case, S0 ¼ 51, K ¼ 50, T ¼ 0:5, and r ¼ 0:12.
From equation (11.4), a lower bound for the option price is S0  KerT, or
51  50e0:120:5 ¼ $3:91
Lower Bound for European Puts on Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks
For a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, a lower bound for the
price is
KerT  S0
Again, we ﬁrst consider a numerical example and then look at a more formal argument.
Suppose that S0 ¼ $37, K ¼ $40, r ¼ 5% per annum, and T ¼ 0:5 years. In this case,
KerT  S0 ¼ 40e0:050:5  37 ¼ $2:01
Consider the situation where the European put price is $1.00, which is less than the
theoretical minimum of $2.01. An arbitrageur can borrow $38.00 for 6 months to buy
both the put and the stock. At the end of the 6 months, the arbitrageur will be required
to repay 38e0:050:5 ¼ $38:96. If the stock price is below $40.00, the arbitrageur exercises
the option to sell the stock for $40.00, repays the loan, and makes a proﬁt of
$40:00  $38:96 ¼ $1:04
If the stock price is greater than $40.00, the arbitrageur discards the option, sells the
stock, and repays the loan for an even greater proﬁt. For example, if the stock price is
$42.00, the arbitrageur’s proﬁt is
$42:00  $38:96 ¼ $3:04
262
CHAPTER 11

For a more formal argument, we consider the following two portfolios:
Portfolio C: one European put option plus one share
Portfolio D: a zero-coupon bond paying oﬀK at time T.
If ST < K, then the option in portfolio C is exercised at option maturity and the
portfolio becomes worth K. If ST > K, then the put option expires worthless and the
portfolio is worth ST at this time. Hence, portfolio C is worth
maxðST; KÞ
in time T. Portfolio D is worth K in time T. Hence, portfolio C is always worth as much
as, and can sometimes be worth more than, portfolio D in time T. It follows that in the
absence of arbitrage opportunities portfolio C must be worth at least as much as
portfolio D today. Hence,
p þ S0 > KerT
or
p > KerT  S0
Because the worst that can happen to a put option is that it expires worthless, its value
cannot be negative. This means that
p > maxðKerT  S0; 0Þ
ð11:5Þ
Example 11.2
Consider a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock
price is $38, the strike price is $40, the time to maturity is 3 months, and the
risk-free rate of interest is 10% per annum. In this case S0 ¼ 38, K ¼ 40,
T ¼ 0:25, and r ¼ 0:10. From equation (11.5), a lower bound for the option
price is KerT  S0, or
40e0:10:25  38 ¼ $1:01
11.4
PUT–CALL PARITY
We now derive an important relationship between the prices of European put and call
options that have the same strike price and time to maturity. Consider the following two
portfolios that were used in the previous section:
Portfolio A : one European call option plus a zero-coupon bond that provides a
payoﬀof K at time T
Portfolio C : one European put option plus one share of the stock.
We continue to assume that the stock pays no dividends. The call and put options have
the same strike price K and the same time to maturity T.
As discussed in the previous section, the zero-coupon bond in portfolio A will be
worth K at time T. If the stock price ST at time T proves to be above K, then the call
option in portfolio A will be exercised. This means that portfolio A is worth
ðST  KÞ þ K ¼ ST at time T in these circumstances. If ST proves to be less than K,
then the call option in portfolio A will expire worthless and the portfolio will be
worth K at time T.
Properties of Stock Options
263

In portfolio C, the share will be worth ST at time T. If ST proves to be below K, then
the put option in portfolio C will be exercised. This means that portfolio C is worth
ðK  STÞ þ ST ¼ K at time T in these circumstances. If ST proves to be greater than K,
then the put option in portfolio C will expire worthless and the portfolio will be worth
ST at time T.
The situation is summarized in Table 11.2. If ST > K, both portfolios are worth ST at
time T; if ST < K, both portfolios are worth K at time T. In other words, both are worth
maxðST; KÞ
when the options expire at time T. Because they are European, the options cannot be
exercised prior to time T. Since the portfolios have identical values at time T, they must
have identical values today. If this were not the case, an arbitrageur could buy the less
expensive portfolio and sell the more expensive one. Because the portfolios are
guaranteed to cancel each other out at time T, this trading strategy would lock in an
arbitrage proﬁt equal to the diﬀerence in the values of the two portfolios.
The components of portfolio A are worth c and KerT today, and the components of
portfolio C are worth p and S0 today. Hence,
c þ KerT ¼ p þ S0
ð11:6Þ
This relationship is known as put–call parity. It shows that the value of a European call
with a certain exercise price and exercise date can be deduced from the value of a
European put with the same exercise price and exercise date, and vice versa.
To illustrate the arbitrage opportunities when equation (11.6) does not hold, suppose
that the stock price is $31, the exercise price is $30, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per
annum, the price of a three-month European call option is $3, and the price of a
3-month European put option is $2.25. In this case,
c þ KerT ¼ 3 þ 30e0:13=12 ¼ $32:26
p þ S0 ¼ 2:25 þ 31 ¼ $33:25
Portfolio C is overpriced relative to portfolio A. An arbitrageur can buy the securities
in portfolio A and short the securities in portfolio C. The strategy involves buying the
call and shorting both the put and the stock, generating a positive cash ﬂow of
3 þ 2:25 þ 31 ¼ $30:25

up front. When invested at the risk-free interest rate, this amount grows to
30:25e0:10:25 ¼ $31:02
in three months. If the stock price at expiration of the option is greater than $30, the
call will be exercised. If it is less than $30, the put will be exercised. In either case, the
arbitrageur ends up buying one share for $30. This share can be used to close out the
short position. The net proﬁt is therefore
$31:02  $30:00 ¼ $1:02
For an alternative situation, suppose that the call price is $3 and the put price is $1.
In this case,
c þ KerT ¼ 3 þ 30e0:13=12 ¼ $32:26
p þ S0 ¼ 1 þ 31 ¼ $32:00
Portfolio A is overpriced relative to portfolio C. An arbitrageur can short the securities in
portfolio A and buy the securities in portfolio C to lock in a proﬁt. The strategy involves
shorting the call and buying both the put and the stock with an initial investment of
$31 þ $1  $3 ¼ $29
When the investment is ﬁnanced at the risk-free interest rate, a repayment of
29e0:10:25 ¼ $29:73 is required at the end of the three months. As in the previous case,
either the call or the put will be exercised. The short call and long put option position
therefore leads to the stock being sold for $30.00. The net proﬁt is therefore
$30:00  $29:73 ¼ $0:27
These examples are illustrated in Table 11.3. Business Snapshot 11.1 shows how options

and put–call parity can help us understand the positions of the debt holders and equity
holders in a company.
American Options
Put–call parity holds only for European options. However, it is possible to derive some
results for American option prices. It can be shown (see Problem 11.18) that, when
there are no dividends,

Business Snapshot 11.1
Put–Call Parity and Capital Structure
Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton were the pioneers of option
pricing. In the early 1970s, they also showed that options can be used to characterize
the capital structure of a company. Today this analysis is widely used by ﬁnancial
institutions to assess a company’s credit risk.
To illustrate the analysis, consider a company that has assets that are ﬁnanced with
zero-coupon bonds and equity. Suppose that the bonds mature in ﬁve years at which
time a principal payment of K is required. The company pays no dividends. If the
assets are worth more than K in ﬁve years, the equity holders choose to repay the
bond holders. If the assets are worth less than K, the equity holders choose to declare
bankruptcy and the bond holders end up owning the company.
The value of the equity in ﬁve years is therefore maxðAT  K; 0Þ; where AT is the
value of the company’s assets at that time. This shows that the equity holders have a
ﬁve-year European call option on the assets of the company with a strike price of K.
What about the bondholders? They get minðAT; KÞ in ﬁve years. This is the same as
K  maxðK  AT; 0Þ. This shows that today the bonds are worth the present value
of K minus the value of a ﬁve-year European put option on the assets with a strike
price of K.
To summarize, if c and p are the values, respectively, of the call and put options
on the company’s assets, then
Value of company’s equity ¼ c
Value of company’s debt ¼ PVðKÞ  p
Denote the value of the assets of the company today by A0. The value of the assets
must equal the total value of the instruments used to ﬁnance the assets. This means
that it must equal the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt, so that
A0 ¼ c þ ½PVðKÞ  p
Rearranging this equation, we have
c þ PVðKÞ ¼ p þ A0
This is the put–call parity result in equation (11.6) for call and put options on the
assets of the company.

$19.00 and the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum. From equation (11.7), we
have
19  20 6 C  P 6 19  20e0:15=12
or
1 > P  C > 0:18
showing that P  C lies between $1.00 and $0.18. With C at $1.50, P must lie
between $1.68 and $2.50. In other words, upper and lower bounds for the price of
an American put with the same strike price and expiration date as the American
call are $2.50 and $1.68.
11.5
CALLS ON A NON-DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK
In this section, we ﬁrst show that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option
on a non-dividend-paying stock before the expiration date.
To illustrate the general nature of the argument, consider an American call option on
a non-dividend-paying stock with one month to expiration when the stock price is $70
and the strike price is $40. The option is deep in the money, and the investor who owns
the option might well be tempted to exercise it immediately. However, if the investor
plans to hold the stock obtained by exercising the option for more than one month, this
is not the best strategy. A better course of action is to keep the option and exercise it at
the end of the month. The $40 strike price is then paid out one month later than it
would be if the option were exercised immediately, so that interest is earned on the $40
for one month. Because the stock pays no dividends, no income from the stock is
sacriﬁced. A further advantage of waiting rather than exercising immediately is that
there is some chance (however remote) that the stock price will fall below $40 in one
month. In this case the investor will not exercise in one month and will be glad that the
decision to exercise early was not taken!
This argument shows that there are no advantages to exercising early if the investor
plans to keep the stock for the remaining life of the option (one month, in this case).
What if the investor thinks the stock is currently overpriced and is wondering whether
to exercise the option and sell the stock? In this case, the investor is better oﬀselling the
option than exercising it.2 The option will be bought by another investor who does
want to hold the stock. Such investors must exist. Otherwise the current stock price
would not be $70. The price obtained for the option will be greater than its intrinsic
value of $30, for the reasons mentioned earlier.
For a more formal argument, we can use equation (11.4):
c > S0  KerT
Because the owner of an American call has all the exercise opportunities open to the
owner of the corresponding European call, we must have C > c. Hence,
C > S0  KerT
Given r > 0, it follows that C > S0  K when T > 0. This means that C is always greater
2 As an alternative strategy, the investor can keep the option and short the stock to lock in a better proﬁt
than $10.
Properties of Stock Options
267

than the option’s intrinsic value prior to maturity. If it were optimal to exercise at a
particular time prior to maturity, C would equal the option’s intrinsic value at that
time. It follows that it can never be optimal to exercise early.
To summarize, there are two reasons an American call on a non-dividend-paying
stock should not be exercised early. One relates to the insurance that it provides. A call
option, when held instead of the stock itself, in eﬀect insures the holder against the
stock price falling below the strike price. Once the option has been exercised and the
strike price has been exchanged for the stock price, this insurance vanishes. The other
reason concerns the time value of money. From the perspective of the option holder,
the later the strike price is paid out the better.
Bounds
Because American call options are never exercised early when there are no dividends,
they are equivalent to European call options, so that C ¼ c. From equations (11.1)
and (11.4), it follows that lower and upper bounds are given by
maxðS0  KerT; 0Þ
and
S0
respectively. These bounds are illustrated in Figure 11.3.
The general way in which the call price varies with the stock price, S0, is shown in
Figure 11.4. As r or T or the stock price volatility increases, the line relating the call
price to the stock price moves in the direction indicated by the arrows.
11.6
PUTS ON A NON-DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK
It can be optimal to exercise an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock
early. Indeed, at any given time during its life, the put option should always be exercised
early if it is suﬃciently deep in the money.
To illustrate, consider an extreme situation. Suppose that the strike price is $10 and
the stock price is virtually zero. By exercising immediately, an investor makes an
immediate gain of $10. If the investor waits, the gain from exercise might be less than
$10, but it cannot be more than $10, because negative stock prices are impossible.

CHAPTER 11

Furthermore, receiving $10 now is preferable to receiving $10 in the future. It follows
that the option should be exercised immediately.
Like a call option, a put option can be viewed as providing insurance. A put option,
when held in conjunction with the stock, insures the holder against the stock price
falling below a certain level. However, a put option is diﬀerent from a call option in that
it may be optimal for an investor to forgo this insurance and exercise early in order to
realize the strike price immediately. In general, the early exercise of a put option
becomes more attractive as S0 decreases, as r increases, and as the volatility decreases.
Bounds
From equations (11.3) and (11.5), lower and upper bounds for a European put option
when there are no dividends are given by
maxðKerT  S0; 0Þ 6 p 6 KerT
For an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, the condition
P > maxðK  S0; 0Þ
must apply because the option can be exercised at any time. This is a stronger
condition than the one for a European put option in equation (11.5). Using the result
in equation (11.2), bounds for an American put option on a non-dividend-paying
stock are
maxðK  S0; 0Þ 6 P 6 K
Figure 11.5 illustrates the bounds.
Figure 11.6 shows the general way in which the price of an American put option
varies with S0. As we argued earlier, provided that r > 0, it is always optimal to exercise
an American put immediately when the stock price is suﬃciently low. When early
exercise is optimal, the value of the option is K  S0. The curve representing the value

of the put therefore merges into the put’s intrinsic value, K  S0, for a suﬃciently small
value of S0. In Figure 11.6, this value of S0 is shown as point A. The line relating the put
price to the stock price moves in the direction indicated by the arrows when r decreases,
when the volatility increases, and when T increases.
Because there are some circumstances when it is desirable to exercise an American
put option early, it follows that an American put option is always worth more than the
corresponding European put option. Furthermore, because an American put is some-
times worth its intrinsic value (see Figure 11.6), it follows that a European put option
must sometimes be worth less than its intrinsic value. This means that the curve
representing the relationship between the put price and the stock price for a European
option must be below the corresponding curve for an American option.
Figure 11.7 shows the variation of the European put price with the stock price. Note
that point B in Figure 11.7, at which the price of the option is equal to its intrinsic
value, must represent a higher value of the stock price than point A in Figure 11.6
because the curve in Figure 11.7 is below that in Figure 11.6. Point E in Figure 11.7 is

11.7
EFFECT OF DIVIDENDS
The results produced so far in this chapter have assumed that we are dealing with
options on a non-dividend-paying stock. In this section, we examine the impact of
dividends. We assume that the dividends that will be paid during the life of the option
are known. Most exchange-traded stock options have a life of less than one year, so this
assumption is often not too unreasonable. We will use D to denote the present value of
the dividends during the life of the option. In the calculation of D, a dividend is
assumed to occur at the time of its ex-dividend date.
Lower Bound for Calls and Puts
We can redeﬁne portfolios A and B as follows:
Portfolio A: one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to D þ KerT
Portfolio B: one share
A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.4) shows that
c > maxðS0  D  KerT; 0Þ
ð11:8Þ
We can also redeﬁne portfolios C and D as follows:
Portfolio C: one European put option plus one share
Portfolio D: an amount of cash equal to D þ KerT

Early Exercise
When dividends are expected, we can no longer assert that an American call option will
not be exercised early. Sometimes it is optimal to exercise an American call immediately
prior to an ex-dividend date. It is never optimal to exercise a call at other times. This
point is discussed further in Section 15.12.
Put–Call Parity
Comparing the value at option maturity of the redeﬁned portfolios A and C shows that,
with dividends, the put–call parity result in equation (11.6) becomes
c þ D þ KerT ¼ p þ S0
ð11:10Þ
Dividends cause equation (11.7) to be modiﬁed (see Problem 11.19) to

SUMMARY
There are six factors aﬀecting the value of a stock option: the current stock price, the
strike price, the expiration date, the stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and
the dividends expected during the life of the option. The value of a call usually increases
as the current stock price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the risk-free interest
rate increase. The value of a call decreases as the strike price and expected dividends
increase. The value of a put usually increases as the strike price, the time to expiration,
the volatility, and the expected dividends increase. The value of a put decreases as the
current stock price and the risk-free interest rate increase.
It is possible to reach some conclusions about the value of stock options without
making any assumptions about the volatility of stock prices. For example, the price of a
call option on a stock must always be worth less than the price of the stock itself.
Similarly, the price of a put option on a stock must always be worth less than the
option’s strike price.
A European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be worth more than
maxðS0  KerT; 0Þ
where S0 is the stock price, K is the strike price, r is the risk-free interest rate, and T is
the time to expiration. A European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be
worth more than
maxðKerT  S0; 0Þ
When dividends with present value D will be paid, the lower bound for a European call
option becomes
maxðS0  D  KerT; 0Þ
and the lower bound for a European put option becomes
maxðKerT þ D  S0; 0Þ
272
CHAPTER 11

Put–call parity is a relationship between the price, c, of a European call option on a
stock and the price, p, of a European put option on a stock. For a non-dividend-paying
stock, it is
c þ KerT ¼ p þ S0
For a dividend-paying stock, the put–call parity relationship is
c þ D þ KerT ¼ p þ S0
Put–call parity does not hold for American options. However, it is possible to use
arbitrage arguments to obtain upper and lower bounds for the diﬀerence between the
price of an American call and the price of an American put.
In Chapter 15, we will carry the analyses in this chapter further by making speciﬁc
assumptions about the probabilistic behavior of stock prices. The analysis will enable us
to derive exact pricing formulas for European stock options. In Chapters 13 and 21, we
will see how numerical procedures can be used to price American options.

Trading Strategies
Involving Options
We discussed the proﬁt pattern from an investment in a single option in Chapter 10. In
this chapter we look at what can be achieved when an option is traded in conjunction
with other assets. In particular, we examine the properties of portfolios consisting of
(a) an option and a zero-coupon bond, (b) an option and the asset underlying the
option, and (c) two or more options on the same asset.
A natural question is why a trader would want the proﬁt patterns discussed here. The
answer is that the choices a trader makes depend on the trader’s judgment about how
prices will move and the trader’s willingness to take risks. Principal-protected notes,
discussed in Section 12.1 appeal to individuals who are risk-averse. They do not want to
risk losing their principal, but have an opinion about whether a particular asset will
increase or decrease in value and are prepared to let the return on principal depend on
whether they are right. If a trader is willing to take rather more risk than this, he or she
could choose a bull or bear spread, discussed in Section 12.3. Yet more risk would be
taken with a straightforward long position in a call or put option.
Suppose that a trader feels there will be a big move in price of an asset, but does not
know whether this will be up or down. There are a number of alternative trading
strategies. A risk-averse trader might choose a reverse butterﬂy spread, discussed in
Section 12.3, where there will be a small gain if the trader’s hunch is correct and a small
loss if it is not. A more aggressive investor might choose a straddle or strangle,
discussed in Section 12.4, where potential gains and losses are larger.
Further trading strategies involving options are considered in later chapters. For
example, Chapter 17 shows how options on stock indices can be used to manage the
risks in a stock portfolio and explains how range forward contracts can be used to
hedge a foreign exchange exposure; Chapter 19 covers the way in which Greek letters
are used to manage the risks when derivatives are traded; Chapter 26 covers exotic
options and what is known as static options replication.
12.1
PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES
Options are often used to create what are termed principal-protected notes for the retail
market. These are products that appeal to conservative investors. The return earned by
the investor depends on the performance of a stock, a stock index, or other risky asset,
276
12
C H A P T E R

but the initial principal amount invested is not at risk. An example will illustrate how a
simple principal-protected note can be created.
Example 12.1
Suppose that the 3-year interest rate is 6% with continuous compounding. This
means that 1,000e0:063 ¼ $835:27 will grow to $1,000 in 3 years. The diﬀerence
between $1,000 and $835.27 is $164.73. Suppose that a stock portfolio is worth
$1,000 and provides a dividend yield of 1.5% per annum. Suppose further that a
3-year at-the-money European call option on the stock portfolio can be purchased
for less than $164.73. (From DerivaGem, it can be veriﬁed that this will be the
case if the volatility of the value of the portfolio is less than about 15%.) A bank
can oﬀer clients a $1,000 investment opportunity consisting of:
1. A 3-year zero-coupon bond with a principal of $1,000
2. A 3-year at-the-money European call option on the stock portfolio.
If the value of the porfolio increases the investor gets whatever $1,000 invested in
the portfolio would have grown to. (This is because the zero-coupon bond pays
oﬀ$1,000 and this equals the strike price of the option.) If the value of the
portfolio goes down, the option has no value, but payoﬀfrom the zero-coupon
bond ensures that the investor receives the original $1,000 principal invested.
The attraction of a principal-protected note is that an investor is able to take a risky
position without risking any principal. The worst that can happen is that the investor
loses the chance to earn interest, or other income such as dividends, on the initial
investment for the life of the note.
There are many variations on the product we have described. An investor who thinks
that the price of an asset will decline can buy a principal-protected note consisting of a
zero-coupon bond plus a put option. The investor’s payoﬀin 3 years is then $1,000 plus
the payoﬀ(if any) from the put option.
Is a principal-protected note a good deal from the retail investor’s perspective? A
bank will always build in a proﬁt for itself when it creates a principal-protected note.
This means that, in Example 12.1, the zero-coupon bond plus the call option will always
cost the bank less than $1,000. In addition, investors are taking the risk that the bank
will not be in a position to make the payoﬀon the principal-protected note at maturity.
(Some retail investors lost money on principal-protected notes created by Lehman
Brothers when it failed in 2008.) In some situations, therefore, an investor will be
better oﬀif he or she buys the underlying option in the usual way and invests the
remaining principal in a risk-free investment. However, this is not always the case. The
investor is likely to face wider bid–oﬀer spreads on the option than the bank and is
likely to earn lower interest rates than the bank. It is therefore possible that the bank
can add value for the investor while making a proﬁt itself.
Now let us look at the principal-protected notes from the perspective of the bank. The
economic viability of the structure in Example 12.1 depends critically on the level of
interest rates and the volatility of the portfolio. If the interest rate is 3% instead of 6%,
the bank has only 1,000  1,000e0:033 ¼ $86:07 with which to buy the call option. If
interest rates are 6%, but the volatility is 25% instead of 15%, the price of the option
would be about $221. In either of these circumstances, the product described in
Example 12.1 cannot be proﬁtably created by the bank. However, there are a number
Trading Strategies Involving Options
277

of ways the bank can still create a viable 3-year product. For example, the strike price of
the option can be increased so that the value of the portfolio has to rise by, say, 15%
before the investor makes a gain; the investor’s return could be capped; the return of the
investor could depend on the average price of the asset instead of the ﬁnal price; a
knockout barrier could be speciﬁed. The derivatives involved in some of these alter-
natives will be discussed later in the book. (Capping the option corresponds to the
creation of a bull spread for the investor and will be discussed later in this chapter.)
One way in which a bank can sometimes create a proﬁtable principal-protected note
when interest rates are low or volatilities are high is by increasing its life. Consider the
situation in Example 12.1 when (a) the interest rate is 3% rather than 6% and (b) the
stock portfolio has a volatility of 15% and provides a dividend yield of 1.5%.
DerivaGem shows that a 3-year at-the-money European option costs about $119. This
is more than the funds available to purchase it (1,000  1,000e0:033 ¼ $86:07). A
10-year at-the-money option costs about $217. This is less than the funds available to
purchase it (1,000  1,000e0:0310 ¼ $259:18), making the structure proﬁtable. When
the life is increased to 20 years, the option cost is about $281, which is much less than
the funds available to purchase it (1,000  1,000e0:0320 ¼ $451:19), so that the struc-
ture is even more proﬁtable.
A critical variable for the bank in our example is the dividend yield. The higher it is,
the more proﬁtable the product is for the bank. If the dividend yield were zero, the
principal-protected note in Example 12.1 cannot be proﬁtable for the bank no matter
how long it lasts. (This follows from equation (11.4).)
12.2
TRADING AN OPTION AND THE UNDERLYING ASSET
For convenience, we will assume that the asset underlying the options considered in the
rest of the chapter is a stock. (Similar trading strategies can be developed for other
underlying assets.) We will also follow the usual practice of calculating the proﬁt from a
trading strategy as the ﬁnal payoﬀminus the initial cost without any discounting.
There are a number of diﬀerent trading strategies involving a single option on a stock
and the stock itself. The proﬁts from these are illustrated in Figure 12.1. In this ﬁgure
and in other ﬁgures throughout this chapter, the dashed line shows the relationship
between proﬁt and the stock price for the individual securities constituting the
portfolio, whereas the solid line shows the relationship between proﬁt and the stock
price for the whole portfolio.
In Figure 12.1a, the portfolio consists of a long position in a stock plus a short
position in a European call option. This is known as writing a covered call. The long
stock position ‘‘covers’’ or protects the investor from the payoﬀon the short call that
becomes necessary if there is a sharp rise in the stock price. In Figure 12.1b, a short
position in a stock is combined with a long position in a call option. This is the reverse
of writing a covered call. In Figure 12.1c, the investment strategy involves buying a
European put option on a stock and the stock itself. This is referred to as a protective
put strategy. In Figure 12.1d, a short position in a put option is combined with a short
position in the stock. This is the reverse of a protective put.
The proﬁt patterns in Figures 12.1a, b, c, d have the same general shape as the proﬁt
patterns discussed in Chapter 10 for short put, long put, long call, and short call,
278
CHAPTER 12

respectively. Put–call parity provides a way of understanding why this is so. From
Chapter 11, the put–call parity relationship is
p þ S0 ¼ c þ KerT þ D
ð12:1Þ
where p is the price of a European put, S0 is the stock price, c is the price of a European
call, K is the strike price of both call and put, r is the risk-free interest rate, T is the time
to maturity of both call and put, and D is the present value of the dividends anticipated
during the life of the options.

Equation (12.1) shows that a long position in a European put combined with a long
position in the stock is equivalent to a long European call position plus a certain
amount (¼ KerT þ D) of cash. This explains why the proﬁt pattern in Figure 12.1c is
similar to the proﬁt pattern from a long call position. The position in Figure 12.1d is the
reverse of that in Figure 12.1c and therefore leads to a proﬁt pattern similar to that from
a short call position.
Equation (12.1) can be rearranged to become
S0  c ¼ KerT þ D  p
This shows that a long position in a stock combined with a short position in a
European call is equivalent to a short European put position plus a certain amount
(¼ KerT þ D) of cash. This equality explains why the proﬁt pattern in Figure 12.1a is
similar to the proﬁt pattern from a short put position. The position in Figure 12.1b is
the reverse of that in Figure 12.1a and therefore leads to a proﬁt pattern similar to that
from a long put position.
12.3
SPREADS
A spread trading strategy involves taking a position in two or more options of the same
type (i.e., two or more calls or two or more puts).
Bull Spreads
One of the most popular types of spreads is a bull spread. This can be created by buying
a European call option on a stock with a certain strike price and selling a European call
option on the same stock with a higher strike price. Both options have the same
expiration date. The strategy is illustrated in Figure 12.2. The proﬁts from the two
option positions taken separately are shown by the dashed lines. The proﬁt from the
whole strategy is the sum of the proﬁts given by the dashed lines and is indicated by the
solid line. Because a call price always decreases as the strike price increases, the value of
the option sold is always less than the value of the option bought. A bull spread, when
created from calls, therefore requires an initial investment.
Suppose that K1 is the strike price of the call option bought, K2 is the strike price of

280
CHAPTER 12

the call option sold, and ST is the stock price on the expiration date of the options.
Table 12.1 shows the total payoﬀthat will be realized from a bull spread in diﬀerent
circumstances. If the stock price does well and is greater than the higher strike price, the
payoﬀis the diﬀerence between the two strike prices, or K2  K1. If the stock price on
the expiration date lies between the two strike prices, the payoﬀis ST  K1. If the stock
price on the expiration date is below the lower strike price, the payoﬀis zero. The proﬁt
in Figure 12.2 is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the payoﬀ.
A bull spread strategy limits the investor’s upside as well as downside risk. The strategy
can be described by saying that the investor has a call option with a strike price equal to
K1 and has chosen to give up some upside potential by selling a call option with strike
price K2 ðK2 > K1Þ. In return for giving up the upside potential, the investor gets the
price of the option with strike price K2. Three types of bull spreads can be distinguished:
1. Both calls are initially out of the money.
2. One call is initially in the money; the other call is initially out of the money.
3. Both calls are initially in the money.
The most aggressive bull spreads are those of type 1. They cost very little to set up and
have a small probability of giving a relatively high payoﬀ(¼ K2  K1). As we move
from type 1 to type 2 and from type 2 to type 3, the spreads become more conservative.
Example 12.2
An investor buys for $3 a 3-month European call with a strike price of $30 and
sells for $1 a 3-month European call with a strike price of $35. The payoﬀfrom
this bull spread strategy is $5 if the stock price is above $35, and zero if it is
below $30. If the stock price is between $30 and $35, the payoﬀis the amount by
which the stock price exceeds $30. The cost of the strategy is $3  $1 ¼ $2. So the
proﬁt is:

Bull spreads can also be created by buying a European put with a low strike price and
selling a European put with a high strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.3. Unlike bull
spreads created from calls, those created from puts involve a positive up-front cash
ﬂow to the investor (ignoring margin requirements) and a payoﬀthat is either negative
or zero.

Bear Spreads
An investor who enters into a bull spread is hoping that the stock price will increase. By
contrast, an investor who enters into a bear spread is hoping that the stock price will
decline. Bear spreads can be created by buying a European put with one strike price and
selling a European put with another strike price. The strike price of the option
purchased is greater than the strike price of the option sold. (This is in contrast to a
bull spread, where the strike price of the option purchased is always less than the strike
price of the option sold.) In Figure 12.4, the proﬁt from the spread is shown by the solid
line. A bear spread created from puts involves an initial cash outﬂow because the price
of the put sold is less than the price of the put purchased. In essence, the investor has
bought a put with a certain strike price and chosen to give up some of the proﬁt
potential by selling a put with a lower strike price. In return for the proﬁt given up, the
investor gets the price of the option sold.
Assume that the strike prices are K1 and K2, with K1 < K2. Table 12.2 shows the
payoﬀthat will be realized from a bear spread in diﬀerent circumstances. If the stock

price is greater than K2, the payoﬀis zero. If the stock price is less than K1, the payoﬀis
K2  K1. If the stock price is between K1 and K2, the payoﬀis K2  ST. The proﬁt is
calculated by subtracting the initial cost from the payoﬀ.
Example 12.3
An investor buys for $3 a 3-month European put with a strike price of $35 and sells
for $1 a 3-month European put with a strike price of $30. The payoﬀfrom this bear
spread strategy is zero if the stock price is above $35, and $5 if it is below $30. If the
stock price is between $30 and $35, the payoﬀis 35  ST. The options cost
$3  $1 ¼ $2 up front. So the proﬁt is:

Like bull spreads, bear spreads limit both the upside proﬁt potential and the downside
risk. Bear spreads can be created using calls instead of puts. The investor buys a call
with a high strike price and sells a call with a low strike price, as illustrated in
Figure 12.5. Bear spreads created with calls involve an initial cash inﬂow (ignoring
margin requirements).

Box Spreads
A box spread is a combination of a bull call spread with strike prices K1 and K2 and a
bear put spread with the same two strike prices. As shown in Table 12.3, the payoﬀ
from a box spread is always K2  K1. The value of a box spread is therefore always the
present value of this payoﬀor ðK2  K1ÞerT. If it has a diﬀerent value there is an
arbitrage opportunity. If the market price of the box spread is too low, it is proﬁtable to
buy the box. This involves buying a call with strike price K1, buying a put with strike
price K2, selling a call with strike price K2, and selling a put with strike price K1. If the
market price of the box spread is too high, it is proﬁtable to sell the box. This involves
buying a call with strike price K2, buying a put with strike price K1, selling a call with
strike price K1, and selling a put with strike price K2.
It is important to realize that a box-spread arbitrage only works with European
options. Many of the options that trade on exchanges are American. As shown in
Business Snapshot 12.1, inexperienced traders who treat American options as European
are liable to lose money.
Butterﬂy Spreads
A butterﬂy spread involves positions in options with three diﬀerent strike prices. It can
be created by buying a European call option with a relatively low strike price K1,

CHAPTER 12

Business Snapshot 12.1
Losing Money with Box Spreads
Suppose that a stock has a price of $50 and a volatility of 30%. No dividends are
expected and the risk-free rate is 8%. A trader oﬀers you the chance to sell on the
CBOE a 2-month box spread where the strike prices are $55 and $60 for $5.10.
Should you do the trade?
The trade certainly sounds attractive. In this case K1 ¼ 55, K2 ¼ 60, and the payoﬀ
is certain to be $5 in 2 months. By selling the box spread for $5.10 and investing the
funds for 2 months you would have more than enough funds to meet the $5 payoﬀin
2 months. The theoretical value of the box spread today is 5  e0:082=12 ¼ $4:93.
Unfortunately there is a snag. CBOE stock options are American and the $5 payoﬀ
from the box spread is calculated on the assumption that the options comprising the
box are European. Option prices for this example (calculated using DerivaGem) are
shown in the table below. A bull call spread where the strike prices are $55 and $60
costs 0:96  0:26 ¼ $0:70. (This is the same for both European and American options
because, as we saw in Chapter 11, the price of a European call is the same as the price of
an American call when there are no dividends.) A bear put spread with the same strike
prices costs 9:46  5:23 ¼ $4:23 if the options are European and 10:00  5:44 ¼ $4:56
if they are American. The combined value of both spreads if they are created with
European options is 0:70 þ 4:23 ¼ $4:93. This is the theoretical box spread price
calculated above. The combined value of buying both spreads if they are American is
0:70 þ 4:56 ¼ $5:26. Selling a box spread created with American options for $5.10
would not be a good trade. You would realize this almost immediately as the trade
involves selling a $60 strike put and this would be exercised against you almost as soon
as you sold it!

buying a European call option with a relatively high strike price K3, and selling two
European call options with a strike price K2 that is halfway between K1 and K3.
Generally, K2 is close to the current stock price. The pattern of proﬁts from the strategy
is shown in Figure 12.6. A butterﬂy spread leads to a proﬁt if the stock price stays close
to K2, but gives rise to a small loss if there is a signiﬁcant stock price move in either
direction. It is therefore an appropriate strategy for an investor who feels that large
stock price moves are unlikely. The strategy requires a small investment initially. The
payoﬀfrom a butterﬂy spread is shown in Table 12.4.
Suppose that a certain stock is currently worth $61. Consider an investor who feels
that a signiﬁcant price move in the next 6 months is unlikely. Suppose that the market
prices of 6-month European calls are as follows:
Strike price ($ )
Call price ($)
55
10
60
7
65
5
The investor could create a butterﬂy spread by buying one call with a $55 strike price,
buying one call with a $65 strike price, and selling two calls with a $60 strike price. It
costs $10 þ $5  ð2  $7Þ ¼ $1 to create the spread. If the stock price in 6 months is
greater than $65 or less than $55, the total payoﬀis zero, and the investor incurs a net
loss of $1. If the stock price is between $56 and $64, a proﬁt is made. The maximum
proﬁt, $4, occurs when the stock price in 6 months is $60.
Butterﬂy spreads can be created using put options. The investor buys two European
puts, one with a low strike price and one with a high strike price, and sells two
European puts with an intermediate strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. The
butterﬂy spread in the example considered above would be created by buying one put
with a strike price of $55, another with a strike price of $65, and selling two puts with a
strike price of $60. The use of put options results in exactly the same spread as the use
of call options. Put–call parity can be used to show that the initial investment is the
same in both cases.

CHAPTER 12

A butterﬂy spread can be sold or shorted by following the reverse strategy. Options
are sold with strike prices of K1 and K3, and two options with the middle strike price K2
are purchased. This strategy produces a modest proﬁt if there is a signiﬁcant movement
in the stock price.
Calendar Spreads
Up to now we have assumed that the options used to create a spread all expire at the
same time. We now move on to calendar spreads in which the options have the same
strike price and diﬀerent expiration dates.
A calendar spread can be created by selling a European call option with a certain
strike price and buying a longer-maturity Eurpean call option with the same strike price.
The longer the maturity of an option, the more expensive it usually is. A calendar spread
therefore usually requires an initial investment. Proﬁt diagrams for calendar spreads are
usually produced so that they show the proﬁt when the short-maturity option expires on
the assumption that the long-maturity option is closed out at that time. The proﬁt
pattern for a calendar spread produced from call options is shown in Figure 12.8. The
pattern is similar to the proﬁt from the butterﬂy spread in Figure 12.6. The investor
makes a proﬁt if the stock price at the expiration of the short-maturity option is close to
the strike price of the short-maturity option. However, a loss is incurred when the stock
price is signiﬁcantly above or signiﬁcantly below this strike price.
To understand the proﬁt pattern from a calendar spread, ﬁrst consider what happens
if the stock price is very low when the short-maturity option expires. The short-maturity
option is worthless and the value of the long-maturity option is close to zero. The
investor therefore incurs a loss that is close to the cost of setting up the spread initially.
Consider next what happens if the stock price, ST, is very high when the short-maturity
option expires. The short-maturity option costs the investor ST  K, and the long-
maturity option is worth close to ST  K, where K is the strike price of the options.
Again, the investor makes a net loss that is close to the cost of setting up the spread

initially. If ST is close to K, the short-maturity option costs the investor either a small
amount or nothing at all. However, the long-maturity option is still quite valuable. In
this case a signiﬁcant net proﬁt is made.
In a neutral calendar spread, a strike price close to the current stock price is chosen.
A bullish calendar spread involves a higher strike price, whereas a bearish calendar
spread involves a lower strike price.
Calendar spreads can be created with put options as well as call options. The investor
buys a long-maturity put option and sells a short-maturity put option. As shown in
Figure 12.9, the proﬁt pattern is similar to that obtained from using calls.
A reverse calendar spread is the opposite to that in Figures 12.8 and 12.9. The investor
buys a short-maturity option and sells a long-maturity option. A small proﬁt arises if
the stock price at the expiration of the short-maturity option is well above or well below
the strike price of the short-maturity option. However, a loss results if it is close to the
strike price.
Diagonal Spreads
Bull, bear, and calendar spreads can all be created from a long position in one call and
a short position in another call. In the case of bull and bear spreads, the calls have
diﬀerent strike prices and the same expiration date. In the case of calendar spreads, the
calls have the same strike price and diﬀerent expiration dates.
In a diagonal spread both the expiration date and the strike price of the calls are
diﬀerent. This increases the range of proﬁt patterns that are possible.
12.4
COMBINATIONS
A combination is an option trading strategy that involves taking a position in both
calls and puts on the same stock. We will consider straddles, strips, straps, and
strangles.

CHAPTER 12

Straddle
One popular combination is a straddle, which involves buying a European call and put
with the same strike price and expiration date. The proﬁt pattern is shown in Figure 12.10.
The strike price is denoted by K. If the stock price is close to this strike price at expiration
of the options, the straddle leads to a loss. However, if there is a suﬃciently large move in
either direction, a signiﬁcant proﬁt will result. The payoﬀfrom a straddle is calculated in
Table 12.5.
A straddle is appropriate when an investor is expecting a large move in a stock price
but does not know in which direction the move will be. Consider an investor who feels
that the price of a certain stock, currently valued at $69 by the market, will move
signiﬁcantly in the next 3 months. The investor could create a straddle by buying both a
put and a call with a strike price of $70 and an expiration date in 3 months. Suppose
that the call costs $4 and the put costs $3. If the stock price stays at $69, it is easy to see
that the strategy costs the investor $6. (An up-front investment of $7 is required, the call
expires worthless, and the put expires worth $1.) If the stock price moves to $70, a loss
of $7 is experienced. (This is the worst that can happen.) However, if the stock price
jumps up to $90, a proﬁt of $13 is made; if the stock moves down to $55, a proﬁt of $8
is made; and so on. As discussed in Business Snapshot 12.2 an investor should carefully
consider whether the jump that he or she anticipates is already reﬂected in option prices
before putting on a straddle trade.
The straddle in Figure 12.10 is sometimes referred to as a bottom straddle or straddle
purchase. A top straddle or straddle write is the reverse position. It is created by selling a
call and a put with the same exercise price and expiration date. It is a highly risky strategy.

If the stock price on the expiration date is close to the strike price, a proﬁt results.
However, the loss arising from a large move is unlimited.
Strips and Straps
A strip consists of a long position in one European call and two European puts with the
same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of a long position in two
European calls and one European put with the same strike price and expiration date.
The proﬁt patterns from strips and straps are shown in Figure 12.11. In a strip the
investor is betting that there will be a big stock price move and considers a decrease in
the stock price to be more likely than an increase. In a strap the investor is also betting
that there will be a big stock price move. However, in this case, an increase in the stock
price is considered to be more likely than a decrease.
Business Snapshot 12.2
How to Make Money from Trading Straddles
Suppose that a big move is expected in a company’s stock price because there is a
takeover bid for the company or the outcome of a major lawsuit involving the
company is about to be announced. Should you trade a straddle?
A straddle seems a natural trading strategy in this case. However, if your view of the
company’s situation is much the same as that of other market participants, this view
will be reﬂected in the prices of options. Options on the stock will be signiﬁcantly more
expensive than options on a similar stock for which no jump is expected. The V-shaped
proﬁt pattern from the straddle in Figure 12.10 will have moved downward, so that a
bigger move in the stock price is necessary for you to make a proﬁt.
For a straddle to be an eﬀective strategy, you must believe that there are likely to be
big movements in the stock price and these beliefs must be diﬀerent from those of
most other investors. Market prices incorporate the beliefs of market participants. To
make money from any investment strategy, you must take a view that is diﬀerent from
most of the rest of the market—and you must be right!

CHAPTER 12

Strangles
In a strangle, sometimes called a bottom vertical combination, an investor buys a
European put and a European call with the same expiration date and diﬀerent strike
prices. The proﬁt pattern is shown in Figure 12.12. The call strike price, K2, is higher than
the put strike price, K1. The payoﬀfunction for a strangle is calculated in Table 12.6.
A strangle is a similar strategy to a straddle. The investor is betting that there will be a
large price move, but is uncertain whether it will be an increase or a decrease.
Comparing Figures 12.12 and 12.10, we see that the stock price has to move farther
in a strangle than in a straddle for the investor to make a proﬁt. However, the downside
risk if the stock price ends up at a central value is less with a strangle.
The proﬁt pattern obtained with a strangle depends on how close together the strike
prices are. The farther they are apart, the less the downside risk and the farther the
stock price has to move for a proﬁt to be realized.
The sale of a strangle is sometimes referred to as a top vertical combination. It can be
appropriate for an investor who feels that large stock price moves are unlikely. However,
as with sale of a straddle, it is a risky strategy involving unlimited potential loss to the
investor.

expiring at time T were available with every single possible strike price, any payoﬀ
function at time T could in theory be obtained. The easiest illustration of this involves
butterﬂy spreads. Recall that a butterﬂy spread is created by buying options with strike
prices K1 and K3 and selling two options with strike price K2, where K1 < K2 < K3 and
K3  K2 ¼ K2  K1. Figure 12.13 shows the payoﬀfrom a butterﬂy spread. The pattern
could be described as a spike. As K1 and K3 move closer together, the spike becomes
smaller. Through the judicious combination of a large number of very small spikes, any
payoﬀfunction can be approximated as accurately as desired.
SUMMARY
Principal-protected notes can be created from a zero-coupon bond and a European call
option. They are attractive to some investors because the issuer of the product
guarantees that the purchaser will receive his or her principal back regardless of the
performance of the asset underlying the option.
A number of common trading strategies involve a single option and the underlying
stock. For example, writing a covered call involves buying the stock and selling a call
option on the stock; a protective put involves buying a put option and buying the stock.
The former is similar to selling a put option; the latter is similar to buying a call option.
Spreads involve either taking a position in two or more calls or taking a position in
two or more puts. A bull spread can be created by buying a call (put) with a low strike
price and selling a call (put) with a high strike price. A bear spread can be created by
buying a put (call) with a high strike price and selling a put (call) with a low strike price.
A butterﬂy spread involves buying calls (puts) with a low and high strike price and
selling two calls (puts) with some intermediate strike price. A calendar spread involves
selling a call (put) with a short time to expiration and buying a call (put) with a longer
time to expiration. A diagonal spread involves a long position in one option and a short
position in another option such that both the strike price and the expiration date are
diﬀerent.
Combinations involve taking a position in both calls and puts on the same stock. A
straddle combination involves taking a long position in a call and a long position in a
put with the same strike price and expiration date. A strip consists of a long position in
one call and two puts with the same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of
a long position in two calls and one put with the same strike price and expiration date.
A strangle consists of a long position in a call and a put with diﬀerent strike prices and
the same expiration date. There are many other ways in which options can be used to

Binomial Trees
A useful and very popular technique for pricing an option involves constructing a
binomial tree. This is a diagram representing diﬀerent possible paths that might be
followed by the stock price over the life of an option. The underlying assumption is that
the stock price follows a random walk. In each time step, it has a certain probability of
moving up by a certain percentage amount and a certain probability of moving down by
a certain percentage amount. In the limit, as the time step becomes smaller, this model
is the same as the Black–Scholes–Merton model we will be discussing in Chapter 15.
Indeed, in the appendix to this chapter, we show that the European option price given
by the binomial tree converges to the Black–Scholes–Merton price as the time step
becomes smaller.
The material in this chapter is important for a number of reasons. First, it explains the
nature of the no-arbitrage arguments that are used for valuing options. Second, it
explains the binomial tree numerical procedure that is widely used for valuing American
options and other derivatives. Third, it introduces a very important principle known as
risk-neutral valuation.
The general approach to constructing trees in this chapter is the one used in an
important paper published by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979. More details on
numerical procedures using binomial trees are given in Chapter 21.
13.1
A ONE-STEP BINOMIAL MODEL AND A NO-ARBITRAGE
ARGUMENT
We start by considering a very simple situation. A stock price is currently $20, and it is
known that at the end of 3 months it will be either $22 or $18. We are interested in
valuing a European call option to buy the stock for $21 in 3 months. This option will
have one of two values at the end of the 3 months. If the stock price turns out to be $22,
the value of the option will be $1; if the stock price turns out to be $18, the value of the
option will be zero. The situation is illustrated in Figure 13.1.
It turns out that a relatively simple argument can be used to price the option in this
example. The only assumption needed is that arbitrage opportunities do not exist. We
set up a portfolio of the stock and the option in such a way that there is no uncertainty
296

C H A P T E R

about the value of the portfolio at the end of the 3 months. We then argue that, because
the portfolio has no risk, the return it earns must equal the risk-free interest rate. This
enables us to work out the cost of setting up the portfolio and therefore the option’s
price. Because there are two securities (the stock and the stock option) and only two
possible outcomes, it is always possible to set up the riskless portfolio.
Consider a portfolio consisting of a long position in  shares of the stock and a short
position in one call option ( is the Greek capital letter ‘‘delta’’). We calculate the value
of  that makes the portfolio riskless. If the stock price moves up from $20 to $22, the
value of the shares is 22 and the value of the option is 1, so that the total value of the
portfolio is 22  1. If the stock price moves down from $20 to $18, the value of the
shares is 18 and the value of the option is zero, so that the total value of the portfolio
is 18. The portfolio is riskless if the value of  is chosen so that the ﬁnal value of the
portfolio is the same for both alternatives. This means that
22  1 ¼ 18
or
 ¼ 0:25
A riskless portfolio is therefore
Long: 0.25 shares
Short: 1 option.
If the stock price moves up to $22, the value of the portfolio is
22  0:25  1 ¼ 4:5
If the stock price moves down to $18, the value of the portfolio is
18  0:25 ¼ 4:5
Regardless of whether the stock price moves up or down, the value of the portfolio is
always 4.5 at the end of the life of the option.
Riskless portfolios must, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, earn the risk-free
rate of interest. Suppose that, in this case, the risk-free rate is 12% per annum. It
follows that the value of the portfolio today must be the present value of 4.5, or
4:5e0:123=12 ¼ 4:367
Stock price = $22
Option price = $1
Stock price = $18
Option price = $0
Stock price = $20

297

The value of the stock price today is known to be $20. Suppose the option price is
denoted by f. The value of the portfolio today is
20  0:25  f ¼ 5  f
It follows that
5  f ¼ 4:367
or
f ¼ 0:633
This shows that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the current value of the
option must be 0.633. If the value of the option were more than 0.633, the portfolio
would cost less than 4.367 to set up and would earn more than the risk-free rate. If the
value of the option were less than 0.633, shorting the portfolio would provide a way of
borrowing money at less than the risk-free rate.
Trading 0.25 shares is, of course, not possible. However, the argument is the same if
we imagine selling 400 options and buying 100 shares. In general, it is necessary to buy
 shares for each option sold to form a riskless portfolio. The parameter  (delta) is
important in the hedging of options. It is discussed further later in this chapter and in
Chapter 19.
A Generalization
We can generalize the no-arbitrage argument just presented by considering a stock
whose price is S0 and an option on the stock (or any derivative dependent on the stock)
whose current price is f. We suppose that the option lasts for time T and that during
the life of the option the stock price can either move up from S0 to a new level, S0u,
where u > 1, or down from S0 to a new level, S0d, where d < 1. The percentage increase
in the stock price when there is an up movement is u  1; the percentage decrease when
there is a down movement is 1  d. If the stock price moves up to S0u, we suppose that
the payoﬀfrom the option is fu; if the stock price moves down to S0d, we suppose the
payoﬀfrom the option is fd. The situation is illustrated in Figure 13.2.
As before, we imagine a portfolio consisting of a long position in  shares and a
short position in one option. We calculate the value of  that makes the portfolio
riskless. If there is an up movement in the stock price, the value of the portfolio at the
end of the life of the option is
S0u  fu

If there is a down movement in the stock price, the value becomes
S0d  fd
The two are equal when
S0u  fu ¼ S0d  fd
or
 ¼ fu  fd
S0u  S0d
ð13:1Þ
In this case, the portfolio is riskless and, for there to be no arbitrage opportunities, it
must earn the risk-free interest rate. Equation (13.1) shows that  is the ratio of the
change in the option price to the change in the stock price as we move between the
nodes at time T.
If we denote the risk-free interest rate by r, the present value of the portfolio is
ðS0u  fuÞerT
The cost of setting up the portfolio is
S0  f
It follows that
S0  f ¼ ðS0u  fuÞerT
or
f ¼ S0ð1  uerTÞ þ fuerT
Substituting from equation (13.1) for , we obtain

Equations (13.2) and (13.3) enable an option to be priced when stock price movements
are given by a one-step binomial tree. The only assumption needed for the equation is
that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market.
In the numerical example considered previously (see Figure 13.1), u ¼ 1:1, d ¼ 0:9,
r ¼ 0:12, T ¼ 0:25, fu ¼ 1, and fd ¼ 0. From equation (13.3), we have
p ¼ e0:123=12  0:9

and, from equation (13.2), we have
f ¼ e0:120:25ð0:6523  1 þ 0:3477  0Þ ¼ 0:633
The result agrees with the answer obtained earlier in this section.

Irrelevance of the Stock’s Expected Return
The option pricing formula in equation (13.2) does not involve the probabilities of the
stock price moving up or down. For example, we get the same option price when the
probability of an upward movement is 0.5 as we do when it is 0.9. This is surprising and
seems counterintuitive. It is natural to assume that, as the probability of an upward
movement in the stock price increases, the value of a call option on the stock increases
and the value of a put option on the stock decreases. This is not the case.
The key reason is that we are not valuing the option in absolute terms. We are
calculating its value in terms of the price of the underlying stock. The probabilities of
future up or down movements are already incorporated into the stock price: we do not
need to take them into account again when valuing the option in terms of the stock price.
13.2
RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION
We are now in a position to introduce a very important principle in the pricing of
derivatives known as risk-neutral valuation. This states that, when valuing a derivative,
we can make the assumption that investors are risk-neutral. This assumption means
investors do not increase the expected return they require from an investment to
compensate for increased risk. A world where investors are risk-neutral is referred to
as a risk-neutral world. The world we live in is, of course, not a risk-neutral world. The
higher the risks investors take, the higher the expected returns they require. However, it
turns out that assuming a risk-neutral world gives us the right option price for the
world we live in, as well as for a risk-neutral world. Almost miraculously, it ﬁnesses the
problem that we know hardly anything about the risk aversion of the buyers and sellers
of options.
Risk-neutral valuation seems a surprising result when it is ﬁrst encountered. Options
are risky investments. Should not a person’s risk preferences aﬀect how they are priced?
The answer is that, when we are pricing an option in terms of the price of the
underlying stock, risk preferences are unimportant. As investors become more risk-
averse, stock prices decline, but the formulas relating option prices to stock prices
remain the same.
A risk-neutral world has two features that simplify the pricing of derivatives:
1. The expected return on a stock (or any other investment) is the risk-free rate.
2. The discount rate used for the expected payoﬀon an option (or any other
instrument) is the risk-free rate.
Returning to equation (13.2), the parameter p should be interpreted as the probability
of an up movement in a risk-neutral world, so that 1  p is the probability of a down
movement in this world. We assume u > erT, so that 0 < p < 1. The expression
pfu þ ð1  pÞfd
is the expected future payoﬀfrom the option in a risk-neutral world and equation (13.2)
states that the value of the option today is its expected future payoﬀin a risk-neutral
world discounted at the risk-free rate. This is an application of risk-neutral valuation.
300
CHAPTER 13

To prove the validity of our interpretation of p, we note that, when p is the
probability of an up movement, the expected stock price EðSTÞ at time T is given by
EðSTÞ ¼ pS0u þ ð1  pÞS0d
or
EðSTÞ ¼ pS0ðu  dÞ þ S0d
Substituting from equation (13.3) for p gives
EðSTÞ ¼ S0erT
ð13:4Þ
This shows that the stock price grows, on average, at the risk-free rate when p is the
probability of an up movement. In other words, the stock price behaves exactly as we
would expect it to behave in a risk-neutral world when p is the probability of an up
movement.
Risk-neutral valuation is a very important general result in the pricing of derivatives.
It states that, when we assume the world is risk-neutral, we get the right price for a
derivative in all worlds, not just in a risk-neutral one. We have shown that risk-neutral
valuation is correct when a simple binomial model is assumed for how the price of the
the stock evolves. It can be shown that the result is true regardless of the assumptions
we make about the evolution of the stock price.
To apply risk-neutral valuation to the pricing of a derivative, we ﬁrst calculate what
the probabilities of diﬀerent outcomes would be if the world were risk-neutral. We then
calculate the expected payoﬀfrom the derivative and discount that expected payoﬀat
the risk-free rate of interest.
The One-Step Binomial Example Revisited
We now return to the example in Figure 13.1 and illustrate that risk-neutral valuation
gives the same answer as no-arbitrage arguments. In Figure 13.1, the stock price is
currently $20 and will move either up to $22 or down to $18 at the end of 3 months.
The option considered is a European call option with a strike price of $21 and an
expiration date in 3 months. The risk-free interest rate is 12% per annum.
We deﬁne p as the probability of an upward movement in the stock price in a risk-
neutral world. We can calculate p from equation (13.3). Alternatively, we can argue that
the expected return on the stock in a risk-neutral world must be the risk-free rate
of 12%. This means that p must satisfy
22p þ 18ð1  pÞ ¼ 20e0:123=12
or
4p ¼ 20e0:123=12  18
That is, p must be 0.6523.
At the end of the 3 months, the call option has a 0.6523 probability of being worth 1
and a 0.3477 probability of being worth zero. Its expected value is therefore
0:6523  1 þ 0:3477  0 ¼ 0:6523
In a risk-neutral world this should be discounted at the risk-free rate. The value of the
option today is therefore
0:6523e0:123=12
Binomial Trees
301

or $0.633. This is the same as the value obtained earlier, demonstrating that no-
arbitrage arguments and risk-neutral valuation give the same answer.
Real World vs. Risk-Neutral World
It should be emphasized that p is the probability of an up movement in a risk-neutral
world. In general, this is not the same as the probability of an up movement in the real
world. In our example p ¼ 0:6523. When the probability of an up movement is 0.6523,
the expected return on both the stock and the option is the risk-free rate of 12%.
Suppose that, in the real world, the expected return on the stock is 16% and p is the
probability of an up movement in this world. It follows that
22p þ 18ð1  pÞ ¼ 20e0:163=12
so that p ¼ 0:7041.
The expected payoﬀfrom the option in the real world is then given by
p  1 þ ð1  pÞ  0
or 0.7041. Unfortunately, it is not easy to know the correct discount rate to apply to the
expected payoﬀin the real world. The return the market requires on the stock is 16%
and this is the discount rate that would be used for the expected cash ﬂows from an
investment in the stock. A position in a call option is riskier than a position in the
stock. As a result the discount rate to be applied to the payoﬀfrom a call option is
greater than 16%, but we do not know how much greater than 16% it should be.1
Using risk-neutral valuation solves this problem because we know that in a risk-neutral
world the expected return on all assets (and therefore the discount rate to use for all
expected payoﬀs) is the risk-free rate.
13.3
TWO-STEP BINOMIAL TREES
We can extend the analysis to a two-step binomial tree such as that shown in Figure 13.3.
Here the stock price starts at $20 and in each of two time steps may go up by 10% or
down by 10%. Each time step is 3 months long and the risk-free interest rate is 12% per
annum. We consider a 6-month option with a strike price of $21.
The objective of the analysis is to calculate the option price at the initial node of the
tree. This can be done by repeatedly applying the principles established earlier in the
chapter. Figure 13.4 shows the same tree as Figure 13.3, but with both the stock price
and the option price at each node. (The stock price is the upper number and the option
price is the lower number.) The option prices at the ﬁnal nodes of the tree are easily
calculated. They are the payoﬀs from the option. At node D the stock price is 24.2 and
the option price is 24:2  21 ¼ 3:2; at nodes E and F the option is out of the money and
its value is zero.
At node C the option price is zero, because node C leads to either node E or node F
and at both of those nodes the option price is zero. We calculate the option price at
node B by focusing our attention on the part of the tree shown in Figure 13.5. Using the
1 Since we know the correct value of the option is 0.633, we can deduce that the correct real-world discount
rate is 42.58%. This is because 0:633 ¼ 0:7041e0:42583=12.

notation introduced earlier in the chapter, u ¼ 1:1, d ¼ 0:9, r ¼ 0:12, and T ¼ 0:25, so
that p ¼ 0:6523, and equation (13.2) gives the value of the option at node B as
e0:123=12ð0:6523  3:2 þ 0:3477  0Þ ¼ 2:0257
It remains for us to calculate the option price at the initial node A. We do so by focusing
on the ﬁrst step of the tree. We know that the value of the option at node B is 2.0257 and

that at node C it is zero. Equation (13.2) therefore gives the value at node A as
e0:123=12ð0:6523  2:0257 þ 0:3477  0Þ ¼ 1:2823
The value of the option is $1.2823.
Note that this example was constructed so that u and d (the proportional up and down
movements) were the same at each node of the tree and so that the time steps were of the
same length. As a result, the risk-neutral probability, p, as calculated by equation (13.3)
is the same at each node.
A Generalization
We can generalize the case of two time steps by considering the situation in Figure 13.6.
The stock price is initially S0. During each time step, it either moves up to u times its
initial value or moves down to d times its initial value. The notation for the value of the
option is shown on the tree. (For example, after two up movements the value of the
option is fuu.) We suppose that the risk-free interest rate is r and the length of the time
step is t years.
Because the length of a time step is now t rather than T, equations (13.2) and (13.3)
become
f ¼ ert½pfu þ ð1  pÞfd
ð13:5Þ
p ¼ ert  d

ð13:8Þ
f ¼ ert½pfu þ ð1  pÞfd

f ¼ e2rt½p2fuu þ 2pð1  pÞfud þ ð1  pÞ2fdd
ð13:10Þ

variables p2, 2pð1  pÞ, and ð1  pÞ2 are the probabilities that the upper, middle, and
lower ﬁnal nodes will be reached. The option price is equal to its expected payoﬀin a
risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free interest rate.
As we add more steps to the binomial tree, the risk-neutral valuation principle
continues to hold. The option price is always equal to its expected payoﬀin a risk-
neutral world discounted at the risk-free interest rate.
13.4
A PUT EXAMPLE
The procedures described in this chapter can be used to price puts as well as calls.
Consider a 2-year European put with a strike price of $52 on a stock whose current
price is $50. We suppose that there are two time steps of 1 year, and in each time step
the stock price either moves up by 20% or moves down by 20%. We also suppose that
the risk-free interest rate is 5%.
The tree is shown in Figure 13.7. In this case u ¼ 1:2, d ¼ 0:8 , t ¼ 1, and r ¼ 0:05.
From equation (13.6) the value of the risk-neutral probability, p, is given by
p ¼ e0:051  0:8
1:2  0:8
¼ 0:6282
The possible ﬁnal stock prices are: $72, $48, and $32. In this case, fuu ¼ 0, fud ¼ 4,
and fdd ¼ 20. From equation (13.10),
f ¼ e20:051ð0:62822  0 þ 2  0:6282  0:3718  4 þ 0:37182  20Þ ¼ 4:1923
The value of the put is $4.1923. This result can also be obtained using equation (13.5)

and working back through the tree one step at a time. Figure 13.7 shows the inter-
mediate option prices that are calculated.
13.5
AMERICAN OPTIONS
Up to now all the options we have considered have been European. We now move on to
consider how American options can be valued using a binomial tree such as that in
Figure 13.4 or 13.7. The procedure is to work back through the tree from the end to the
beginning, testing at each node to see whether early exercise is optimal. The value of the
option at the ﬁnal nodes is the same as for the European option. At earlier nodes the
value of the option is the greater of
1. The value given by equation (13.5)
2. The payoﬀfrom early exercise.
Figure 13.8 shows how Figure 13.7 is aﬀected if the option under consideration is
American rather than European. The stock prices and their probabilities are
unchanged. The values for the option at the ﬁnal nodes are also unchanged. At
node B, equation (13.5) gives the value of the option as 1.4147, whereas the payoﬀ
from early exercise is negative (¼ 8). Clearly early exercise is not optimal at node B,
and the value of the option at this node is 1.4147. At node C, equation (13.5) gives the
value of the option as 9.4636, whereas the payoﬀfrom early exercise is 12. In this case,
early exercise is optimal and the value of the option at the node is 12. At the initial node
A, the value given by equation (13.5) is
e0:051ð0:6282  1:4147 þ 0:3718  12:0Þ ¼ 5:0894

and the payoﬀfrom early exercise is 2. In this case early exercise is not optimal. The
value of the option is therefore $5.0894.
13.6
DELTA
At this stage, it is appropriate to introduce delta, an important parameter (sometimes
referred to as a ‘‘Greek letter’’ or simply a ‘‘Greek’’) in the pricing and hedging of
options.
The delta () of a stock option is the ratio of the change in the price of the stock
option to the change in the price of the underlying stock. It is the number of units of the
stock we should hold for each option shorted in order to create a riskless portfolio. It is
the same as the  introduced earlier in this chapter. The construction of a riskless
portfolio is sometimes referred to as delta hedging. The delta of a call option is positive,
whereas the delta of a put option is negative.
From Figure 13.1, we can calculate the value of the delta of the call option being
considered as
1  0
22  18 ¼ 0:25
This is because when the stock price changes from $18 to $22, the option price changes
from $0 to $1. (This is also the value of  calculated in Section 13.1.)
In Figure 13.4 the delta corresponding to stock price movements over the ﬁrst time
step is

or
4  20
48  32 ¼ 1:0000
at the end of the second time step.
The two-step examples show that delta changes over time. (In Figure 13.4, delta
changes from 0.5064 to either 0.7273 or 0; and, in Figure 13.7, it changes from 0:4024 to
either 0:1667 or 1:0000.) Thus, in order to maintain a riskless hedge using an option
and the underlying stock, we need to adjust our holdings in the stock periodically. We
will return to this feature of options in Chapter 19.
13.7
MATCHING VOLATILITY WITH u AND d
The three parameters necessary to construct a binomial tree with time step t are u, d,
and p. Once u and d have been speciﬁed, p must be chosen so that the expected return is
the risk-free rate r. We have already shown that
p ¼ ert  d
u  d
ð13:11Þ
The parameters u and d should be chosen to match volatility. The volatility of stock (or
any other asset), , is deﬁned so that the standard deviation of its return in a short
period of time t is 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
(see Chapter 15 for a further discussion of this). Equivalently
the variance of the return in time t is 2t. The variance of a variable X is deﬁned as
EðX2Þ  ½EðXÞ2, where E denotes expected value. During a time step of length t,
there is a probability p that the stock will provide a return of u  1 and a probability
1  p that it will provide a return of d  1. It follows that volatility is matched if
pðu  1Þ2 þ ð1  pÞðd  1Þ2  ½pðu  1Þ þ ð1  pÞðd  1Þ2 ¼ 2t

These are the values of u and d used by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979).
In the analysis just given we chose u and d to match volatility in the risk-neutral
world. What happens if instead we match volatility in the real world? As we will now
show, the formulas for u and d are the same.
Suppose that p is the probability of an up-movement in the real world while p is
as before the probability of an up-movement in a risk-neutral world. This is illustrated
in Figure 13.9. Deﬁne  as the expected return in the real world. We must have
pu þ ð1  pÞd ¼ et
or
p ¼ et  d
u  d
ð13:14Þ
Suppose that  is the volatility in the real world. The equation matching the variance is
the same as equation (13.12) except that p is replaced by p. When this equation is
combined with equation (13.14), we obtain
etðu þ dÞ  ud  e2t ¼ 2t
This is the same as equation (13.13) except the r is replaced by . When terms in t2
and higher powers of t are ignored, it has the same solution as equation (13.13):

Girsanov’s Theorem
The results we have just produced are closely related to an important result known as
Girsanov’s theorem. When we move from the risk-neutral world to the real world, the
expected return from the stock price changes, but its volatility remains the same. More

generally, when we move from a world with one set of risk preferences to a world with
another set of risk preferences, the expected growth rates in variables change, but their
volatilities remain the same. We will examine the impact of risk preferences on the
behavior of market variables in more detail in Chapter 28. Moving from one set of risk
preferences to another is sometimes referred to as changing the measure. The real-world
measure is sometimes referred to as the P-measure, while the risk-neutral world measure
is referred to as the Q-measure.3

binomial tree is t, we should match volatility by setting

Equations (13.15) to (13.18) deﬁne the tree.
Consider again the American put option in Figure 13.8, where the stock price is $50,
the strike price is $52, the risk-free rate is 5%, the life of the option is 2 years, and there
are two time steps. In this case, t ¼ 1. Suppose that the volatility  is 30%. Then,
from equations (13.15) to (13.18), we have
u ¼ e0:31 ¼ 1:3499;
d ¼

1:3499 ¼ 0:7408;

and
p ¼ 1:053  0:7408
1:3499  0:7408 ¼ 0:5097
The tree is shown in Figure 13.10. The value of the put option is 7.43. (This is
diﬀerent from the value obtained in Figure 13.8 by assuming u ¼ 1:2 and d ¼ 0:8.)
Note that the option is exercised at the end of the ﬁrst time step if the lower node is
reached.
13.9
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STEPS
The binomial model presented above is unrealistically simple. Clearly, an analyst can
expect to obtain only a very rough approximation to an option price by assuming that
3 With the notation we have been using, p is the probability under the Q-measure, while p is the probability
under the P-measure.
310
CHAPTER 13

stock price movements during the life of the option consist of one or two binomial
steps.
When binomial trees are used in practice, the life of the option is typically divided
into 30 or more time steps. In each time step there is a binomial stock price movement.
With 30 time steps there are 31 terminal stock prices and 230, or about 1 billion, possible
stock price paths are implicitly considered.
The equations deﬁning the tree are equations (13.15) to (13.18), regardless of the
number of time steps. Suppose, for example, that there are ﬁve steps instead of two in
the example we considered in Figure 13.10. The parameters would be t ¼ 2=5 ¼ 0:4,
r ¼ 0:05, and  ¼ 0:3. These values give u ¼ e0:3 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:4
p
¼ 1:2089, d ¼ 1=1:2089 ¼ 0:8272,
a ¼ e0:050:4 ¼ 1:0202, and p ¼ ð1:0202  0:8272Þ=ð1:2089  0:8272Þ ¼ 0:5056.
As the number of time steps is increased (so that t becomes smaller), the binomial
tree model makes the same assumptions about stock price behavior as the Black–
Scholes–Merton model, which will be presented in Chapter 15. When the binomial tree
is used to price a European option, the price converges to the Black–Scholes–Merton
price, as expected, as the number of time steps is increased. This is proved in the
appendix to this chapter.

USING DerivaGem
The software accompanying this book, DerivaGem 3.00, is a useful tool for becoming
comfortable with binomial trees. After loading the software in the way described at the
end of this book, go to the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet. Choose
Equity as the Underlying Type and select Binomial American as the Option Type.

steps, as 50, 30%, 5%, 2, 52, and 2, respectively. Click on the Put button and then on
Calculate. The price of the option is shown as 7.428 in the box labeled Price. Now click
on Display Tree and you will see the equivalent of Figure 13.10. (The red numbers in
the software indicate the nodes where the option is exercised.)
Return to the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet and change the number
of time steps to 5. Hit Enter and click on Calculate. You will ﬁnd that the value of the
option changes to 7.671. By clicking on Display Tree the ﬁve-step tree is displayed,
together with the values of u, d, a, and p calculated above.
DerivaGem can display trees that have up to 10 steps, but the calculations can be
done for up to 500 steps. In our example, 500 steps gives the option price (to two
decimal places) as 7.47. This is an accurate answer. By changing the Option Type to
Binomial European, we can use the tree to value a European option. Using 500 time
steps, the value of a European option with the same parameters as the American option
is 6.76. (By changing the Option Type to Black–Scholes European, we can display the
value of the option using the Black–Scholes–Merton formula that will be presented in
Chapter 15. This is also 6.76.)
By changing the Underlying Type, we can consider options on assets other than
stocks. These will now be discussed.
13.11
OPTIONS ON OTHER ASSETS
We introduced options on indices, currencies, and futures contracts in Chapter 10 and
will cover them in more detail in Chapters 17 and 18. It turns out that we can construct
and use binomial trees for these options in exactly the same way as for options on
stocks except that the equations for p change. As in the case of options on stocks,
equation (13.2) applies so that the value at a node (before the possibility of early
exercise is considered) is p times the value if there is an up movement plus 1  p times
the value if there is a down movement, discounted at the risk-free rate.
Options on Stocks Paying a Continuous Dividend Yield
Consider a stock paying a known dividend yield at rate q. The total return from
dividends and capital gains in a risk-neutral world is r. The dividends provide a return
of q. Capital gains must therefore provide a return of r  q. If the stock starts at S0, its
expected value after one time step of length t must be S0eðrqÞt. This means that
pS0u þ ð1  pÞS0d ¼ S0eðrqÞt
so that
p ¼ eðrqÞt  d
u  d
As in the case of options on non-dividend-paying stocks, we match volatility by setting
u ¼ e ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
and d ¼ 1=u. This means that we can use equations (13.15) to (13.18), except
that we set a ¼ eðrqÞt instead of a ¼ ert.
312
CHAPTER 13

Options on Stock Indices
When calculating a futures price for a stock index in Chapter 5 we assumed that the
stocks underlying the index provided a dividend yield at rate q. We make a similar
assumption here. The valuation of an option on a stock index is therefore very similar
to the valuation of an option on a stock paying a known dividend yield.
Example 13.1
A stock index is currently 810 and has a volatility of 20% and a dividend yield of
2%. The risk-free rate is 5%. Figure 13.11 shows the output from DerivaGem for
valuing a European 6-month call option with a strike price of 800 using a two-step
tree. In this case,

Options on Currencies
As pointed out in Section 5.10, a foreign currency can be regarded as an asset providing
a yield at the foreign risk-free rate of interest, rf. By analogy with the stock index case
we can construct a tree for options on a currency by using equations (13.15) to (13.18)
and setting a ¼ eðrrf Þt.
Example 13.2
The Australian dollar is currently worth 0.6100 US dollars and this exchange rate
has a volatility of 12%. The Australian risk-free rate is 7% and the US risk-free rate
is 5%. Figure 13.12 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a 3-month
American call option with a strike price of 0.6000 using a three-step tree. In this

CHAPTER 13

Options on Futures
It costs nothing to take a long or a short position in a futures contract. It follows that in
a risk-neutral world a futures price should have an expected growth rate of zero. (We
discuss this point in more detail in Section 18.7.) As above, we deﬁne p as the
probability of an up movement in the futures price, u as the percentage up movement,
and d as the percentage down movement. If F0 is the initial futures price, the expected
futures price at the end of one time step of length t should also be F0. This means that
pF0u þ ð1  pÞF0d ¼ F0
so that
p ¼ 1  d
u  d
and we can use equations (13.15) to (13.18) with a ¼ 1.
Example 13.3
A futures price is currently 31 and has a volatility of 30%. The risk-free rate is 5%.
Figure 13.13 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a 9-month American
put option with a strike price of 30 using a three-step tree. In this case,

SUMMARY
This chapter has provided a ﬁrst look at the valuation of options on stocks and other
assets using trees. In the simple situation where movements in the price of a stock
during the life of an option are governed by a one-step binomial tree, it is possible to set
up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the stock option and a position in the
stock. In a world with no arbitrage opportunities, riskless portfolios must earn the risk-
free interest. This enables the stock option to be priced in terms of the stock. It is
interesting to note that no assumptions are required about the probabilities of up and
down movements in the stock price at each node of the tree.
When stock price movements are governed by a multistep binomial tree, we can treat
each binomial step separately and work back from the end of the life of the option to
the beginning to obtain the current value of the option. Again only no-arbitrage
arguments are used, and no assumptions are required about the probabilities of up
and down movements in the stock price at each node.
A very important principle states that we can assume the world is risk-neutral when
valuing an option. This chapter has shown, through both numerical examples and
algebra, that no-arbitrage arguments and risk-neutral valuation are equivalent and lead
to the same option prices.
The delta of a stock option, , considers the eﬀect of a small change in the underlying
stock price on the change in the option price. It is the ratio of the change in the option
Binomial Trees
315

price to the change in the stock price. For a riskless position, an investor should buy 
shares for each option sold. An inspection of a typical binomial tree shows that delta
changes during the life of an option. This means that to hedge a particular option
position, we must change our holding in the underlying stock periodically.
Constructing binomial trees for valuing options on stock indices, currencies, and
futures contracts is very similar to doing so for valuing options on stocks. In
Chapter 21, we will return to binomial trees and provide more details on how they
are used in practice.

volatility of the exchange rate is 12% per annum. The domestic and foreign risk-free

APPENDIX
DERIVATION OF THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON
OPTION-PRICING FORMULA FROM A BINOMIAL TREE
One way of deriving the famous Black–Scholes–Merton result for valuing a European
option on a non-dividend-paying stock is by allowing the number of time steps in a
binomial tree to approach inﬁnity.
Suppose that a tree with n time steps is used to value a European call option with
strike price K and life T. Each step is of length T=n. If there have been j upward
movements and n  j downward movements on the tree, the ﬁnal stock price is
S0ujd nj, where u is the proportional up movement, d is the proportional down
movement, and S0 is the initial stock price. The payoﬀfrom a European call option
is then
maxðS0ujd nj  K; 0Þ
From the properties of the binomial distribution, the probability of exactly j upward
and n  j downward movements is given by
n!
ðn  jÞ! j! pjð1  pÞnj
It follows that the expected payoﬀfrom the call option is

ðn  jÞ! j! pjð1  pÞnj maxðS0ujd nj  K; 0Þ
As the tree represents movements in a risk-neutral world, we can discount this at the
risk-free rate r to obtain the option price:

The terms in equation (13A.1) are nonzero when the ﬁnal stock price is greater than the
strike price, that is, when
S0ujd nj > K
or
lnðS0=KÞ > j lnðuÞ  ðn  jÞ lnðdÞ
Since u ¼ e

Consider ﬁrst U2. As is well known, the binomial distribution approaches a normal
distribution as the number of trials approaches inﬁnity. Speciﬁcally, when there are n

successes is approximately normal with mean np and standard deviation

Wiener Processes
and Itoˆ ’s Lemma
Any variable whose value changes over time in an uncertain way is said to follow a
stochastic process. Stochastic processes can be classiﬁed as discrete time or continuous
time. A discrete-time stochastic process is one where the value of the variable can
change only at certain ﬁxed points in time, whereas a continuous-time stochastic
process is one where changes can take place at any time. Stochastic processes can also
be classiﬁed as continuous variable or discrete variable. In a continuous-variable process,
the underlying variable can take any value within a certain range, whereas in a discrete-
variable process, only certain discrete values are possible.
This chapter develops a continuous-variable, continuous-time stochastic process for
stock prices. Learning about this process is the ﬁrst step to understanding the pricing
of options and other more complicated derivatives. It should be noted that, in
practice, we do not observe stock prices following continuous-variable, continuous-
time processes. Stock prices are restricted to discrete values (e.g., multiples of a cent)
and changes can be observed only when the exchange is open for trading. Never-
theless, the continuous-variable, continuous-time process proves to be a useful model
for many purposes.
Many people feel that continuous-time stochastic processes are so complicated that
they should be left entirely to ‘‘rocket scientists.’’ This is not so. The biggest hurdle to
understanding these processes is the notation. Here we present a step-by-step approach
aimed at getting the reader over this hurdle. We also explain an important result known
as Itoˆ’s lemma that is central to the pricing of derivatives.
14.1
THE MARKOV PROPERTY
A Markov process is a particular type of stochastic process where only the current value
of a variable is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and
the way that the present has emerged from the past are irrelevant.
Stock prices are usually assumed to follow a Markov process. Suppose that the
price of a stock is $100 now. If the stock price follows a Markov process, our
predictions for the future should be unaﬀected by the price one week ago, one month
324
14
C H A P T E R

ago, or one year ago. The only relevant piece of information is that the price is now
$100.1 Predictions for the future are uncertain and must be expressed in terms of
probability distributions. The Markov property implies that the probability distribu-
tion of the price at any particular future time is not dependent on the particular path
followed by the price in the past.
The Markov property of stock prices is consistent with the weak form of market
eﬃciency. This states that the present price of a stock impounds all the information
contained in a record of past prices. If the weak form of market eﬃciency were not true,
technical analysts could make above-average returns by interpreting charts of the past
history of stock prices. There is very little evidence that they are in fact able to do this.
It is competition in the marketplace that tends to ensure that weak-form market
eﬃciency and the Markov property hold. There are many investors watching the stock
market closely. This leads to a situation where a stock price, at any given time, reﬂects the
information in past prices. Suppose that it was discovered that a particular pattern in a
stock price always gave a 65% chance of subsequent steep price rises. Investors would
attempt to buy a stock as soon as the pattern was observed, and demand for the stock
would immediately rise. This would lead to an immediate rise in its price and the
observed eﬀect would be eliminated, as would any proﬁtable trading opportunities.
14.2
CONTINUOUS-TIME STOCHASTIC PROCESSES
Consider a variable that follows a Markov stochastic process. Suppose that its current
value is 10 and that the change in its value during a year is ð0; 1Þ, where ðm; vÞ
denotes a probability distribution that is normally distributed with mean m and
variance v.2 What is the probability distribution of the change in the value of the
variable during 2 years?
The change in 2 years is the sum of two normal distributions, each of which has a
mean of zero and variance of 1.0. Because the variable is Markov, the two probability
distributions are independent. When we add two independent normal distributions, the
result is a normal distribution where the mean is the sum of the means and the variance
is the sum of the variances. The mean of the change during 2 years in the variable we
are considering is, therefore, zero and the variance of this change is 2.0. Hence, the
change in the variable over 2 years has the distribution ð0; 2Þ. The standard deviation
of the change is
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
.
Consider next the change in the variable during 6 months. The variance of the
change in the value of the variable during 1 year equals the variance of the change
during the ﬁrst 6 months plus the variance of the change during the second 6 months.
We assume these are the same. It follows that the variance of the change during a
6-month period must be 0.5. Equivalently, the standard deviation of the change is
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:5
p
.
The probability distribution for the change in the value of the variable during 6 months
is ð0; 0:5Þ.
1 Statistical properties of the stock price history may be useful in determining the characteristics of the
stochastic process followed by the stock price (e.g., its volatility). The point being made here is that the
particular path followed by the stock in the past is irrelevant.
2 Variance is the square of standard deviation. The standard deviation of a 1-year change in the value of the
variable we are considering is therefore 1.0.
Wiener Processes and Itoˆ ’s Lemma
325

A similar argument shows that the probability distribution for the change in the
value of the variable during 3 months is ð0; 0:25Þ. More generally, the change during
any time period of length T is ð0; TÞ. In particular, the change during a very short time
period of length t is ð0; tÞ.
Note that, when Markov processes are considered, the variances of the changes in
successive time periods are additive. The standard deviations of the changes in
successive time periods are not additive. The variance of the change in the variable
in our example is 1.0 per year, so that the variance of the change in 2 years is 2.0 and
the variance of the change in 3 years is 3.0. The standard deviations of the changes in
2 and 3 years are
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
and
ﬃﬃﬃ
3
p
, respectively. (Strictly speaking, we should not refer to the
standard deviation of the variable as 1.0 per year.) The results explain why uncertainty
is sometimes referred to as being proportional to the square root of time.
Wiener Process
The process followed by the variable we have been considering is known as a Wiener
process. It is a particular type of Markov stochastic process with a mean change of zero
and a variance rate of 1.0 per year. It has been used in physics to describe the motion of
a particle that is subject to a large number of small molecular shocks and is sometimes
referred to as Brownian motion.
Expressed formally, a variable z follows a Wiener process if it has the following two
properties:
Property 1. The change z during a small period of time t is
z ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
ð14:1Þ
where  has a standard normal distribution ð0; 1Þ.
Property 2. The values of z for any two diﬀerent short intervals of time, t, are
independent.
It follows from the ﬁrst property that z itself has a normal distribution with
mean of z ¼ 0
standard deviation of z ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
variance of z ¼ t
The second property implies that z follows a Markov process.
Consider the change in the value of z during a relatively long period of time, T. This
can be denoted by zðTÞ  zð0Þ. It can be regarded as the sum of the changes in z in
N small time intervals of length t, where
N ¼ T
t
Thus,
zðTÞ  zð0Þ ¼
X
N
i¼1
i
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
ð14:2Þ
where the i (i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; N) are distributed ð0; 1Þ. We know from the second
property of Wiener processes that the i are independent of each other. It follows
326
CHAPTER 14

from equation (14.2) that zðTÞ  zð0Þ is normally distributed, with
mean of ½zðTÞ  zð0Þ ¼ 0
variance of½zðTÞ  zð0Þ ¼ N t ¼ T
standard deviation of ½zðTÞ  zð0Þ ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

p
This is consistent with the discussion earlier in this section.
Example 14.1
Suppose that the value, z, of a variable that follows a Wiener process is initially 25
and that time is measured in years. At the end of 1 year, the value of the variable
is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 1.0. At the
end of 5 years, it is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard
deviation of
ﬃﬃﬃ
5
p
, or 2.236. Our uncertainty about the value of the variable at a
certain time in the future, as measured by its standard deviation, increases as the
square root of how far we are looking ahead.
In ordinary calculus, it is usual to proceed from small changes to the limit as the small
changes become closer to zero. Thus, dx ¼ a dt is the notation used to indicate that
x ¼ a t in the limit as t ! 0. We use similar notational conventions in stochastic
calculus. So, when we refer to dz as a Wiener process, we mean that it has the properties
for z given above in the limit as t ! 0.
Figure 14.1 illustrates what happens to the path followed by z as the limit t ! 0 is
approached. Note that the path is quite ‘‘jagged.’’ This is because the standard
deviation of the movement in z in time t equals
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
and, when t is small,
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
is
much bigger than t. Two intriguing properties of Wiener processes, related to this
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
property, are as follows:
1. The expected length of the path followed by z in any time interval is inﬁnite.
2. The expected number of times z equals any particular value in any time interval is
inﬁnite.3
Generalized Wiener Process
The mean change per unit time for a stochastic process is known as the drift rate and
the variance per unit time is known as the variance rate. The basic Wiener process, dz,
that has been developed so far has a drift rate of zero and a variance rate of 1.0. The
drift rate of zero means that the expected value of z at any future time is equal to its
current value. The variance rate of 1.0 means that the variance of the change in z in a
time interval of length T equals T. A generalized Wiener process for a variable x can be
deﬁned in terms of dz as
dx ¼ a dt þ b dz
ð14:3Þ
where a and b are constants.
To understand equation (14.3), it is useful to consider the two components on the
right-hand side separately. The a dt term implies that x has an expected drift rate of
a per unit of time. Without the b dz term, the equation is dx ¼ a dt, which implies that
3 This is because z has some nonzero probability of equaling any value v in the time interval. If it equals v in
time t, the expected number of times it equals v in the immediate vicinity of t is inﬁnite.

CHAPTER 14

dx=dt ¼ a. Integrating with respect to time, we get
x ¼ x0 þ at
where x0 is the value of x at time 0. In a period of time of length T, the variable x
increases by an amount aT. The b dz term on the right-hand side of equation (14.3) can
be regarded as adding noise or variability to the path followed by x. The amount of this
noise or variability is b times a Wiener process. A Wiener process has a variance rate per
unit time of 1.0. It follows that b times a Wiener process has a variance rate per unit
time of b2. In a small time interval t, the change x in the value of x is given by
equations (14.1) and (14.3) as
x ¼ a t þ b
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
where, as before,  has a standard normal distribution ð0; 1Þ. Thus x has a normal
distribution with
mean of x ¼ a t
standard deviation of x ¼ b
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
variance of x ¼ b2t
Similar arguments to those given for a Wiener process show that the change in the value
of x in any time interval T is normally distributed with
mean of change in x ¼ aT
standard deviation of change in x ¼ b
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
variance of change in x ¼ b2T
To summarize, the generalized Wiener process given in equation (14.3) has an expected
drift rate (i.e., average drift per unit of time) of a and a variance rate (i.e., variance per
unit of time) of b2. It is illustrated in Figure 14.2.

329

Example 14.2
Consider the situation where the cash position of a company, measured in thou-
sands of dollars, follows a generalized Wiener process with a drift of 20 per year
and a variance rate of 900 per year. Initially, the cash position is 50. At the end of
1 year the cash position will have a normal distribution with a mean of 70 and a
standard deviation of
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
900
p
, or 30. At the end of 6 months it will have a normal
distribution with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 30
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:5
p
¼ 21:21. Our
uncertainty about the cash position at some time in the future, as measured by its
standard deviation, increases as the square root of how far ahead we are looking.
(Note that the cash position can become negative. We can interpret this as a
situation where the company is borrowing funds.)
Itoˆ Process
A further type of stochastic process, known as an Itoˆ process, can be deﬁned. This is a
generalized Wiener process in which the parameters a and b are functions of the value of
the underlying variable x and time t. An Itoˆ process can therefore be written as
dx ¼ aðx; tÞ dt þ bðx; tÞ dz
ð14:4Þ
Both the expected drift rate and variance rate of an Itoˆ process are liable to change over
time. In a small time interval between t and t þ t, the variable changes from x to
x þ x, where
x ¼ aðx; tÞt þ bðx; tÞ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
This equation involves a small approximation. It assumes that the drift and variance rate
of x remain constant, equal to their values at time t, during the time interval between t
and t þ t.
Note that the process in equation (14.4) is Markov because the change in x at time t
depends only on the value of x at time t, not on its history. A non-Markov process could
be deﬁned by letting a and b in equation (14.4) depend on values of x prior to time t.
14.3
THE PROCESS FOR A STOCK PRICE
In this section we discuss the stochastic process usually assumed for the price of a non-
dividend-paying stock.
It is tempting to suggest that a stock price follows a generalized Wiener process; that is,
that it has a constant expected drift rate and a constant variance rate. However, this
model fails to capture a key aspect of stock prices. This is that the expected percentage
return required by investors from a stock is independent of the stock’s price. If investors
require a 14% per annum expected return when the stock price is $10, then, ceteris
paribus, they will also require a 14% per annum expected return when it is $50.
Clearly, the assumption of constant expected drift rate is inappropriate and needs to
be replaced by the assumption that the expected return (i.e., expected drift divided by
the stock price) is constant. If S is the stock price at time t, then the expected drift rate
in S should be assumed to be S for some constant parameter . This means that in a
short interval of time, t, the expected increase in S is S t. The parameter  is the
expected rate of return on the stock.
330
CHAPTER 14

If the coeﬃcient of dz is zero, so that there is no uncertainty, then this model implies
that
S ¼ S t
In the limit, as t ! 0,
dS ¼ S dt
or
dS
S ¼  dt
Integrating between time 0 and time T, we get
ST ¼ S0eT
ð14:5Þ
where S0 and ST are the stock price at time 0 and time T. Equation (14.5) shows that,
when there is no uncertainty, the stock price grows at a continuously compounded rate
of  per unit of time.
In practice, of course, there is uncertainty. A reasonable assumption is that the
variability of the return in a short period of time, t, is the same regardless of the
stock price. In other words, an investor is just as uncertain of the return when the stock
price is $50 as when it is $10. This suggests that the standard deviation of the change in
a short period of time t should be proportional to the stock price and leads to the
model
dS ¼ S dt þ S dz
or
dS
S ¼  dt þ  dz
ð14:6Þ
Equation (14.6) is the most widely used model of stock price behavior. The variable  is
the stock’s expected rate of return. The variable  is the volatility of the stock price. The
variable 2 is referred to as its variance rate. The model in equation (14.6) represents
the stock price process in the real world. In a risk-neutral world,  equals the risk-free
rate r.
Discrete-Time Model
The model of stock price behavior we have developed is known as geometric Brownian
motion. The discrete-time version of the model is
S
S ¼  t þ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
ð14:7Þ
or
S ¼ S t þ S
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
ð14:8Þ
The variable S is the change in the stock price S in a small time interval t, and as
before  has a standard normal distribution (i.e., a normal distribution with a mean of
zero and standard deviation of 1.0). The parameter  is the expected rate of return per
unit of time from the stock. The parameter  is the volatility of the stock price. In this
chapter we will assume these parameters are constant.
The left-hand side of equation (14.7) is the discrete approximation to the return
provided by the stock in a short period of time, t. The term  t is the expected value
of this return, and the term 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
is the stochastic component of the return. The
Wiener Processes and Itoˆ ’s Lemma
331

variance of the stochastic component (and, therefore, of the whole return) is 2t. This
is consistent with the deﬁnition of the volatility  given in Section 13.7; that is,  is such
that 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
is the standard deviation of the return in a short time period t.
Equation (14.7) shows that S=S is approximately normally distributed with mean
 t and standard deviation 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
. In other words,
S
S  ð t; 2tÞ
ð14:9Þ
Example 14.3
Consider a stock that pays no dividends, has a volatility of 30% per annum, and
provides an expected return of 15% per annum with continuous compounding. In
this case,  ¼ 0:15 and  ¼ 0:30. The process for the stock price is
dS
S ¼ 0:15 dt þ 0:30 dz
If S is the stock price at a particular time and S is the increase in the stock price
in the next small interval of time, the discrete approximation to the process is
S
S ¼ 0:15t þ 0:30
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
where  has a standard normal distribution. Consider a time interval of 1 week,
or 0.0192 year, so that t ¼ 0:0192. Then the approximation gives
S
S ¼ 0:15  0:0192 þ 0:30 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:0192
p

or
S ¼ 0:00288S þ 0:0416S
Monte Carlo Simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation of a stochastic process is a procedure for sampling random
outcomes for the process. We will use it as a way of developing some understanding of
the nature of the stock price process in equation (14.6).
Consider the situation in Example 14.3 where the expected return from a stock is
15% per annum and the volatility is 30% per annum. The stock price change over
1 week was shown to be approximately
S ¼ 0:00288S þ 0:0416S
ð14:10Þ
A path for the stock price over 10 weeks can be simulated by sampling repeatedly for 
from ð0; 1Þ and substituting into equation (14.10). The expression ¼RANDð Þ in Excel
produces a random sample between 0 and 1. The inverse cumulative normal distribution
is NORMSINV. The instruction to produce a random sample from a standard normal
distribution in Excel is therefore ¼NORMSINVðRANDð ÞÞ. Table 14.1 shows one path
for a stock price that was sampled in this way. The initial stock price is assumed to be
$100. For the ﬁrst period,  is sampled as 0.52. From equation (14.10), the change during
the ﬁrst time period is
S ¼ 0:00288  100 þ 0:0416  100  0:52 ¼ 2:45
Therefore, at the beginning of the second time period, the stock price is $102.45. The
332
CHAPTER 14

value of  sampled for the next period is 1.44. From equation (14.10), the change during
the second time period is
S ¼ 0:00288  102:45 þ 0:0416  102:45  1:44 ¼ 6:43
So, at the beginning of the next period, the stock price is $108.88, and so on.4 Note
that, because the process we are simulating is Markov, the samples for  should be
independent of each other.
Table 14.1 assumes that stock prices are measured to the nearest cent. It is important
to realize that the table shows only one possible pattern of stock price movements.
Diﬀerent random samples would lead to diﬀerent price movements. Any small time
interval t can be used in the simulation. In the limit as t ! 0, a perfect description
of the stochastic process is obtained. The ﬁnal stock price of 111.54 in Table 14.1 can be
regarded as a random sample from the distribution of stock prices at the end of
10 weeks. By repeatedly simulating movements in the stock price, a complete prob-
ability distribution of the stock price at the end of this time is obtained. Monte Carlo
simulation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 21.
14.4
THE PARAMETERS
The process for a stock price developed in this chapter involves two parameters,  and .
The parameter  is the expected return (annualized) earned by an investor in a short
period of time. Most investors require higher expected returns to induce them to take
higher risks. It follows that the value of  should depend on the risk of the return from
the stock.5 It should also depend on the level of interest rates in the economy. The higher
the level of interest rates, the higher the expected return required on any given stock.

4 In practice, it is more eﬃcient to sample ln S rather than S, as will be discussed in Section 21.6.
5 More precisely,  depends on that part of the risk that cannot be diversiﬁed away by the investor.
Wiener Processes and Itoˆ ’s Lemma
333

Fortunately, we do not have to concern ourselves with the determinants of  in any
detail because the value of a derivative dependent on a stock is, in general, independent
of . The parameter , the stock price volatility, is, by contrast, critically important to
the determination of the value of many derivatives. We will discuss procedures for
estimating  in Chapter 15. Typical values of  for a stock are in the range 0.15 to 0.60
(i.e., 15% to 60%).
The standard deviation of the proportional change in the stock price in a small
interval of time t is 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
. As a rough approximation, the standard deviation of the
proportional change in the stock price over a relatively long period of time T is 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
.
This means that, as an approximation, volatility can be interpreted as the standard
deviation of the change in the stock price in 1 year. In Chapter 15, we will show that the
volatility of a stock price is exactly equal to the standard deviation of the continuously
compounded return provided by the stock in 1 year.
14.5
CORRELATED PROCESSES
So far we have considered how the stochastic process for a single variable can be
represented. We now extend the analysis to the situation where there are two or more
variables following correlated stochastic processes. Suppose that the processes followed
by two variables x1 and x2 are
dx1 ¼ a1 dt þ b1 dz1
and
dx2 ¼ a2 dt þ b2 dz2
where dz1 and dz2 are Wiener processes.
As has been explained, the discrete-time approximations for these processes are
x1 ¼ a1 t þ b1 1
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
and
x2 ¼ a2 t þ b2 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
where 1 and 2 are samples from a standard normal distribution ð0; 1Þ.
The variables x1 and x2 can be simulated in the way described in Section 14.3. If they
are uncorrelated with each other, the random samples 1 and 2 that are used to obtain
movements in a particular period of time t should be independent of each other.
If x1 and x2 have a nonzero correlation , then the 1 and 2 that are used to obtain
movements in a particular period of time should be sampled from a bivariate normal
distribution. Each variable in the bivariate normal distribution has a standard normal
distribution and the correlation between the variables is . In this situation, we would
refer to the Wiener processes dz1 and dz2 as having a correlation .
Obtaining samples for uncorrelated standard normal variables in cells in Excel
involves putting the instruction ‘‘=NORMSINV(RAND))’’ in each of the cells. To
sample standard normal variables 1 and 2 with correlation , we can set
1 ¼ u
and
2 ¼ u þ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1  2
p
v
where u and v are sampled as uncorrelated variables with standard normal distributions.
Note that, in the processes we have assumed for x1 and x2, the parameters a1, a2, b1,
and b2 can be functions of x1, x2, and t. In particular, a1 and b1 can be functions of x2
as well as x1 and t; and a2 and b2 can be functions of x1 as well as x2 and t.
334
CHAPTER 14

The results here can be generalized. When there are three diﬀerent variables following
correlated stochastic processes, we have to sample three diﬀerent ’s. These have a
trivariate normal distribution. When there are n correlated variables, we have n diﬀerent
’s and these must be sampled from an appropriate multivariate normal distribution.
The way this is done is explained in Chapter 21.
14.6
ITOˆ ’S LEMMA
The price of a stock option is a function of the underlying stock’s price and time. More
generally, we can say that the price of any derivative is a function of the stochastic
variables underlying the derivative and time. A serious student of derivatives must,
therefore, acquire some understanding of the behavior of functions of stochastic
variables. An important result in this area was discovered by the mathematician
K. Itoˆ in 1951,6 and is known as Itoˆ’s lemma.
Suppose that the value of a variable x follows the Itoˆ process
dx ¼ aðx; tÞ dt þ bðx; tÞ dz
ð14:11Þ
where dz is a Wiener process and a and b are functions of x and t. The variable x has a
drift rate of a and a variance rate of b2. Itoˆ ’s lemma shows that a function G of x and t
follows the process
dG ¼
@G
@x a þ @G
@t þ 1
2
@2G
@x2 b2

dt þ @G
@x b dz
ð14:12Þ
where the dz is the same Wiener process as in equation (14.11). Thus, G also follows an
Itoˆ process, with a drift rate of
@G
@x a þ @G
@t þ 1
2
@2G
@x2 b2
and a variance rate of
@G
@x
2
b2
A completely rigorous proof of Itoˆ ’s lemma is beyond the scope of this book. In the
appendix to this chapter, we show that the lemma can be viewed as an extension of well-
known results in diﬀerential calculus.
Earlier, we argued that
dS ¼ S dt þ S dz
ð14:13Þ
with  and  constant, is a reasonable model of stock price movements. From Itoˆ ’s
lemma, it follows that the process followed by a function G of S and t is
dG ¼
@G
@S S þ @G
@t þ 1
2
@2G
@S2 2S 2

dt þ @G
@S S dz
ð14:14Þ
Note that both S and G are aﬀected by the same underlying source of uncertainty, dz.
This proves to be very important in the derivation of the Black–Scholes–Merton results.

Wiener Processes and Itoˆ ’s Lemma
335

Application to Forward Contracts
To illustrate Itoˆ ’s lemma, consider a forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock.
Assume that the risk-free rate of interest is constant and equal to r for all maturities.
From equation (5.1),
F0 ¼ S0erT
where F0 is the forward price at time zero, S0 is the spot price at time zero, and T is the
time to maturity of the forward contract.
We are interested in what happens to the forward price as time passes. We deﬁne F as
the forward price at a general time t, and S as the stock price at time t, with t < T. The
relationship between F and S is given by
F ¼ SerðTtÞ
ð14:15Þ
Assuming that the process for S is given by equation (14.13), we can use Itoˆ ’s lemma to
determine the process for F. From equation (14.15),
@F
@S ¼ erðTtÞ;
@2F
@S 2 ¼ 0;
@F
@t ¼ rSerðTtÞ
From equation (14.14), the process for F is given by
dF ¼

erðTtÞS  rSerðTtÞ
dt þ erðTtÞS dz
Substituting F for SerðTtÞ gives
dF ¼ ð  rÞF dt þ F dz
ð14:16Þ
Like S, the forward price F follows geometric Brownian motion. It has an expected
growth rate of   r rather than . The growth rate in F is the excess return of S over
the risk-free rate.
14.7
THE LOGNORMAL PROPERTY
We now use Itoˆ ’s lemma to derive the process followed by ln S when S follows the process
in equation (14.13). We deﬁne
G ¼ ln S
Since
@G
@S ¼ 1
S ;
@2G
@S 2 ¼  1
S 2 ;
@G
@t ¼ 0
it follows from equation (14.14) that the process followed by G is
dG ¼

  2
2

dt þ  dz
ð14:17Þ
Since  and  are constant, this equation indicates that G ¼ ln S follows a generalized
Wiener process. It has constant drift rate   2=2 and constant variance rate 2. The
336
CHAPTER 14

change in ln S between time 0 and some future time T is therefore normally distributed,
with mean ð  2=2ÞT and variance 2T. This means that
ln ST  ln S0  


or
ln ST  


ð14:19Þ
where ST is the stock price at time T, S0 is the stock price at time 0, and as before ðm; vÞ
denotes a normal distribution with mean m and variance v.
Equation (14.19) shows that ln ST is normally distributed. A variable has a lognormal
distribution if the natural logarithm of the variable is normally distributed. The model
of stock price behavior we have developed in this chapter therefore implies that a stock’s
price at time T, given its price today, is lognormally distributed. The standard deviation
of the logarithm of the stock price is 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
. It is proportional to the square root of how
far ahead we are looking.
SUMMARY
Stochastic processes describe the probabilistic evolution of the value of a variable
through time. A Markov process is one where only the present value of the variable
is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and the way in
which the present has emerged from the past is irrelevant.
A Wiener process dz is a Markov process describing the evolution of a normally
distributed variable. The drift of the process is zero and the variance rate is 1.0 per unit
time. This means that, if the value of the variable is x0 at time 0, then at time T it is
normally distributed with mean x0 and standard deviation
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
.
A generalized Wiener process describes the evolution of a normally distributed
variable with a drift of a per unit time and a variance rate of b2 per unit time, where
a and b are constants. This means that if, as before, the value of the variable is x0 at
time 0, it is normally distributed with a mean of x0 þ aT and a standard deviation of
b
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
at time T.
An Itoˆ process is a process where the drift and variance rate of x can be a function of
both x itself and time. The change in x in a very short period of time is, to a good
approximation, normally distributed, but its change over longer periods of time is liable
to be nonnormal.
One way of gaining an intuitive understanding of a stochastic process for a variable is
to simulate the behavior of the variable. This involves dividing a time interval into
many small time steps and randomly sampling possible paths for the variable. The
future probability distribution for the variable can then be calculated. Monte Carlo
simulation is discussed further in Chapter 21.
Itoˆ ’s lemma is a way of calculating the stochastic process followed by a function of a
variable from the stochastic process followed by the variable itself. As we shall see in
Chapter 15, Itoˆ ’s lemma plays a very important part in the pricing of derivatives. A key
point is that the Wiener process dz underlying the stochastic process for the variable is
exactly the same as the Wiener process underlying the stochastic process for the function
of the variable. Both are subject to the same underlying source of uncertainty.
Wiener Processes and Itoˆ ’s Lemma
337

The stochastic process usually assumed for a stock price is geometric Brownian
motion. Under this process the return to the holder of the stock in a small period of
time is normally distributed and the returns in two nonoverlapping periods are
independent. The value of the stock price at a future time has a lognormal distribution.
The Black–Scholes–Merton model, which we cover in the next chapter, is based on the
geometric Brownian motion assumption.

APPENDIX
DERIVATION OF ITOˆ ’S LEMMA
In this appendix, we show how Itoˆ ’s lemma can be regarded as a natural extension of
other, simpler results. Consider a continuous and diﬀerentiable function G of a
variable x. If x is a small change in x and G is the resulting small change in G, a
well-known result from ordinary calculus is
G  dG
dx x
ð14A:1Þ
In other words, G is approximately equal to the rate of change of G with respect to x
multiplied by x. The error involves terms of order x2. If more precision is required, a
Taylor series expansion of G can be used:
G ¼ dG

analogous to equation (14A.1) is
G  @G
@x x þ @G

ð14A:2Þ

This equation reveals an important diﬀerence between the situation in equation (14A.6)
and the situation in equation (14A.3). When limiting arguments were used to move
from equation (14A.3) to equation (14A.4), terms in x2 were ignored because they
were second-order terms. From equation (14A.7), we have
x2 ¼ b22t þ terms of higher order in t
ð14A:8Þ
This shows that the term involving x2 in equation (14A.6) has a component that is of
order t and cannot be ignored.
The variance of a standard normal distribution is 1.0. This means that
Eð2Þ  ½EðÞ2 ¼ 1
where E denotes expected value. Since EðÞ ¼ 0, it follows that Eð2Þ ¼ 1. The expected
value of 2t, therefore, is t. The variance of 2t is, from the properties of the
standard normal distribution, 2t2. We know that the variance of the change in a
stochastic variable in time t is proportional to t, not t2. The variance of 2t is
therefore too small for it to have a stochastic component. As a result, we can treat 2t
as nonstochastic and equal to its expected value, t, as t tends to zero. It follows from
equation (14A.8) that x2 becomes nonstochastic and equal to b2dt as t tends to zero.
Taking limits as x and t tend to zero in equation (14A.6), and using this last result,

CHAPTER 14

The Black–
Scholes–Merton
Model
In the early 1970s, Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton achieved a major
breakthrough in the pricing of European stock options.1 This was the development of
what has become known as the Black–Scholes–Merton (or Black–Scholes) model. The
model has had a huge inﬂuence on the way that traders price and hedge derivatives. In
1997, the importance of the model was recognized when Robert Merton and Myron
Scholes were awarded the Nobel prize for economics. Sadly, Fischer Black died in 1995;
otherwise he too would undoubtedly have been one of the recipients of this prize.
How did Black, Scholes, and Merton make their breakthrough? Previous researchers
had made the similar assumptions and had correctly calculated the expected payoﬀfrom
a European option. However, as explained in Section 13.2, it is diﬃcult to know the
correct discount rate to use for this payoﬀ. Black and Scholes used the capital asset
pricing model (see the appendix to Chapter 3) to determine a relationship between the
market’s required return on the option and the required return on the stock. This was
not easy because the relationship depends on both the stock price and time. Merton’s
approach was diﬀerent from that of Black and Scholes. It involved setting up a riskless
portfolio consisting of the option and the underlying stock and arguing that the return
on the portfolio over a short period of time must be the risk-free return. This is similar
to what we did in Section 13.1—but more complicated because the portfolio changes
continuously through time. Merton’s approach was more general than that of Black and
Scholes because it did not rely on the assumptions of the capital asset pricing model.
This chapter covers Merton’s approach to deriving the Black–Scholes–Merton
model. It explains how volatility can be either estimated from historical data or implied
from option prices using the model. It shows how the risk-neutral valuation argument
introduced in Chapter 13 can be used. It also shows how the Black–Scholes–Merton
model can be extended to deal with European call and put options on dividend-paying
stocks and presents some results on the pricing of American call options on dividend-
paying stocks.

15.1
LOGNORMAL PROPERTY OF STOCK PRICES
The model of stock price behavior used by Black, Scholes, and Merton is the model we
developed in Chapter 14. It assumes that percentage changes in the stock price in a very
short period of time are normally distributed. Deﬁne
: Expected return on stock per year
: Volatility of the stock price per year.
The mean and standard deviation of the return in time t are approximately  t and

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
, so that
S
S  ð t; 2tÞ
ð15:1Þ
where S is the change in the stock price S in time t, and ðm; vÞ denotes a normal
distribution with mean m and variance v. (This is equation (14.9).)
As shown in Section 14.7, the model implies that
ln ST  ln S0  

  2

so that

ð15:3Þ
where ST is the stock price at a future time T and S0 is the stock price at time 0. There is
no approximation here. The variable ln ST is normally distributed, so that ST has a
lognormal distribution. The mean of ln ST is ln S0 þ ð  2=2ÞT and the standard
deviation of ln ST is 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
.
Example 15.1
Consider a stock with an initial price of $40, an expected return of 16% per
annum, and a volatility of 20% per annum. From equation (15.3), the probability
distribution of the stock price ST in 6 months’ time is given by
ln ST  ½ln 40 þ ð0:16  0:22=2Þ  0:5; 0:22  0:5
ln ST  ð3:759; 0:02Þ
There is a 95% probability that a normally distributed variable has a value within
1.96 standard deviations of its mean. In this case, the standard deviation is
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:02
p
¼ 0:141. Hence, with 95% conﬁdence,
3:759  1:96  0:141 < ln ST < 3:759 þ 1:96  0:141
This can be written
e3:7591:960:141 < ST < e3:759þ1:960:141
or
32:55 < ST < 56:56
Thus, there is a 95% probability that the stock price in 6 months will lie between
32.55 and 56.56.
344
CHAPTER 15

A variable that has a lognormal distribution can take any value between zero and
inﬁnity. Figure 15.1 illustrates the shape of a lognormal distribution. Unlike the normal
distribution, it is skewed so that the mean, median, and mode are all diﬀerent. From
equation (15.3) and the properties of the lognormal distribution, it can be shown that
the expected value EðSTÞ of ST is given by
EðSTÞ ¼ S0eT
ð15:4Þ
This ﬁts in with the deﬁnition of  as the expected rate of return. The variance varðSTÞ
of ST, can be shown to be given by2
varðSTÞ ¼ S 2

ð15:5Þ
Example 15.2
Consider a stock where the current price is $20, the expected return is 20% per
annum, and the volatility is 40% per annum. The expected stock price, EðSTÞ, and
the variance of the stock price, varðST Þ, in 1 year are given by
EðSTÞ ¼ 20e0:21 ¼ 24:43
and
varðSTÞ ¼ 400e20:21ðe0:421  1Þ ¼ 103:54

15.2
THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATE OF RETURN
The lognormal property of stock prices can be used to provide information on the
probability distribution of the continuously compounded rate of return earned on a
stock between times 0 and T. If we deﬁne the continuously compounded rate of return

From equation (15.2), it follows that
x  

ð15:7Þ
Thus, the continuously compounded rate of return per annum is normally distributed
with mean   2=2 and standard deviation =

T

. As T increases, the standard
deviation of x declines. To understand the reason for this, consider two cases: T ¼ 1
and T ¼ 20. We are more certain about the average return per year over 20 years than
we are about the return in any one year.
Example 15.3
Consider a stock with an expected return of 17% per annum and a volatility of
20% per annum. The probability distribution for the average rate of return (con-
tinuously compounded) realized over 3 years is normal, with mean
0:17  0:22

or 15% per annum, and standard deviation
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:22

s
¼ 0:1155
or 11.55% per annum. Because there is a 95% chance that a normally distrib-
uted variable will lie within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean, we can be
95% conﬁdent that the average return realized over 3 years will be between
15  1:96  11:55 ¼ 7:6% and 15 þ 1:96  11:55 ¼ þ37:6% per annum.
15.3
THE EXPECTED RETURN
The expected return, , required by investors from a stock depends on the riskiness of
the stock. The higher the risk, the higher the expected return. It also depends on the
level of interest rates in the economy. The higher the level of interest rates, the higher
the expected return required on any given stock. Fortunately, we do not have to concern
ourselves with the determinants of  in any detail. It turns out that the value of a stock
option, when expressed in terms of the value of the underlying stock, does not depend
on  at all. Nevertheless, there is one aspect of the expected return from a stock that
frequently causes confusion and needs to be explained.
Our model of stock price behavior implies that, in a very short period of time, the
mean return is  t. It is natural to assume from this that  is the expected
continuously compounded return on the stock. However, this is not the case. The
continuously compounded return, x, actually realized over a period of time of length T
346
CHAPTER 15

is given by equation (15.6) as
x ¼ 1
T ln ST
S0
and, as indicated in equation (15.7), the expected value EðxÞ of x is   2=2.
The reason why the expected continuously compounded return is diﬀerent from  is
subtle, but important. Suppose we consider a very large number of very short periods of
time of length t. Deﬁne Si as the stock price at the end of the ith interval and Si as
Siþ1  Si. Under the assumptions we are making for stock price behavior, the average
of the returns on the stock in each interval is close to . In other words,  t is close to
the arithmetic mean of the Si=Si. However, the expected return over the whole period
covered by the data, expressed with a compounding interval of t, is close to   2=2,
not .3 Business Snapshot 15.1 provides a numerical example concerning the mutual
fund industry to illustrate why this is so.
For another explanation of what is going on, we start with equation (15.4):
EðSTÞ ¼ S0eT
Taking logarithms, we get
ln½EðSTÞ ¼ lnðS0Þ þ T
It is now tempting to set ln½EðSTÞ ¼ E½lnðSTÞ, so that E½lnðSTÞ  lnðS0Þ ¼ T, or
E½lnðST=S0Þ ¼ T, which leads to EðxÞ ¼ . However, we cannot do this because ln
is a nonlinear function. In fact, ln½EðSTÞ > E½lnðSTÞ, so that E½lnðST=S0Þ < T, which
leads to EðxÞ < . (As pointed out above, EðxÞ ¼   2=2.)
15.4
VOLATILITY
The volatility, , of a stock is a measure of our uncertainty about the returns provided
by the stock. Stocks typically have a volatility between 15% and 60%.
From equation (15.7), the volatility of a stock price can be deﬁned as the standard
deviation of the return provided by the stock in 1 year when the return is expressed
using continuous compounding.
When t is small, equation (15.1) shows that 2t is approximately equal to the
variance of the percentage change in the stock price in time t. This means that 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
is
approximately equal to the standard deviation of the percentage change in the stock
price in time t. Suppose that  ¼ 0:3, or 30%, per annum and the current stock price
is $50. The standard deviation of the percentage change in the stock price in 1 week is
approximately
30 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
52
r
¼ 4:16%
A 1-standard-deviation move in the stock price in 1 week is therefore 50  0:0416 ¼ 2:08.
Uncertainty about a future stock price, as measured by its standard deviation,
increases—at least approximately—with the square root of how far ahead we are
looking. For example, the standard deviation of the stock price in 4 weeks is approxi-
mately twice the standard deviation in 1 week.
3 The arguments in this section show that the term ‘‘expected return’’ is ambiguous. It can refer either to  or
to   2=2. Unless otherwise stated, it will be used to refer to  throughout this book.

Estimating Volatility from Historical Data
To estimate the volatility of a stock price empirically, the stock price is usually observed
at ﬁxed intervals of time (e.g., every day, week, or month). Deﬁne:

Si: Stock price at end of ith interval, with i ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; n
: Length of time interval in years

Business Snapshot 15.1
Mutual Fund Returns Can Be Misleading
The diﬀerence between  and   2=2 is closely related to an issue in the reporting of
mutual fund returns. Suppose that the following is a sequence of returns per annum
reported by a mutual fund manager over the last ﬁve years (measured using annual
compounding): 15%, 20%, 30%, 20%, 25%.
The arithmetic mean of the returns, calculated by taking the sum of the returns
and dividing by 5, is 14%. However, an investor would actually earn less than 14%
per annum by leaving the money invested in the fund for 5 years. The dollar value of
$100 at the end of the 5 years would be
100  1:15  1:20  1:30  0:80  1:25 ¼ $179:40
By contrast, a 14% return with annual compounding would give
100  1:145 ¼ $192:54
The return that gives $179.40 at the end of ﬁve years is 12.4%. This is because
100  ð1:124Þ5 ¼ 179:40
What average return should the fund manager report? It is tempting for the manager
to make a statement such as: ‘‘The average of the returns per year that we have
realized in the last 5 years is 14%.’’ Although true, this is misleading. It is much less
misleading to say: ‘‘The average return realized by someone who invested with us for
the last 5 years is 12.4% per year.’’ In some jurisdictions, regulations require fund
managers to report returns the second way.
This phenomenon is an example of a result that is well known in mathematics. The
geometric mean of a set of numbers is always less than the arithmetic mean. In our
example, the return multipliers each year are 1.15, 1.20, 1.30, 0.80, and 1.25. The
arithmetic mean of these numbers is 1.140, but the geometric mean is only 1.124 and
it is the geometric mean that equals 1 plus the return realized over the 5 years.

Choosing an appropriate value for n is not easy. More data generally lead to more
accuracy, but  does change over time and data that are too old may not be relevant for
predicting the future volatility. A compromise that seems to work reasonably well is to
use closing prices from daily data over the most recent 90 to 180 days. Alternatively, as
a rule of thumb, n can be set equal to the number of days to which the volatility is to be
applied. Thus, if the volatility estimate is to be used to value a 2-year option, daily data
for the last 2 years are used. More sophisticated approaches to estimating volatility
involving GARCH models are discussed in Chapter 23.

The foregoing analysis assumes that the stock pays no dividends, but it can be adapted
to accommodate dividend-paying stocks. The return, ui, during a time interval that
includes an ex-dividend day is given by
ui ¼ ln Si þ D
Si1
where D is the amount of the dividend. The return in other time intervals is still
ui ¼ ln Si
Si1
4 The mean u is often assumed to be zero when estimates of historical volatilities are made.

However, as tax factors play a part in determining returns around an ex-dividend date,
it is probably best to discard altogether data for intervals that include an ex-dividend
date.
Trading Days vs. Calendar Days
An important issue is whether time should be measured in calendar days or trading
days when volatility parameters are being estimated and used. As shown in Business
Snapshot 15.2, research shows that volatility is much higher when the exchange is open
for trading than when it is closed. As a result, practitioners tend to ignore days when the
exchange is closed when estimating volatility from historical data and when calculating
the life of an option. The volatility per annum is calculated from the volatility per
trading day using the formula

THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
The Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation is an equation that must be satisﬁed
by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. The equation
is derived in the next section. Here we consider the nature of the arguments we will use.
These are similar to the no-arbitrage arguments we used to value stock options in
Chapter 13 for the situation where stock price movements were assumed to be binomial.
They involve setting up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the derivative and
a position in the stock. In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the return from the
portfolio must be the risk-free interest rate, r. This leads to the Black-Scholes-Merton
diﬀerential equation.
Business Snapshot 15.2
What Causes Volatility?
It is natural to assume that the volatility of a stock is caused by new information
reaching the market. This new information causes people to revise their opinions
about the value of the stock. The price of the stock changes and volatility results.
This view of what causes volatility is not supported by research. With several years of
daily stock price data, researchers can calculate:
1. The variance of stock price returns between the close of trading on one day
and the close of trading on the next day when there are no intervening
nontrading days
2. The variance of the stock price returns between the close of trading on Friday
and the close of trading on Monday
The second of these is the variance of returns over a 3-day period. The ﬁrst is a variance
over a 1-day period. We might reasonably expect the second variance to be three times
as great as the ﬁrst variance. Fama (1965), French (1980), and French and Roll (1986)
show that this is not the case. These three research studies estimate the second variance
to be, respectively, 22%, 19%, and 10.7% higher than the ﬁrst variance.
At this stage one might be tempted to argue that these results are explained by more
news reaching the market when the market is open for trading. But research by Roll
(1984) does not support this explanation. Roll looked at the prices of orange juice
futures. By far the most important news for orange juice futures prices is news about
the weather and this is equally likely to arrive at any time. When Roll did a similar
analysis to that just described for stocks, he found that the second (Friday-to-Monday)
variance for orange juice futures is only 1.54 times the ﬁrst variance.
The only reasonable conclusion from all this is that volatility is to a large extent
caused by trading itself. (Traders usually have no diﬃculty accepting this conclusion!)
The Black–Scholes–Merton Model
351

The reason a riskless portfolio can be set up is that the stock price and the derivative
price are both aﬀected by the same underlying source of uncertainty: stock price
movements. In any short period of time, the price of the derivative is perfectly
correlated with the price of the underlying stock. When an appropriate portfolio of
the stock and the derivative is established, the gain or loss from the stock position
always oﬀsets the gain or loss from the derivative position so that the overall value of
the portfolio at the end of the short period of time is known with certainty.
Suppose, for example, that at a particular point in time the relationship between a
small change S in the stock price and the resultant small change c in the price of a
European call option is given by
c ¼ 0:4 S
This means that the slope of the line representing the relationship between c and S
is 0.4, as indicated in Figure 15.2. A riskless portfolio would consist of:
1. A long position in 40 shares
2. A short position in 100 call options.
Suppose, for example, that the stock price increases by 10 cents. The option price will
increase by 4 cents and the 40  0:1 ¼ $4 gain on the shares is equal to the 100  0:04 ¼
$4 loss on the short option position.
There is one important diﬀerence between the Black–Scholes–Merton analysis and
our analysis using a binomial model in Chapter 13. In Black–Scholes–Merton, the
position in the stock and the derivative is riskless for only a very short period of time.
(Theoretically, it remains riskless only for an instantaneously short period of time.) To
remain riskless, it must be adjusted, or rebalanced, frequently.5 For example, the
relationship between c and S in our example might change from c ¼ 0:4 S today
to c ¼ 0:5 S tomorrow. This would mean that, in order to maintain the riskless
position, an extra 10 shares would have to be purchased for each 100 call options sold.
It is nevertheless true that the return from the riskless portfolio in any very short period
of time must be the risk-free interest rate. This is the key element in the Black–Scholes–
Merton analysis and leads to their pricing formulas.

CHAPTER 15

Assumptions
The assumptions we use to derive the Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation are
as follows:
1. The stock price follows the process developed in Chapter 14 with  and  constant.
2. The short selling of securities with full use of proceeds is permitted.
3. There are no transaction costs or taxes. All securities are perfectly divisible.
4. There are no dividends during the life of the derivative.
5. There are no riskless arbitrage opportunities.
6. Security trading is continuous.
7. The risk-free rate of interest, r, is constant and the same for all maturities.
As we discuss in later chapters, some of these assumptions can be relaxed. For example,
 and r can be known functions of t. We can even allow interest rates to be stochastic
provided that the stock price distribution at maturity of the option is still lognormal.
15.6
DERIVATION OF THE BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
In this section, the notation is diﬀerent from elsewhere in the book. We consider a
derivative’s price at a general time t (not at time zero). If T is the maturity date, the time
to maturity is T  t.
The stock price process we are assuming is the one we developed in Section 14.3:
dS ¼ S dt þ S dz
ð15:8Þ
Suppose that f is the price of a call option or other derivative contingent on S. The
variable f must be some function of S and t. Hence, from equation (14.14),
df ¼

@S S þ @f
@t þ 1
2
@2f
@S 2 2S 2

dt þ @f
@S S dz
ð15:9Þ
The discrete versions of equations (15.8) and (15.9) are
S ¼ S t þ S z
ð15:10Þ
and
f ¼

@t þ 1

@2f
@S 2 2S 2

t þ @f
@S S z
ð15:11Þ
where f and S are the changes in f and S in a small time interval t. Recall from
the discussion of Itoˆ ’s lemma in Section 14.6 that the Wiener processes underlying f
and S are the same. In other words, the z (¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
Þ in equations (15.10) and (15.11)
are the same. It follows that a portfolio of the stock and the derivative can be
constructed so that the Wiener process is eliminated. The portfolio is
1: derivative
þ@f=@S: shares.
The Black–Scholes–Merton Model
353

The holder of this portfolio is short one derivative and long an amount @f=@S of
shares. Deﬁne  as the value of the portfolio. By deﬁnition
 ¼ f þ @f
@S S
ð15:12Þ
The change  in the value of the portfolio in the time interval t is given by
 ¼ f þ @f
@S S
ð15:13Þ
Substituting equations (15.10) and (15.11) into equation (15.13) yields
 ¼

@2f
@S 2 2S 2

ð15:14Þ
Because this equation does not involve z, the portfolio must be riskless during time t.
The assumptions listed in the preceding section imply that the portfolio must instant-
aneously earn the same rate of return as other short-term risk-free securities. If it earned
more than this return, arbitrageurs could make a riskless proﬁt by borrowing money to
buy the portfolio; if it earned less, they could make a riskless proﬁt by shorting the
portfolio and buying risk-free securities. It follows that
 ¼ r t
ð15:15Þ
where r is the risk-free interest rate. Substituting from equations (15.12) and (15.14) into
(15.15), we obtain
@f

ð15:16Þ
Equation (15.16) is the Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation. It has many
solutions, corresponding to all the diﬀerent derivatives that can be deﬁned with S as
the underlying variable. The particular derivative that is obtained when the equation is
solved depends on the boundary conditions that are used. These specify the values of the
derivative at the boundaries of possible values of S and t. In the case of a European call
option, the key boundary condition is
f ¼ maxðS  K; 0Þ
when t ¼ T
In the case of a European put option, it is
f ¼ maxðK  S; 0Þ
when t ¼ T
Example 15.5
A forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is a derivative dependent on
the stock. As such, it should satisfy equation (15.16). From equation (5.5), we
know that the value of the forward contract, f, at a general time t is given in terms
354
CHAPTER 15

of the stock price S at this time by
f ¼ S  KerðTtÞ
where K is the delivery price. This means that
@f
@t ¼ rKerðTtÞ;
@f
@S ¼ 1;
@2f
@S 2 ¼ 0
When these are substituted into the left-hand side of equation (15.16), we obtain
rKerðTtÞ þ rS
This equals rf, showing that equation (15.16) is indeed satisﬁed.
A Perpetual Derivative
Consider a perpetual derivative that pays oﬀa ﬁxed amount Q when the stock price
equals H for the ﬁrst time. In this case, the value of the derivative for a particular S
has no dependence on t, so the @f=@t term vanishes and the partial diﬀerential
equation (15.16) becomes an ordinary diﬀerential equation.
Suppose ﬁrst that S < H. The boundary conditions for the derivatives are f ¼ 0
when S ¼ 0 and f ¼ Q when S ¼ H. The simple solution f ¼ QS=H satisﬁes both the
boundary conditions and the diﬀerential equation. It must therefore be the value of the
derivative.
Suppose next that S > H. The boundary conditions are now f ¼ 0 as S tends to
inﬁnity and f ¼ Q when S ¼ H. The derivative price
f ¼ Q
S
H

where  is positive, satisﬁes the boundary conditions. It also satisﬁes the diﬀerential
equation when
r þ 1
22ð þ 1Þ  r ¼ 0
or  ¼ 2r=2. The value of the derivative is therefore
f ¼ Q
S
H
2r=2
ð15:17Þ
Problem 15.23 shows how equation (15.17) can be used to price a perpetual American
put option. Section 26.2 extends the analysis to show how perpetual American call and
put options can be priced when the underlying asset provides a yield at rate q.
The Prices of Tradeable Derivatives
Any function fðS; tÞ that is a solution of the diﬀerential equation (15.16) is the
theoretical price of a derivative that could be traded. If a derivative with that price
existed, it would not create any arbitrage opportunities. Conversely, if a function fðS; tÞ
does not satisfy the diﬀerential equation (15.16), it cannot be the price of a derivative
without creating arbitrage opportunities for traders.
The Black–Scholes–Merton Model
355

To illustrate this point, consider ﬁrst the function eS. This does not satisfy the
diﬀerential equation (15.16). It is therefore not a candidate for being the price of a
derivative dependent on the stock price. If an instrument whose price was always eS
existed, there would be an arbitrage opportunity. As a second example, consider the
function
eð22rÞðTtÞ
S
This does satisfy the diﬀerential equation, and so is, in theory, the price of a tradeable
security. (It is the price of a derivative that pays oﬀ1=ST at time T.) For other examples
of tradeable derivatives, see Problems 15.11, 15.12, 15.23, and 15.28.
15.7
RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION
We introduced risk-neutral valuation in connection with the binomial model in
Chapter 13. It is without doubt the single most important tool for the analysis of
derivatives. It arises from one key property of the Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential
equation (15.16). This property is that the equation does not involve any variables that
are aﬀected by the risk preferences of investors. The variables that do appear in the
equation are the current stock price, time, stock price volatility, and the risk-free rate of
interest. All are independent of risk preferences.
The Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation would not be independent of risk
preferences if it involved the expected return, , on the stock. This is because the value
of  does depend on risk preferences. The higher the level of risk aversion by investors,
the higher  will be for any given stock. It is fortunate that  happens to drop out in
the derivation of the diﬀerential equation.
Because the Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation is independent of risk
preferences, an ingenious argument can be used. If risk preferences do not enter the
equation, they cannot aﬀect its solution. Any set of risk preferences can, therefore, be
used when evaluating f. In particular, the very simple assumption that all investors are
risk neutral can be made.
In a world where investors are risk neutral, the expected return on all investment
assets is the risk-free rate of interest, r. The reason is that risk-neutral investors do not
require a premium to induce them to take risks. It is also true that the present value of
any cash ﬂow in a risk-neutral world can be obtained by discounting its expected value
at the risk-free rate. The assumption that the world is risk neutral does, therefore,
considerably simplify the analysis of derivatives.
Consider a derivative that provides a payoﬀat one particular time. It can be valued
using risk-neutral valuation by using the following procedure:
1. Assume that the expected return from the underlying asset is the risk-free interest
rate, r (i.e., assume  ¼ r).
2. Calculate the expected payoﬀfrom the derivative.
3. Discount the expected payoﬀat the risk-free interest rate.
It is important to appreciate that risk-neutral valuation (or the assumption that all
investors are risk neutral) is merely an artiﬁcial device for obtaining solutions to the
356
CHAPTER 15

Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation. The solutions that are obtained are valid
in all worlds, not just those where investors are risk neutral. When we move from a risk-
neutral world to a risk-averse world, two things happen. The expected growth rate in
the stock price changes and the discount rate that must be used for any payoﬀs from the
derivative changes. It happens that these two changes always oﬀset each other exactly.
Application to Forward Contracts on a Stock
We valued forward contracts on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 5.7. In
Example 15.5, we veriﬁed that the pricing formula satisﬁes the Black–Scholes–Merton
diﬀerential equation. In this section we derive the pricing formula from risk-neutral
valuation. We make the assumption that interest rates are constant and equal to r. This
is somewhat more restrictive than the assumption in Chapter 5.
Consider a long forward contract that matures at time T with delivery price, K. As
indicated in Figure 1.2, the value of the contract at maturity is
ST  K
where ST is the stock price at time T. From the risk-neutral valuation argument, the
value of the forward contract at time 0 is its expected value at time T in a risk-neutral
world discounted at the risk-free rate of interest. Denoting the value of the forward
contract at time zero by f, this means that
f ¼ erT ^EðST  KÞ
where ^E denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. Since K is a constant, this
equation becomes
f ¼ erT ^EðSTÞ  KerT
ð15:18Þ
The expected return  on the stock becomes r in a risk-neutral world. Hence, from
equation (15.4), we have
^EðSTÞ ¼ S0erT
ð15:19Þ
Substituting equation (15.19) into equation (15.18) gives
f ¼ S0  KerT
This is in agreement with equation (5.5).
15.8
BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON PRICING FORMULAS
The most famous solutions to the diﬀerential equation (15.16) are the Black–Scholes–
Merton formulas for the prices of European call and put options. These formulas are:
c ¼ S0Nðd1Þ  KerTNðd2Þ
ð15:20Þ
and
p ¼ KerTNðd2Þ  S0Nðd1Þ

The function NðxÞ is the cumulative probability distribution function for a variable with
a standard normal distribution. In other words, it is the probability that a variable with
a standard normal distribution will be less than x. It is illustrated in Figure 15.3. The
remaining variables should be familiar. The variables c and p are the European call and
European put price, S0 is the stock price at time zero, K is the strike price, r is the
continuously compounded risk-free rate,  is the stock price volatility, and T is the time
to maturity of the option.
One way of deriving the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas is by solving the diﬀer-
ential equation (15.16) subject to the boundary condition mentioned in Section 15.6.6
(See Problem 15.17 to prove that the call price in equation (15.20) satisﬁes the
diﬀerential equation.) Another approach is to use risk-neutral valuation. Consider a
European call option. The expected value of the option at maturity in a risk-neutral
world is
^E½maxðST  K; 0Þ
where, as before, ^E denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. From the risk-
neutral valuation argument, the European call option price c is this expected value
discounted at the risk-free rate of interest, that is,
c ¼ erT ^E½maxðST  K; 0Þ

CHAPTER 15

The appendix at the end of this chapter shows that this equation leads to the result in
equation (15.20).
Since it is never optimal to exercise early an American call option on a non-dividend-
paying stock (see Section 11.5), equation (15.20) is the value of an American call option
on a non-dividend-paying stock. Unfortunately, no exact analytic formula for the value
of an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock has been produced.
Numerical procedures for calculating American put values are discussed in Chapter 21.
When the Black–Scholes–Merton formula is used in practice the interest rate r is set
equal to the zero-coupon risk-free interest rate for a maturity T. As we show in later
chapters, this is theoretically correct when r is a known function of time. It is also
theoretically correct when the interest rate is stochastic provided that the stock price at
time T is lognormal and the volatility parameter is chosen appropriately. As mentioned
earlier, time is normally measured as the number of trading days left in the life of the
option divided by the number of trading days in 1 year.
Understanding Nðd1Þ and Nðd2Þ
The term Nðd2Þ in equation (15.20) has a fairly simple interpretation. It is the prob-
ability that a call option will be exercised in a risk-neutral world. The Nðd1Þ term is not
quite so easy to interpret. The expression S0Nðd1ÞerT is the expected stock price at
time T in a risk-neutral world when stock prices less than the strike price are counted as
zero. The strike price is only paid if the stock price is greater than K and as just
mentioned this has a probability of Nðd2Þ. The expected payoﬀin a risk-neutral world is
therefore
S0Nðd1ÞerT  KNðd2Þ
Present-valuing this from time T to time zero gives the Black–Scholes–Merton equation
for a European call option:
c ¼ S0Nðd1Þ  KerTNðd2Þ
For another interpretation, note that the Black–Scholes–Merton equation for the value
of a European call option can be written as
c ¼ erTNðd2Þ½S0erTNðd1Þ=Nðd2Þ  K
The terms here have the following interpretation:
erT : Present value factor
Nðd2Þ: Probability of exercise
erTNðd1Þ=Nðd2Þ: Expected percentage increase in stock price in a risk-neutral world
if option is exercised
K: Strike price paid if option is exercised.
Properties of the Black–Scholes–Merton Formulas
We now show that the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas have the right general proper-
ties by considering what happens when some of the parameters take extreme values.
When the stock price, S0, becomes very large, a call option is almost certain to be
exercised. It then becomes very similar to a forward contract with delivery price K.
The Black–Scholes–Merton Model
359

From equation (5.5), we expect the call price to be
S0  KerT
This is, in fact, the call price given by equation (15.20) because, when S0 becomes very
large, both d1 and d2 become very large, and Nðd1Þ and Nðd2Þ become close to 1.0.
When the stock price becomes very large, the price of a European put option, p,
approaches zero. This is consistent with equation (15.21) because Nðd1Þ and Nðd2Þ
are both close to zero in this case.
Consider next what happens when the volatility  approaches zero. Because the stock
is virtually riskless, its price will grow at rate r to S0erT at time T and the payoﬀfrom a
call option is
maxðS0erT  K; 0Þ
Discounting at rate r, the value of the call today is
erT maxðS0erT  K; 0Þ ¼ maxðS0  KerT; 0Þ
To show that this is consistent with equation (15.20), consider ﬁrst the case where
S0 > KerT. This implies that ln ðS0=KÞ þ rT > 0. As  tends to zero, d1 and d2 tend to
þ1, so that Nðd1Þ and Nðd2Þ tend to 1.0 and equation (15.20) becomes
c ¼ S0  KerT
When S0 < KerT, it follows that lnðS0=KÞ þ rT < 0. As  tends to zero, d1 and d2
tend to 1, so that Nðd1Þ and Nðd2Þ tend to zero and equation (15.20) gives a call
price of zero. The call price is therefore always maxðS0  KerT; 0Þ as  tends to zero.
Similarly, it can be shown that the put price is always maxðKerT  S0; 0Þ as  tends
to zero.
15.9
CUMULATIVE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
When implementing equations (15.20) and (15.21), it is necessary to evaluate the
cumulative normal distribution function NðxÞ. Tables for NðxÞ are provided at the
end of this book. The NORMSDIST function in Excel also provides a convenient
way of calculating NðxÞ.
Example 15.6
The stock price 6 months from the expiration of an option is $42, the exercise price
of the option is $40, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and the volatility
is 20% per annum. This means that S0 ¼ 42, K ¼ 40, r ¼ 0:1,  ¼ 0:2, T ¼ 0:5,
d1 ¼ lnð42=40Þ þ ð0:1 þ 0:22=2Þ  0:5

and

CHAPTER 15

Hence, if the option is a European call, its value c is given by
c ¼ 42Nð0:7693Þ  38:049Nð0:6278Þ
If the option is a European put, its value p is given by
p ¼ 38:049Nð0:6278Þ  42Nð0:7693Þ
Using the NORMSDIST function in Excel gives
Nð0:7693Þ ¼ 0:7791;
Nð0:6278Þ ¼ 0:7349;
Nð0:7693Þ ¼ 0:2209
Nð0:6278Þ ¼ 0:2651
so that
c ¼ 4:76;
p ¼ 0:81
Ignoring the time value of money, the stock price has to rise by $2.76 for the
purchaser of the call to break even. Similarly, the stock price has to fall by $2.81
for the purchaser of the put to break even.
15.10
WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS
The exercise of a regular call option on a company has no eﬀect on the number of the
company’s shares outstanding. If the writer of the option does not own the company’s
shares, he or she must buy them in the market in the usual way and then sell them to the
option holder for the strike price. As explained in Chapter 10, warrants and employee
stock options are diﬀerent from regular call options in that exercise leads to the
company issuing more shares and then selling them to the option holder for the strike
price. As the strike price is less than the market price, this dilutes the interest of the
existing shareholders.
How should potential dilution aﬀect the way we value outstanding warrants and
employee stock options? The answer is that it should not! Assuming markets are
eﬃcient the stock price will reﬂect potential dilution from all outstanding warrants
and employee stock options. This is explained in Business Snapshot 15.3.7
Consider next the situation a company is in when it is contemplating a new issue of
warrants (or employee stock options). We suppose that the company is interested in
calculating the cost of the issue assuming that there are no compensating beneﬁts. We
assume that the company has N shares worth S0 each and the number of new options
contemplated is M, with each option giving the holder the right to buy one share for K.
The value of the company today is NS0. This value does not change as a result of the
warrant issue. Suppose that without the warrant issue the share price will be ST at the
warrant’s maturity. This means that (with or without the warrant issue) the total value
of the equity and the warrants at time T will NST. If the warrants are exercised, there is a
cash inﬂow from the strike price increasing this to NST þ MK. This value is distributed
7 Analysts sometimes assume that the sum of the values of the warrants and the equity (rather than just the
value of the equity) is lognormal. The result is a Black–Scholes type of equation for the value of the warrant in
terms of the value of the warrant. See Technical Note 3 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes
for an explanation of this model.

This shows that the value of each option is the value of

regular call options on the company’s stock. Therefore the total cost of the options is
M times this. Since we are assuming that there are no beneﬁts to the company from the
warrant issue, the total value of the company’s equity will decline by the total cost of
the options as soon as the decision to issue the warrants becomes generally known. This
means that the reduction in the stock price is
M
N þ M
times the value of a regular call option with strike price K and maturity T.
Business Snapshot 15.3
Warrants, Employee Stock Options, and Dilution
Consider a company with 100,000 shares each worth $50. It surprises the market with
an announcement that it is granting 100,000 stock options to its employees with a
strike price of $50. If the market sees little beneﬁt to the shareholders from the
employee stock options in the form of reduced salaries and more highly motivated
managers, the stock price will decline immediately after the announcement of the
employee stock options. If the stock price declines to $45, the dilution cost to the
current shareholders is $5 per share or $500,000 in total.
Suppose that the company does well so that by the end of three years the share
price is $100. Suppose further that all the options are exercised at this point. The
payoﬀto the employees is $50 per option. It is tempting to argue that there will be
further dilution in that 100,000 shares worth $100 per share are now merged with
100,000 shares for which only $50 is paid, so that (a) the share price reduces to $75
and (b) the payoﬀto the option holders is only $25 per option. However, this
argument is ﬂawed. The exercise of the options is anticipated by the market and
already reﬂected in the share price. The payoﬀfrom each option exercised is $50.
This example illustrates the general point that when markets are eﬃcient the
impact of dilution from executive stock options or warrants is reﬂected in the stock
price as soon as they are announced and does not need to be taken into account
again when the options are valued.

CHAPTER 15

Example 15.7
A company with 1 million shares worth $40 each is considering issuing 200,000
warrants each giving the holder the right to buy one share with a strike price of
$60 in 5 years. It wants to know the cost of this. The interest rate is 3% per
annum, and the volatility is 30% per annum. The company pays no dividends.
From equation (15.20), the value of a 5-year European call option on the stock is
$7.04. In this case, N ¼ 1,000,000 and M ¼ 200,000, so that the value of each
warrant is
1,000,000
1,000,000 þ 200,000  7:04 ¼ 5:87
or $5.87. The total cost of the warrant issue is 200,000  5:87 ¼ $1:17 million.
Assuming the market perceives no beneﬁts from the warrant issue, we expect the
stock price to decline by $1.17 to $38.83.
15.11
IMPLIED VOLATILITIES
The one parameter in the Black–Scholes–Merton pricing formulas that cannot be
directly observed is the volatility of the stock price. In Section 15.4, we discussed
how this can be estimated from a history of the stock price. In practice, traders usually
work with what are known as implied volatilities. These are the volatilities implied by
option prices observed in the market.8
To illustrate how implied volatilities are calculated, suppose that the value of a
European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is 1.875 when S0 ¼ 21; K ¼ 20,
r ¼ 0:1, and T ¼ 0:25. The implied volatility is the value of  that, when substituted
into equation (15.20), gives c ¼ 1:875. Unfortunately, it is not possible to invert equa-
tion (15.20) so that  is expressed as a function of S0, K, r, T, and c. However, an
iterative search procedure can be used to ﬁnd the implied . For example, we can start
by trying  ¼ 0:20. This gives a value of c equal to 1.76, which is too low. Because c is
an increasing function of , a higher value of  is required. We can next try a value of
0.30 for . This gives a value of c equal to 2.10, which is too high and means that 
must lie between 0.20 and 0.30. Next, a value of 0.25 can be tried for . This also proves
to be too high, showing that  lies between 0.20 and 0.25. Proceeding in this way, we
can halve the range for  at each iteration and the correct value of  can be calculated
to any required accuracy.9 In this example, the implied volatility is 0.235, or 23.5%, per
annum. A similar procedure can be used in conjunction with binomial trees to ﬁnd
implied volatilities for American options.
Implied volatilities are used to monitor the market’s opinion about the volatility of a
particular stock. Whereas historical volatilities (see Section 15.4) are backward looking,
implied volatilities are forward looking. Traders often quote the implied volatility of an
option rather than its price. This is convenient because the implied volatility tends to be
less variable than the option price. As will be explained in Chapter 20, the implied
8 Implied volatilities for European and American options can be calculated using DerivaGem.
9 This method is presented for illustration. Other more powerful methods, such as the Newton–Raphson
method, are often used in practice (see footnote 3 of Chapter 4).

volatilities of actively traded options are used by traders to estimate appropriate implied
volatilities for other options.
The VIX Index
The CBOE publishes indices of implied volatility. The most popular index, the SPX
VIX, is an index of the implied volatility of 30-day options on the S&P 500 calculated
from a wide range of calls and puts.10 It is sometimes referred to as the ‘‘fear factor.’’
An index value of 15 indicates that the implied volatility of 30-day options on the
S&P 500 is estimated as 15%. Information on the way the index is calculated is in
Section 26.15. Trading in futures on the VIX started in 2004 and trading in options on
the VIX started in 2006. One contract is on 1,000 times the index.
Example 15.8
Suppose that a trader buys an April futures contract on the VIX when the futures
price is 18.5 (corresponding to a 30-day S&P 500 volatility of 18.5%) and closes
out the contract when the futures price is 19.3 (corresponding to an S&P 500
volatility of 19.3%). The trader makes a gain of $800.
A trade involving futures or options on the S&P 500 is a bet on both the future level of
the S&P 500 and the volatility of the S&P 500. By contrast, a futures or options contract
on the VIX is a bet only on volatility. Figure 15.4 shows the VIX index between January
2004 and June 2013. Between 2004 and mid-2007 it tended to stay between 10 and 20. It
reached 30 during the second half of 2007 and a record 80 in October and November
2008 after Lehman’s bankruptcy. By early 2010, it had declined to a more normal
levels, but it spiked again in May 2010 and the second half of 2011 because of stresses
and uncertainties in ﬁnancial markets.

CHAPTER 15

15.12
DIVIDENDS
Up to now, we have assumed that the stock on which the option is written pays no
dividends. In this section, we modify the Black–Scholes–Merton model to take account
of dividends. We assume that the amount and timing of the dividends during the life of
an option can be predicted with certainty. When options last for relatively short periods
of time, this assumption is not too unreasonable. (For long-life options it is usual to
assume that the dividend yield rather the dollar dividend payments are known. Options
can then be valued as will be described in the Chapter 17.) The date on which the
dividend is paid should be assumed to be the ex-dividend date. On this date the stock
price declines by the amount of the dividend.11
European Options
European options can be analyzed by assuming that the stock price is the sum of two
components: a riskless component that corresponds to the known dividends during
the life of the option and a risky component. The riskless component, at any given
time, is the present value of all the dividends during the life of the option discounted
from the ex-dividend dates to the present at the risk-free rate. By the time the option
matures, the dividends will have been paid and the riskless component will no longer
exist. The Black–Scholes–Merton formula is therefore correct if S0 is equal to the
risky component of the stock price and  is the volatility of the process followed by
the risky component.12
Operationally, this means that the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas can be used
provided that the stock price is reduced by the present value of all the dividends during
the life of the option, the discounting being done from the ex-dividend dates at the risk-
free rate. As already mentioned, a dividend is counted as being during the life of the
option only if its ex-dividend date occurs during the life of the option.
Example 15.9
Consider a European call option on a stock when there are ex-dividend dates in
two months and ﬁve months. The dividend on each ex-dividend date is expected
to be $0.50. The current share price is $40, the exercise price is $40, the stock price
volatility is 30% per annum, the risk-free rate of interest is 9% per annum, and
the time to maturity is six months. The present value of the dividends is
0:5e0:092=12 þ 0:5e0:095=12 ¼ 0:9742
The option price can therefore be calculated from the Black–Scholes–Merton
11 For tax reasons the stock price may go down by somewhat less than the cash amount of the dividend. To
take account of this phenomenon, we need to interpret the word ‘dividend’ in the context of option pricing as
the reduction in the stock price on the ex-dividend date caused by the dividend. Thus, if a dividend of $1 per
share is anticipated and the share price normally goes down by 80% of the dividend on the ex-dividend date,
the dividend should be assumed to be $0.80 for the purpose of the analysis.
12 This is not quite the same as the volatility of the whole stock price. (In theory, they cannot both follow
geometric Brownian motion.) At time zero, the volatility of the risky component is approximately equal to
the volatility of the whole stock price multiplied by S0=ðS0  DÞ, where D is the present value of the
dividends.

or $3.67.
Some researchers have criticized the approach just described for calculating the value
of a European option on a dividend-paying stock. They argue that volatility should be
applied to the stock price, not to the stock price less the present value of dividends.
A number of diﬀerent numerical procedures have been suggested for doing this.13 When
volatility is calculated from historical data, it might make sense to use one of these
procedures. However, in practice the volatility used to price an option is nearly always
implied from the prices of other options using procedures we will outline in Chapter 20.
If an analyst uses the same model for both implying and applying volatilities, the
resulting prices should be accurate and not highly model dependent. Another important
point is that in practice, as will be explained in Chapter 18, practitioners usually value a
European option in terms of the forward price of the underlying asset. This avoids the
need to estimate explicitly the income that is expected from the asset. The volatility of
the forward stock price is the same as the volatility of the stock price minus the present
value of dividends.
The model we have proposed where the stock price is divided into two components is
internally consistent and widely used in practice. We will use the same model when
valuing American options in Chapter 21.
American Call Options
Consider next American call options. Chapter 11 showed that in the absence of
dividends American options should never be exercised early. An extension to the
argument shows that, when there are dividends, it can only be optimal to exercise at
a time immediately before the stock goes ex-dividend. We assume that n ex-dividend
dates are anticipated and that they are at times t1, t2, . . . , tn, with t1 < t2 <    < tn.
The dividends corresponding to these times will be denoted by D1, D2, . . . , Dn,
respectively.
We start by considering the possibility of early exercise just prior to the ﬁnal
ex-dividend date (i.e., at time tn). If the option is exercised at time tn, the investor
receives
SðtnÞ  K
13 See, for example, N. Areal and A. Rodrigues, ‘‘Fast Trees for Options with Discrete Dividends,’’ Journal
of Derivatives, 21, 1 (Fall 2013), 49–63.

CHAPTER 15

where SðtÞ denotes the stock price at time t. If the option is not exercised, the stock
price drops to SðtnÞ  Dn. As shown by equation (11.4), the value of the option is then
greater than
SðtnÞ  Dn  KerðTtnÞ
It follows that, if
SðtnÞ  Dn  KerðTtnÞ > SðtnÞ  K
that is,
Dn 6 K1  erðTtnÞ
ð15:24Þ
it cannot be optimal to exercise at time tn. On the other hand, if
Dn > K

1  erðTtnÞ
ð15:25Þ
for any reasonable assumption about the stochastic process followed by the stock price,
it can be shown that it is always optimal to exercise at time tn for a suﬃciently high
value of SðtnÞ. The inequality in (15.25) will tend to be satisﬁed when the ﬁnal ex-
dividend date is fairly close to the maturity of the option (i.e., T  tn is small) and the
dividend is large.
Consider next time tn1, the penultimate ex-dividend date. If the option is exercised
immediately prior to time tn1, the investor receives Sðtn1Þ  K. If the option is not
exercised at time tn1, the stock price drops to Sðtn1Þ  Dn1 and the earliest
subsequent time at which exercise could take place is tn. Hence, from equation (11.4),
a lower bound to the option price if it is not exercised at time tn1 is
Sðtn1Þ  Dn1  Kerðtntn1Þ
It follows that if
Sðtn1Þ  Dn1  Kerðtntn1Þ > Sðtn1Þ  K
or
Dn1 6 K

1  erðtntn1Þ
it is not optimal to exercise immediately prior to time tn1. Similarly, for any i < n, if
Di 6 K

1  erðtiþ1tiÞ
ð15:26Þ
it is not optimal to exercise immediately prior to time ti.
The inequality in (15.26) is approximately equivalent to
Di 6 Krðtiþ1  tiÞ
Assuming that K is fairly close to the current stock price, this inequality is satisﬁed
when the dividend yield on the stock is less than the risk-free rate of interest. This is
often the case.
We can conclude from this analysis that, in many circumstances, the most likely
time for the early exercise of an American call is immediately before the ﬁnal ex-
dividend date, tn. Furthermore, if inequality (15.26) holds for i ¼ 1, 2, . . . , n  1 and
inequality (15.24) holds, we can be certain that early exercise is never optimal, and the
American option can be treated as a European option.
The Black–Scholes–Merton Model
367

Black’s Approximation
Black suggests an approximate procedure for taking account of early exercise in call
options.14 This involves calculating, as described earlier in this section, the prices of
European options that mature at times T and tn, and then setting the American price
equal to the greater of the two.15 This is an approximation because it in eﬀect assumes
the option holder has to decide at time zero whether the option will be exercised at
time T or tn.
SUMMARY
We started this chapter by examining the properties of the process for stock prices
introduced in Chapter 14. The process implies that the price of a stock at some future
time, given its price today, is lognormal. It also implies that the continuously com-
pounded return from the stock in a period of time is normally distributed. Our
uncertainty about future stock prices increases as we look further ahead. The standard
deviation of the logarithm of the stock price is proportional to the square root of how
far ahead we are looking.
To estimate the volatility  of a stock price empirically, the stock price is observed at
ﬁxed intervals of time (e.g., every day, every week, or every month). For each time
period, the natural logarithm of the ratio of the stock price at the end of the time period
to the stock price at the beginning of the time period is calculated. The volatility is
estimated as the standard deviation of these numbers divided by the square root of the
length of the time period in years. Usually, days when the exchanges are closed are
ignored in measuring time for the purposes of volatility calculations.
The diﬀerential equation for the price of any derivative dependent on a stock can be
obtained by creating a riskless portfolio of the derivative and the stock. Because the
derivative’s price and the stock price both depend on the same underlying source of
uncertainty, this can always be done. The portfolio that is created remains riskless for
only a very short period of time. However, the return on a riskless porfolio must always
be the risk-free interest rate if there are to be no arbitrage opportunities.
The expected return on the stock does not enter into the Black–Scholes–Merton
diﬀerential equation. This leads to an extremely useful result known as risk-neutral
valuation. This result states that when valuing a derivative dependent on a stock price,
we can assume that the world is risk neutral. This means that we can assume that the
expected return from the stock is the risk-free interest rate, and then discount expected
payoﬀs at the risk-free interest rate. The Black–Scholes–Merton equations for Eur-
opean call and put options can be derived by either solving their diﬀerential equation or
by using risk-neutral valuation.
An implied volatility is the volatility that, when used in conjunction with the Black–

1975): 36–41, 61–72.
15 For an exact formula, suggested by Roll, Geske, and Whaley, for valuing American calls when there is
only one ex-dividend date, see Technical Note 4 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes. This

given in Technical Note 5 and a worksheet for calculating the cumulative bivariate normal distribution can be

CHAPTER 15

Scholes–Merton option pricing formula, gives the market price of the option. Traders
monitor implied volatilities. They often quote the implied volatility of an option rather
than its price. They have developed procedures for using the volatilities implied by the
prices of actively traded options to estimate volatilities for other options.
The Black–Scholes–Merton results can be extended to cover European call and put
options on dividend-paying stocks. The procedure is to use the Black–Scholes–Merton
formula with the stock price reduced by the present value of the dividends anticipated
during the life of the option, and the volatility equal to the volatility of the stock price
net of the present value of these dividends.
In theory, it can be optimal to exercise American call options immediately before any
ex-dividend date. In practice, it is often only necessary to consider the ﬁnal ex-dividend
date. Fischer Black has suggested an approximation. This involves setting the American
call option price equal to the greater of two European call option prices. The ﬁrst
European call option expires at the same time as the American call option; the second
expires immediately prior to the ﬁnal ex-dividend date.

Employee
Stock Options
Employee stock options are call options on a company’s stock granted by the company
to its employees. The options give the employees a stake in the fortunes of the
company. If the company does well so that the company’s stock price moves above
the strike price, employees gain by exercising the options and then selling the stock they
acquire at the market price.
Many companies, particularly technology companies, feel that the only way they can
attract and keep the best employees is to oﬀer them attractive stock option packages.
Some companies grant options only to senior management; others grant them to people
at all levels in the organization. Microsoft was one of the ﬁrst companies to use employee
stock options. All Microsoft employees were granted options and, as the company’s
stock price rose, it is estimated that over 10,000 of them became millionaires. Employee
stock options have become less popular in recent years for reasons we will explain in this
chapter. (Microsoft, for example, announced in 2003 that it would discontinue the use of
options and award shares of Microsoft to employees instead.) But many companies
throughout the world continue to be enthusiastic users of employee stock options.
Employee stock options are popular with start-up companies. Often these companies
do not have the resources to pay key employees as much as they could earn with an
established company and they solve this problem by supplementing the salaries of the
employees with stock options. If the company does well and shares are sold to the
public in an IPO, the options are likely to prove to be very valuable. Some newly
formed companies have even granted options to students who worked for just a few
months during their summer break—and in some cases this has led to windfalls of
hundreds of thousands of dollars for the students.
This chapter explains how stock option plans work and how their popularity has been
inﬂuenced by their accounting treatment. It discusses whether employee stock options
help to align the interests of shareholders with those of top executives running a com-
pany. It also describes how these options are valued and looks at backdating scandals.
16.1
CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS
Employee stock options often last as long as 10 to 15 years. Very often the strike price is
set equal to the stock price on the grant date so that the option is initially at the money.
376
16
C H A P T E R

The following are usually features employee stock option plans:
1. There is a vesting period during which the options cannot be exercised. This
vesting period can be as long as four years.
2. When employees leave their jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily) during the vesting
period, they forfeit their options.
3. When employees leave (voluntarily or involuntarily) after the vesting period, they
forfeit options that are out of the money and they have to exercise vested options
that are in the money almost immediately.
4. Employees are not permitted to sell the options.
5. When an employee exercises options, the company issues new shares and sells
them to the employee for the strike price.
The Early Exercise Decision
The fourth feature of employee stock option plans noted above has important implica-
tions. If employees, for whatever reason, want to realize a cash beneﬁt from options that
have vested, they must exercise the options and sell the underlying shares. They cannot
sell the options to someone else. This leads to a tendency for employee stock options to
be exercised earlier than similar exchange-traded or over-the-counter call options.
Consider a call option on a stock paying no dividends. In Section 11.5 we showed that,
if it is a regular call option, it should never be exercised early. The holder of the option
will always do better by selling the option rather than exercising it before the end of its
life. However, the arguments we used in Section 11.5 are not applicable to employee
stock options because they cannot be sold. The only way employees can realize a cash
beneﬁt from the options (or diversify their holdings) is by exercising the options and
selling the stock. It is therefore not unusual for an employee stock option to be exercised
well before it would be optimal to exercise the option if it were a regular exchange-traded
or over-the-counter option.
Should an employee ever exercise his or her options before maturity and then keep
the stock rather than selling it? Assume that the option’s strike price is constant during
the life of the option and the option can be exercised at any time. To answer the
question we consider two options: the employee stock option and an otherwise identical
regular option that can be sold in the market. We refer to the ﬁrst option as option A
and the second as option B. If the stock pays no dividends, we know that option B
should never be exercised early. It follows that it is not optimal to exercise option A and
keep the stock. If the employee wants to maintain a stake in his or her company, a
better strategy is to keep the option. This delays paying the strike price and maintains
the insurance value of the option, as described in Section 11.5. Only when it is optimal
to exercise option B can it be a rational strategy for an employee to exercise option A
before maturity and keep the stock.1 As discussed in Section 15.12, it is optimal to
exercise option B only when a relatively high dividend is imminent.
In practice the early exercise behavior of employees varies widely from company to
company. In some companies, there is a culture of not exercising early; in others,
employees tend to exercise options and sell the stock soon after the end of the vesting
period, even if the options are only slightly in the money.
1 The only exception to this could be when an executive wants to own the stock for its voting rights.

16.2
DO OPTIONS ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS
AND MANAGERS?
For investors to have conﬁdence in capital markets, it is important that the interests of
shareholders and managers are reasonably well aligned. This means that managers
should be motivated to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
Managers are the agents of the shareholders and, as mentioned in Chapter 8, economists
use the term agency costs to describe the losses experienced when the interests of agents
and principals are not aligned.
Do employee stock options help align the interests of employees and shareholders?
The answer to this question is not straightforward. There can be little doubt that they
serve a useful purpose for a start-up company. The options are an excellent way for the
main shareholders, who are usually also senior executives, to motivate employees to
work long hours. If the company is successful and there is an IPO, the employees will
do very well; but if the company is unsuccessful, the options will be worthless.
It is the options granted to the senior executives of publicly traded companies that are
most controversial. It has been estimated that employee stock options account for about
50% of the remuneration of top executives in the United States. Executive stock options
are sometimes referred to as an executive’s ‘‘pay for performance.’’ If the company’s
stock price goes up, so that shareholders make gains, the executive is rewarded.
However, this overlooks the asymmetric payoﬀs of options. If the company does badly
then the shareholders lose money, but all that happens to the executives is that they fail
to make a gain. Unlike the shareholders, they do not experience a loss.2 Many people
think that a better type of pay for performance is a restricted stock unit. This entitles the
executive to own a share of the company’s stock at a particular future time (the vesting
date). The gains and losses of the executives then mirror those of other shareholders. It
is sometimes argued that the asymmetric payoﬀs of options can lead to senior
executives taking risks they would not otherwise take. This may or may not be in the
interests of the company’s shareholders.
What temptations do stock options create for a senior executive? Suppose an
executive plans to exercise a large number of stock options in three months and sell
the stock. He or she might be tempted to time announcements of good news—or even
move earnings from one quarter to another—so that the stock price increases just
before the options are exercised. Alternatively, if at-the-money options are due to be
granted to the executive in three months, the executive might be tempted to take actions
that reduce the stock price just before the grant date. The type of behavior we are
talking about here is of course totally unacceptable—and may well be illegal. But the
backdating scandals, which are discussed later in this chapter, show that the way some
executives have handled issues related to stock options leaves much to be desired.
Even when there is no impropriety of the type we have just mentioned, executive
stock options are liable to have the eﬀect of motivating executives to focus on short-
term proﬁts at the expense of longer-term performance. Managers of large funds worry
that, because stock options are such a huge component of an executive’s compensation,
they are liable to be a big source of distraction. Senior management may spend too
2 When options have moved out of the money, companies have sometimes replaced them with new at-the-
money options. This practice known as ‘‘repricing’’ leads to the executive’s gains and losses being even less
closely tied to those of the shareholders.
378
CHAPTER 16

much time thinking about all the diﬀerent aspects of their compensation and not
enough time running the company.
A manager’s inside knowledge and ability to aﬀect outcomes and announcements is
always liable to interact with his or her trading in a way that is to the disadvantage of
other shareholders. One radical suggestion for mitigating this problem is to require
executives to give notice to the market—perhaps one week’s notice—of an intention to
buy or sell their company’s stock.3 (Once the notice of an intention to trade had been
given, it would be binding on the executive.) This allows the market to form its own
conclusions about why the executive is trading. As a result, the price may increase
before the executive buys and decrease before the executive sells.
16.3
ACCOUNTING ISSUES
An employee stock option represents a cost to the company and a beneﬁt to the employee
just like any other form of compensation. This point, which for many is self-evident, is
actually quite controversial. Many corporate executives appear to believe that an option
has no value unless it is in the money. As a result, they argue that an at-the-money option
issued by the company is not a cost to the company. The reality is that, if options are
valuable to employees, they must represent a cost to the company’s shareholders—and
therefore to the company. There is no free lunch. The cost to the company of the options
arises from the fact that the company has agreed that, if its stock does well, it will sell
shares to employees at a price less than that which would apply in the open market.
Prior to 1995 the cost charged to the income statement of a company when it issued
stock options was the intrinsic value. Most options were at the money when they were
ﬁrst issued, so that this cost was zero. In 1995, accounting standard FAS 123 was
issued. Many people expected it to require the expensing of options at their fair value.
However, as a result of intense lobbying, the 1995 version of FAS 123 only encouraged
companies to expense the fair value of the options they granted on the income
statement. It did not require them to do so. If fair value was not expensed on the
income statement, it had to be reported in a footnote to the company’s accounts.
Accounting standards have now changed to require the expensing of all stock-based
compensation at its fair value on the income statement. In February 2004 the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board issued IAS 2 requiring companies to start
expensing stock options in 2005. In December 2004 FAS 123 was revised to require
the expensing of employee stock options in the United States starting in 2005.
The eﬀect of the new accounting standards is to require options to be valued on the
grant date and the amount to be recorded as an expense in the income statement for the
year in which the grant is made. Valuation at a time later than the grant date is not
required. It can be argued that options should be revalued at ﬁnancial year ends (or
every quarter) until they are exercised or reach the end of their lives.4 This would treat
them in the same way as other derivative transactions entered into by the company. If
the option became more valuable from one year to the next, there would then be an
3 This would apply to the exercise of options because, if an executive wants to exercise options and sell the
stock that is acquired, then he or she would have to give notice of intention to sell.

Valuation Issues,’’ Journal of Derivatives Accounting, 1, 1 (2004): 3–9.

additional amount to be expensed. However, if it declined in value, there would be a
positive impact on income.
This approach would have a number of advantages. The cumulative charge to the
company would reﬂect the actual cost of the options (either zero if the options are not
exercised or the option payoﬀif they are exercised). Although the charge in any year
would depend on the option pricing model used, the cumulative charge over the life of
the option would not.5 Arguably there would be much less incentive for the company to
engage in the backdating practices described later in the chapter. The disadvantage
usually cited for accounting in this way is that it is undesirable because it introduces
volatility into the income statement.6
Alternatives to Stock Options
The accounting rules which came into eﬀect in 2005 have led companies to consider
alternatives to traditional compensation plans where at-the-money stock options are
granted. We have already mentioned restricted stock units (RSUs), which are shares
that will be owned by the employee at a future time (the vesting date). Many companies
have replaced stock options by RSUs. A variation on an RSU is a market-leveraged
stock unit (MSU), in which the number of shares that will be owned on the vesting date
is equal to ST=S0, where S0 is the stock price on the grant date and ST is the stock price
on the vesting date.7
If the stock market as a whole goes up, employees with stock options tend to do well,
even if their own company’s stock price does less well than the market. One way of
overcoming this problem is to tie the strike price of the options to the performance of
the S&P 500. Suppose that on the option grant date the stock price is $30 and the
S&P 500 is 1,500. The strike price would initially be set at $30. If the S&P 500 increased
by 10% to 1,650, then the strike price would also increase by 10% to $33. If the
S&P 500 moved down by 15% to 1,275, then the strike price would also move down by
15% to $25.50. The eﬀect of this is that the company’s stock price performance has to
beat the performance of the S&P 500 to become in the money. As an alternative to
using the S&P 500 as the reference index, the company could use an index of the prices
of stocks in the same industrial sector as the company.
16.4
VALUATION
Accounting standards give companies quite a bit of latitude in choosing a method for
valuing employee stock options. In this section we review some of the alternatives.
5 Interestingly, if an option is settled in cash rather than by the company issuing new shares, it is subject to
the accounting treatment proposed here. (However, there is no economic diﬀerence between an option that is
settled in cash and one that is settled by selling new shares to the employee.)
6 In fact the income statement is likely be less volatile if stock options are revalued. When the company does
well, income is reduced by revaluing the executive stock options. When the company does badly, it is
increased.
7 Sometimes there is an upper and lower bound to the number of shares which will vest and sometimes S0
and ST are deﬁned as average stock prices over a number of days preceding the grant data and vesting date,
respectively. For an analysis of MSUs, see J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘The Valuation of Market-Leveraged Stock
Units,’’ Working Paper, University of Toronto, 2013.
380
CHAPTER 16

The ‘‘Quick and Dirty’’ Approach
A frequently used approach is based on what is known as the option’s expected life. This
is the average time for which employees hold the option before it is exercised or expires.
The expected life can be approximately estimated from historical data on the early
exercise behavior of employees and reﬂects the vesting period, the impact of employees
leaving the company, and the tendency we mentioned in Section 16.1 for employee stock
options to be exercised earlier than regular options. The Black–Scholes–Merton model is
used with the life of the option, T, set equal to the expected life. The volatility is usually
estimated from several years of historical data as described in Section 15.4.
It should be emphasized that using the Black–Scholes–Merton formula in this way
has no theoretical validity. There is no reason why the value of a European stock option
with the time to maturity, T, set equal to the expected life should be approximately the
same as the value of the American-style employee stock option that we are interested in.
However, the results given by the model are not unreasonable. Companies, when
reporting their employee stock option expense, will frequently mention the volatility
and expected life used in their Black–Scholes–Merton computations.
Example 16.1
A company grants 1,000,000 options to its executives on November 1, 2014. The
stock price on that date is $30 and the strike price of the options is also $30. The
options last for 10 years and vest after three years. The company has issued
similar at-the-money options for the last 10 years. The average time to exercise
or expiry of these options is 4.5 years. The company therefore decides to use an
‘‘expected life’’ of 4.5 years. It estimates the long-term volatility of the stock
price, using 5 years of historical data, to be 25%. The present value of dividends
during the next 4.5 years is estimated to be $4. The 4.5-year zero-coupon risk-free
interest rate is 5%. The option is therefore valued using the Black–Scholes–
Merton model (adjusted for dividends in the way described in Section 15.12)
with S0 ¼ 30  4 ¼ 26, K ¼ 30, r ¼ 5%,  ¼ 25%, and T ¼ 4:5. The Black–
Scholes–Merton formula gives the value of one option as $6.31. Hence, the
income statement expense is 1,000,000  6:31, or $6,310,000.
Binomial Tree Approach
A more sophisticated approach to valuing employee stock options involves building a
binomial tree as outlined in Chapter 13 and adjusting the rules used when rolling back
through the tree to reﬂect (a) whether the option has vested, (b) the probability of the
employee leaving the company, and (c) the probability of the employee choosing to
exercise the option. The terms of the option deﬁne whether the option has vested at
diﬀerent nodes of the tree. Historical data on turnover rates for employees can be used
to estimate the probability of the option being either prematurely exercised or forfeited
at a node because the employee leaves the company. The probability of an employee
choosing to exercise the option at diﬀerent nodes of the tree is more diﬃcult to
quantify. Clearly this probability increases as the ratio of the stock price to the strike
price increases and as the time to the option’s maturity declines. If enough historical
data is available, the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables can be
estimated—at least approximately.
Employee Stock Options

Example 16.2
Suppose a company grants stock options that last 8 years and vest after 3 years.
The stock price and strike price are both $40. The stock price volatility is 30%, the
risk-free rate is 5%, and the company pays no dividends. Figure 16.1 shows how a
four-step tree could be used to value the option. (This is for illustration; in practice
more time steps would be used.) In this case,  ¼ 0:3, t ¼ 2, and r ¼ 0:05, so

branches’’ is 0.5158 and the probability on the ‘‘down branches’’ is 0.4842. There
are three nodes where early exercise could be desirable: D, G, and H. (The option
has not vested at node B and is not in the money at the other nodes prior to
maturity.) We assume that the probabilities that the holder will choose to exercise
at nodes D, G, and H (conditional on no earlier exercise) have been estimated as
40%, 80%, and 30%, respectively. We suppose that the probability of an employee
leaving the company during each time step is 5%. (This corresponds to an em-
ployee turnover rate of approximately 2.5% per year.) For the purposes of the
calculation, it is assumed that employees always leave at the end of a time period.
If an employee leaves the company before an option has vested or when the option
is out of the money, the option is forfeited. In other cases the option must be
exercised immediately.

CHAPTER 16

The value of the option at the ﬁnal nodes is its intrinsic value. Consider the
nodes at time 6 years. Nodes I and J are easy. Since these nodes are certain to lead
to nodes where the option is worth nothing, the value of the option is zero at
these nodes. At node H there is a 30% chance that the employee will choose to
exercise the option. In cases where the employee does not choose to exercise, there
is a 5% chance that the employee leaves the company and has to exercise. The
total probability of exercise is therefore 0:3 þ 0:7  0:05 ¼ 0:335. If the option is
exercised, its value is 61:14  40 ¼ 21:14. If it is not exercised, its value is
e0:052ð0:5158  53:45 þ 0:4842  0Þ ¼ 24:95
The value of the option at node H is therefore
0:335  21:14 þ 0:665  24:95 ¼ 23:67
The value at node G is similarly
0:81  102:83 þ 0:19  106:64 ¼ 103:56
We now move on to the nodes at time 4 years. At node F the option is clearly
worth zero. At node E there is a 5% chance that the employee will forfeit the
option because he or she leaves the company and a 95% chance that the option
will be retained. In the latter case the option is worth
e0:052ð0:5158  23:67 þ 0:4842  0Þ ¼ 11:05
The option is therefore worth 0:95  11:05 ¼ 10:49. At node D there is a 0.43
probability that the option will be exercised and a 0.57 chance that it will be
retained. The value of the option is 56.44.
Consider next the initial node and the nodes at time 2 years. The option has not
vested at these nodes. There is a 5% chance that the option will be forfeited and a
95% chance that it will be retained for a further 2 years. This leads to the
valuations shown in Figure 16.1. The valuation of the option at the initial node
is 14.97. (This compares with a valuation of 17.98 for a regular option using the
same tree.)
The Exercise Multiple Approach
Hull and White suggest a simple model where an employee exercises as soon as the
option has vested and the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is above a certain
level.8 They refer to the ratio of stock price to strike price that triggers exercise as the
‘‘exercise multiple’’. The option can be valued using a binomial or trinomial tree. As
outlined in Section 27.6, it is important to construct a binomial or trinomial tree where
nodes lie on the stock prices that will lead to exercise. For example, if the strike price is
$30 and the assumption is that employees exercise when the ratio of the stock price to
the strike price is 1.5, the tree should be constructed so that there are nodes at a stock
price level of $45. The tree calculations are similar to those for Example 16.2 and take
account of the probability of an employee leaving the company.9 To estimate the
exercise multiple, it is necessary to calculate from historical data the average ratio of
8 See J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘How to value employee stock options,’’ Financial Analysts Journal, 60, 1
(January/February 2004): 3–9.

stock price to strike price at the time of exercise. (Exercises at maturity and those arising
from the termination of the employee’s job are not included in the calculation of the
average.) This may be easier to estimate from historical data than the expected life
because the latter is quite heavily dependent on the particular path that has been
followed by the stock’s price.
A Market-Based Approach
One way of valuing an employee stock option is to see what the market would pay for
it. Cisco was the ﬁrst to try this in 2006. It proposed selling options with the exact terms
of its employee stock options to institutional investors. This approach was rejected by
the SEC on the grounds that the range of investors bidding for the options was not
wide enough.
Zions Bancorp has suggested an alternative approach. It proposed that securities
providing payoﬀs mirroring those actually realized by its employees be sold. Suppose
that the strike price for a particular grant to employees is $40 and it turns out that 1%
of employees exercise after exactly 5 years when the stock price is $60, 2% exercise after
exactly 6 years when the stock price is $65, and so on. Then 1% of the securities owned
by an investor will provide a $20 payoﬀafter 5 years, 2% will provide a payoﬀof $25
after 6 years, and so on.
Zions Bancorp tested the idea using its own stock option grant to its employees. It
sold the securities using a Dutch auction process. In this individuals or companies can
submit a bid indicating the price they are prepared to pay and the number of options
they are prepared to buy. The clearing price is the highest bid such that the aggregate
number of options sought at that price or a higher price equals or exceeds the number
of options for sale. Buyers who have bid more than the clearing price get their orders
ﬁlled at the clearing price and the buyer who bid the clearing price gets the remainder.
Zions Bancorp announced that it had received SEC approval for its market-based
approach in October 2007, but the approach has not been used to any great extent.
Dilution
The fact that a company issues new stock when an employee stock option is exercised
leads to some dilution for existing stock holders because new shares are being sold to
employees at below the current stock price. It is natural to assume that this dilution
takes place at the time the option is exercised. However, this is not the case. As
explained in Section 15.10, stock prices are diluted when the market ﬁrst hears about
a stock option grant. The possible exercise of options is anticipated and immediately
reﬂected in the stock price. This point is emphasized by the example in Business
Snapshot 15.3.
The stock price immediately after a grant is announced to the public reﬂects any
dilution. Provided that this stock price is used in the valuation of the option, it is not
necessary to adjust the option price for dilution. In many instances the market expects a
company to make regular stock option grants and so the market price of the stock
anticipates dilution even before the announcement is made.
If a company is contemplating a stock option grant that will surprise the market, the
cost can be calculated as described in Example 15.7. This cost can be compared with
beneﬁts such as lower regular employee remuneration and less employee turnover.

CHAPTER 16

16.5
BACKDATING SCANDALS
No discussion of employee stock options would be complete without mentioning
backdating scandals. Backdating is the practice of marking a document with a date
that precedes the current date.
Suppose that a company decides to grant at-the-money options to its executives on
April 30 when the stock price is $50. If the stock price was $42 on April 3, it is tempting to
behave as if those the options were granted on April 3 and use a strike price of $42. This is
legal provided that the company reports the options as $8 in the money on the date when
the decision to grant the options is made, April 30. But it is illegal for the company to
report the options as at-the-money and granted on April 3. The value on April 3 of an
option with a strike price of $42 is much less than its value on April 30. Shareholders are
misled about the true cost of the decision to grant options if the company reports the
options as granted on April 3.
How prevalent is backdating? To answer this question, researchers have investigated
whether a company’s stock price has, on average, a tendency to be low at the time of
the grant date that the company reports. Early research by Yermack shows that stock
prices tend to increase after reported grant dates.10 Lie extended Yermack’s work,
showing that stock prices also tended to decrease before reported grant dates.11
Furthermore he showed that the pre- and post-grant stock price patterns had become
more pronounced over time. His results are summarized in Figure 16.2, which shows
average abnormal returns around the grant date for the 1993–94, 1995–98, and 1999–
2002 periods. (Abnormal returns are the returns after adjustments for returns on the
market portfolio and the beta of the stock.) Standard statistical tests show that it is
almost impossible for the patterns shown in Figure 16.2 to be observed by chance.
This led both academics and regulators to conclude in 2002 that backdating had
become a common practice. In August 2002 the SEC required option grants by public
companies to be reported within two business days. Heron and Lie showed that this
led to a dramatic reduction in the abnormal returns around the grant dates—
particularly for those companies that complied with this requirement.12 It might be
argued that the patterns in Figure 16.2 are explained by managers simply choosing
grant dates after bad news or before good news, but the Heron and Lie study provides
compelling evidence that this is not the case.
Estimates of the number of companies that illegally backdated stock option grants in
the United States vary widely. Tens and maybe hundreds of companies seem to have
engaged in the practice. Many companies seem to have adopted the view that it was
acceptable to backdate up to one month. Some CEOs resigned when their backdating
practices came to light. In August 2007, Gregory Reyes of Brocade Communications
Systems, Inc., became the ﬁrst CEO to be tried for backdating stock option grants.
Allegedly, Mr. Reyes said to a human resources employee: ‘‘It is not illegal if you do
not get caught.’’ In June 2010, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ﬁned
$15 million.

of Finance, 52 (1997), 449–476.

grants,’’ Journal of Financial Economics, 83, 2 (February 2007), 271–95.
Employee Stock Options
385

Companies involved in backdating have had to restate past ﬁnancial statements and
have been defendants in class action suits brought by shareholders who claim to have
lost money as a result of backdating. For example, McAfee announced in December
2007 that it would restate earnings between 1995 and 2005 by $137.4 million. In 2006, it
set aside $13.8 million to cover lawsuits.
SUMMARY
Executive compensation has increased very fast in the last 20 years and much of the
increase has come from the exercise of stock options granted to the executives. Until
2005 at-the-money stock option grants were a very attractive form of compensation.
They had no impact on the income statement and were very valuable to employees.
Accounting standards now require options to be expensed.
There are a number of diﬀerent approaches to valuing employee stock options. A
common approach is to use the Black–Scholes–Merton model with the life of the
option set equal to the expected time to exercise or expiry of the option. Another
approach is to assume that options are exercised as soon as the ratio of the stock price
to the strike price reaches a certain barrier. A third approach is to try and estimate the
relationship between the probability of exercise, the ratio of the stock price to the
strike price, and the time to option maturity. A fourth approach is to create a market
for securities that replicate the payoﬀs on the options.
Academic research has shown beyond doubt that many companies have engaged in
the illegal practice of backdating stock option grants in order to reduce the strike price,
while still contending that the options were at the money. The ﬁrst prosecutions for this
illegal practice were in 2007.

CHAPTER 16

Options on
Stock Indices and
Currencies
Options on stock indices and currencies were introduced in Chapter 10. This chapter
discusses them in more detail. It explains how they work and reviews some of the ways
they can be used. In the second half of the chapter, the valuation results in Chapter 15
are extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. It is
then argued that both stock indices and currencies are analogous to stocks paying
dividend yields. This enables the results for options on a stock paying a dividend yield
to be applied to these types of options as well.
17.1
OPTIONS ON STOCK INDICES
Several exchanges trade options on stock indices. Some of the indices track the move-
ment of the market as a whole. Others are based on the performance of a particular
sector (e.g., computer technology, oil and gas, transportation, or telecoms). Among the
index options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are American
and European options on the S&P 100 (OEX and XEO), European options on the S&P
500 (SPX), European options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJX), and Euro-
pean options on the Nasdaq 100 (NDX). In Chapter 10, we explained that the CBOE
trades LEAPS and ﬂex options on individual stocks. It also oﬀers these option products
on indices.
One index option contract is on 100 times the index. (Note that the Dow Jones index
used for index options is 0.01 times the usually quoted Dow Jones index.) Index options
are settled in cash. This means that, on exercise of the option, the holder of a call option
contract receives ðS  KÞ  100 in cash and the writer of the option pays this amount in
cash, where S is the value of the index at the close of trading on the day of the exercise
and K is the strike price. Similarly, the holder of a put option contract receives
ðK  SÞ  100 in cash and the writer of the option pays this amount in cash.
Portfolio Insurance
Portfolio managers can use index options to limit their downside risk. Suppose that the
value of an index today is S0. Consider a manager in charge of a well-diversiﬁed portfolio
whose beta is 1.0. A beta of 1.0 implies that the returns from the portfolio mirror those
389
17
C H A P T E R

from the index. Assuming the dividend yield from the portfolio is the same as the
dividend yield from the index, the percentage changes in the value of the portfolio can
be expected to be approximately the same as the percentage changes in the value of the
index. Since each contract is on 100 times the index, it follows that the value of the
portfolio is protected against the possibility of the index falling below K if, for each 100S0
dollars in the portfolio, the manager buys one put option contract with strike price K.
Suppose that the manager’s portfolio is worth $500,000 and the value of the index is
1,000. The portfolio is worth 500 times the index. The manager can obtain insurance
against the value of the portfolio dropping below $450,000 in the next three months by
buying ﬁve three-month put option contracts on the index with a strike price of 900.
To illustrate how the insurance works, consider the situation where the index drops
to 880 in three months. The portfolio will be worth about $440,000. The payoﬀfrom
the options will be 5  ð900  880Þ  100 ¼ $10,000, bringing the total value of the
portfolio up to the insured value of $450,000.
When the Portfolio’s Beta Is Not 1.0
If the portfolio’s beta () is not 1.0,  put options must be purchased for each 100S0
dollars in the portfolio, where S0 is the current value of the index. Suppose that the
$500,000 portfolio just considered has a beta of 2.0 instead of 1.0. We continue to
assume that the index is 1,000. The number of put options required is
2:0 
500,000
1,000  100 ¼ 10
rather than 5 as before.
To calculate the appropriate strike price, the capital asset pricing model can be used
(see the appendix to Chapter 3). Suppose that the risk free rate is 12%, the dividend
yield on both the index and the portfolio is 4%, and protection is required against the
value of the portfolio dropping below $450,000 in the next three months. Under the
capital asset pricing model, the expected excess return of a portfolio over the risk-free

rate is assumed to equal beta times the excess return of the index portfolio over the risk-
free rate. The model enables the expected value of the portfolio to be calculated for
diﬀerent values of the index at the end of three months. Table 17.1 shows the calcula-
tions for the case where the index is 1,040. In this case, the expected value of the
portfolio at the end of the three months is $530,000. Similar calculations can be carried
out for other values of the index at the end of the three months. The results are shown in
Table 17.2. The strike price for the options that are purchased should be the index level
corresponding to the protection level required on the portfolio. In this case, the
protection level is $450,000 and so the correct strike price for the 10 put option contracts
that are purchased is 960.1
To illustrate how the insurance works, consider what happens if the value of the
index falls to 880. As shown in Table 17.2, the value of the portfolio is then about
$370,000. The put options pay oﬀð960  880Þ  10  100 ¼ $80,000, and this is exactly
what is necessary to move the total value of the portfolio manager’s position up from
$370,000 to the required level of $450,000.
The examples in this section show that there are two reasons why the cost of hedging
increases as the beta of a portfolio increases. More put options are required and they
have a higher strike price.
17.2
CURRENCY OPTIONS
Currency options are primarily traded in the over-the-counter market. The advantage
of this market is that large trades are possible, with strike prices, expiration dates, and
other features tailored to meet the needs of corporate treasurers. Although currency
options do trade on NASDAQ OMX in the United States, the exchange-traded market
for these options is much smaller than the over-the-counter market.
An example of a European call option is a contract that gives the holder the right to
buy one million euros with US dollars at an exchange rate of 1.3000 US dollars per
euro. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 1.3500, the payoﬀis

1,000,000  ð1:3500  1:3000Þ ¼ $50,000. Similarly, an example of a European put
option is a contract that gives the holder the right to sell ten million Australian
dollars for US dollars at an exchange rate of 0.9000 US dollars per Australian dollar.
If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 0.8700, the payoﬀis
10,000,000  ð0:9000  0:8700Þ ¼ $300,000.
For a corporation wishing to hedge a foreign exchange exposure, foreign currency
options are an alternative to forward contracts. A US company due to receive sterling at a
known time in the future can hedge its risk by buying put options on sterling that mature
at that time. The hedging strategy guarantees that the exchange rate applicable to the
sterling will not be less than the strike price, while allowing the company to beneﬁt from
any favorable exchange-rate movements. Similarly, a US company due to pay sterling at
a known time in the future can hedge by buying calls on sterling that mature at that time.
This hedging strategy guarantees that the cost of the sterling will not be greater than a
certain amount while allowing the company to beneﬁt from favorable exchange-rate
movements. Whereas a forward contract locks in the exchange rate for a future trans-
action, an option provides a type of insurance. This is not free. It costs nothing to enter
into a forward transaction, but options require a premium to be paid up front.
Range Forwards
A range forward contract is a variation on a standard forward contract for hedging
foreign exchange risk. Consider a US company that knows it will receive one million
pounds sterling in three months. Suppose that the three-month forward exchange rate is
1.5200 dollars per pound. The company could lock in this exchange rate for the dollars
it receives by entering into a short forward contract to sell one million pounds sterling
in three months. This would ensure that the amount received for the one million
pounds is $1,520,000.
An alternative is to buy a European put option with a strike price of K1 and sell a
European call option with a strike price K2, where K1 < 1:5200 < K2. This is known as a
short position in a range forward contract. The payoﬀis shown in Figure 17.1a. In both
cases, the options are on one million pounds. If the exchange rate in three months proves
to be less than K1, the put option is exercised and as a result the company is able to sell

the one million pounds at an exchange rate of K1. If the exchange rate is between K1 and
K2, neither option is exercised and the company gets the current exchange rate for the
one million pounds. If the exchange rate is greater than K2, the call option is exercised
against the company and the one million pounds is sold at an exchange rate of K2. The
exchange rate realized for the one million pounds is shown in Figure 17.2.
If the company knew it was due to pay rather than receive one million pounds in three
months, it could sell a European put option with strike price K1 and buy a European
call option with strike price K2. This is a long position in a range forward contract and
the payoﬀis shown in Figure 17.1b. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less
than K1, the put option is exercised against the company and as a result the company
buys the one million pounds it needs at an exchange rate of K1. If the exchange rate is
between K1 and K2, neither option is exercised and the company buys the one million
pounds at the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate is greater than K2, the call
option is exercised and the company is able to buy the one million pounds at an
exchange rate of K2. The exchange rate paid for the one million pounds is the same
as that received for the one million pounds in the earlier example and is shown in
Figure 17.2.
In practice, a range forward contract is set up so that the price of the put option
equals the price of the call option. This means that it costs nothing to set up the range
forward contract, just as it costs nothing to set up a regular forward contract. Suppose
that the US and British interest rates are both 5%, so that the spot exchange rate is
1.5200 (the same as the forward exchange rate). Suppose further that the exchange rate
volatility is 14%. We can use DerivaGem to show that a European put with strike price
1.5000 to sell one pound has the same price as a European call option with a strike price
of 1.5413 to buy one pound. (Both are worth 0.03250.) Setting K1 ¼ 1:5000 and
K2 ¼ 1:5413 therefore leads to a contract with zero cost in our example.

As the strike prices of the call and put options in a range forward contract are moved
together, the range forward contract becomes a regular forward contract. The (short)
range forward contract in Figure 17.1a becomes a short forward contract and the (long)
range forward contract in Figure 17.1b becomes a long forward contract.

OPTIONS ON STOCKS PAYING KNOWN DIVIDEND YIELDS
In this section we produce a simple rule that enables valuation results for European
options on a non-dividend-paying stock to be extended so that they apply to European
options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. Later we show how this enables us to
value options on stock indices and currencies.
Dividends cause stock prices to reduce on the ex-dividend date by the amount of
the dividend payment. The payment of a dividend yield at rate q therefore causes the
growth rate in the stock price to be less than it would otherwise be by an amount q. If,
with a dividend yield of q, the stock price grows from S0 today to ST at time T, then
in the absence of dividends it would grow from S0 today to STeqT at time T.
Alternatively, in the absence of dividends it would grow from S0eqT today to ST at
time T.
This argument shows that we get the same probability distribution for the stock price
at time T in each of the following two cases:
1. The stock starts at price S0 and provides a dividend yield at rate q.
2. The stock starts at price S0eqT and pays no dividends.
This leads to a simple rule. When valuing a European option lasting for time T on a
stock paying a known dividend yield at rate q, we reduce the current stock price from S0
to S0eqT and then value the option as though the stock pays no dividends.2
Lower Bounds for Option Prices
As a ﬁrst application of this rule, consider the problem of determining bounds for the
price of a European option on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate q. Substituting
S0eqT for S0 in equation (11.4), we see that a lower bound for the European call option
price, c, is given by
c > max

S0eqT  KerT; 0

ð17:1Þ
We can also prove this directly by considering the following two portfolios:
Portfolio A : one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to KerT
Portfolio B : eqT shares with dividends being reinvested in additional shares.
To obtain a lower bound for a European put option, we can similarly replace S0 by
S0eqT in equation (11.5) to get
p > max

KerT  S0eqT; 0

ð17:2Þ
2 This rule is analogous to the one developed in Section 15.12 for valuing a European option on a stock
paying known cash dividends. (In that case we concluded that it is correct to reduce the stock price by the
present value of the dividends; in this case we discount the stock price at the dividend yield rate.)
394
CHAPTER 17

This result can also be proved directly by considering the following portfolios:
Portfolio C : one European put option plus eqT shares with dividends on the shares
being reinvested in additional shares
Portfolio D : an amount of cash equal to KerT.
Put–Call Parity
Replacing S0 by S0eqT in equation (11.6) we obtain put–call parity for an option on a
stock paying a dividend yield at rate q:
c þ KerT ¼ p þ S0eqT
ð17:3Þ
This result can also be proved directly by considering the following two portfolios:
Portfolio A : one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to KerT
Portfolio C : one European put option plus eqT shares with dividends on the shares
being reinvested in additional shares.
Both portfolios are both worth maxðST; KÞ at time T. They must therefore be worth the
same today, and the put–call parity result in equation (17.3) follows. For American
options, the put–call parity relationship is (see Problem 17.12)
S0eqT  K 6 C  P 6 S0  KerT
Pricing Formulas
By replacing S0 by S0eqT in the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas, equations (15.20)
and (15.21), we obtain the price, c, of a European call and the price, p, of a European
put on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate q as
c ¼ S0eqTNðd1Þ  KerTNðd2Þ
ð17:4Þ
p ¼ KerTNðd2Þ  S0eqTNðd1Þ

Since

These results were ﬁrst derived by Merton.3 As discussed in Chapter 15, the word
dividend should, for the purposes of option valuation, be deﬁned as the reduction in the
stock price on the ex-dividend date arising from any dividends declared. If the dividend
yield rate is known but not constant during the life of the option, equations (17.4)

Science, 4 (Spring 1973): 141–83.
Options on Stock Indices and Currencies
395

and (17.5) are still true, with q equal to the average annualized dividend yield during the
option’s life.
Differential Equation and Risk-Neutral Valuation
To prove the results in equations (17.4) and (17.5) more formally, we can either solve
the diﬀerential equation that the option price must satisfy or use risk-neutral valuation.
When we include a dividend yield of q in the analysis in Section 15.6, the diﬀerential
equation (15.16) becomes4
@f
@t þ ðr  qÞS @f
@S þ 1
22S2 @2f
@S2 ¼ rf
ð17:6Þ
Like equation (15.16), this does not involve any variable aﬀected by risk preferences.
Therefore the risk-neutral valuation procedure described in Section 15.7 can be used.
In a risk-neutral world, the total return from the stock must be r. The dividends
provide a return of q. The expected growth rate in the stock price must therefore be
r  q. It follows that the risk-neutral process for the stock price is
dS ¼ ðr  qÞS dt þ S dz
ð17:7Þ
To value a derivative dependent on a stock that provides a dividend yield equal to q, we
set the expected growth rate of the stock equal to r  q and discount the expected payoﬀ
at rate r. When the expected growth rate in the stock price is r  q, the expected stock
price at time T is S0eðrqÞT. A similar analysis to that in the appendix to Chapter 15 gives
the expected payoﬀfor a call option in a risk-neutral world as
eðrqÞTS0Nðd1Þ  KNðd2Þ
where d1 and d2 are deﬁned as above. Discounting at rate r for time T leads to
equation (17.4).
17.4
VALUATION OF EUROPEAN STOCK INDEX OPTIONS
In valuing index futures in Chapter 5, we assumed that the index could be treated as an
asset paying a known yield. In valuing index options, we make similar assumptions.
This means that equations (17.1) and (17.2) provide a lower bound for European index
options; equation (17.3) is the put–call parity result for European index options;
equations (17.4) and (17.5) can be used to value European options on an index; and
the binomial tree approach can be used for American options. In all cases, S0 is equal to
the value of the index,  is equal to the volatility of the index, and q is equal to the
average annualized dividend yield on the index during the life of the option.
Example 17.1
Consider a European call option on the S&P 500 that is two months from maturity.
The current value of the index is 930, the exercise price is 900, the risk-free interest
rate is 8% per annum, and the volatility of the index is 20% per annum. Dividend

CHAPTER 17

yields of 0.2% and 0.3% are expected in the ﬁrst month and the second month,
respectively. In this case S0 ¼ 930, K ¼ 900, r ¼ 0:08,  ¼ 0:2, and T ¼ 2=12. The
total dividend yield during the option’s life is 0:2% þ 0:3% ¼ 0:5%. This corres-
ponds to 3% per annum. Hence, q ¼ 0:03 and
d1 ¼ lnð930=900Þ þ ð0:08  0:03 þ 0:22=2Þ  2=12

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

2=12
p

Nðd1Þ ¼ 0:7069;
Nðd2Þ ¼ 0:6782
so that the call price, c, is given by equation (17.4) as
c ¼ 930  0:7069e0:032=12  900  0:6782e0:082=12 ¼ 51:83
One contract would cost $5,183.
The calculation of q should include only dividends for which the ex-dividend dates
occur during the life of the option. In the United States ex-dividend dates tend to occur
during the ﬁrst week of February, May, August, and November. At any given time the
correct value of q is therefore likely to depend on the life of the option. This is even
more true for indices in other countries. In Japan, for example, all companies tend to
use the same ex-dividend dates.
If the absolute amount of the dividend that will be paid on the stocks underlying the
index (rather than the dividend yield) is assumed to be known, the basic Black–
Scholes–Merton formulas can be used with the initial stock price being reduced by
the present value of the dividends. This is the approach recommended in Chapter 15 for
a stock paying known dividends. However, it may be diﬃcult to implement for a
broadly based stock index because it requires a knowledge of the dividends expected
on every stock underlying the index.
It is sometimes argued that, in the long run, the return from investing a certain
amount of money in a well-diversiﬁed stock portfolio is almost certain to beat the
return from investing the same amount of money in a bond portfolio. If this were so, a
long-dated put option allowing the stock portfolio to be sold for the value of the bond
portfolio should not cost very much. In fact, as indicated by Business Snapshot 17.1, it
is quite expensive.
Forward Prices
Deﬁne F0 as the forward price of the index for a contract with maturity T. As shown by
equation (5.3), F0 ¼ S0eðrqÞT. This means that the equations for the European call price
c and the European put price p in equations (17.4) and (17.5) can be written
c ¼ F0erTNðd1Þ  KerTNðd2Þ
ð17:8Þ
p ¼ KerTNðd2Þ  F0erTNðd1Þ

The put–call parity relationship in equation (17.3) can be written
c þ KerT ¼ p þ F0erT
or
F0 ¼ K þ ðc  pÞerT
ð17:10Þ
If, as is not uncommon in the exchange-traded markets, pairs of puts and calls with the
same strike price are traded actively for a particular maturity date, this equation can be
used to estimate the forward price of the index for that maturity date. Once the forward
prices of the index for a number of diﬀerent maturity dates have been obtained, the
term structure of forward prices can be estimated, and other options can be valued
using equations (17.8) and (17.9). The advantage of this approach is that the dividend
yield on the index does not have to be estimated explicitly.
Implied Dividend Yields
If estimates of the dividend yield are required (e.g., because an American option is
being valued), calls and puts with the same strike price and time to maturity can again
be used. From equation (17.3),
q ¼  1

Business Snapshot 17.1
Can We Guarantee that Stocks Will Beat Bonds in
the Long Run?
It is often said that if you are a long-term investor you should buy stocks rather
than bonds. Consider a US fund manager who is trying to persuade investors to
buy, as a long-term investment, an equity fund that is expected to mirror the
S&P 500. The manager might be tempted to oﬀer purchasers of the fund a
guarantee that their return will be at least as good as the return on risk-free bonds
over the next 10 years. Historically stocks have outperformed bonds in the United
States over almost any 10-year period. It appears that the fund manager would not
be giving much away.
In fact, this type of guarantee is surprisingly expensive. Suppose that an equity
index is 1,000 today, the dividend yield on the index is 1% per annum, the volatility
of the index is 15% per annum, and the 10-year risk-free rate is 5% per annum. To
outperform bonds, the stocks underlying the index must earn more than 5% per
annum. The dividend yield will provide 1% per annum. The capital gains on the
stocks must therefore provide 4% per annum. This means that we require the index
level to be at least 1,000e0:0410 ¼ 1,492 in 10 years.
A guarantee that the return on $1,000 invested in the index will be greater than the
return on $1,000 invested in bonds over the next 10 years is therefore equivalent to
the right to sell the index for 1,492 in 10 years. This is a European put option on the
index and can be valued from equation (17.5) with S0 ¼ 1,000, K ¼ 1,492, r ¼ 5%,
 ¼ 15%, T ¼ 10, and q ¼ 1%. The value of the put option is 169.7. This shows that
the guarantee contemplated by the fund manager is worth about 17% of the fund—
hardly something that should be given away!
398
CHAPTER 17

For a particular strike price and time to maturity, the estimates of q calculated from this
equation are liable to be unreliable. But when the results from many matched pairs of
calls and puts are combined, a clearer picture of the term structure of dividend yields
being assumed by the market emerges.
17.5
VALUATION OF EUROPEAN CURRENCY OPTIONS
To value currency options, we deﬁne S0 as the spot exchange rate. To be precise, S0 is
the value of one unit of the foreign currency in US dollars. As explained in Section 5.10,
a foreign currency is analogous to a stock paying a known dividend yield. The owner of
foreign currency receives a yield equal to the risk-free interest rate, rf, in the foreign
currency. Equations (17.1) and (17.2), with q replaced by rf, provide bounds for the
European call price, c, and the European put price, p:
c > max

S0erf T  KerT; 0

p > max

KerT  S0erf T; 0

Equation (17.3), with q replaced by rf, provides the put–call parity result for European
currency options:
c þ KerT ¼ p þ S0erf T
Finally, equations (17.4) and (17.5) provide the pricing formulas for European currency
options when q is replaced by rf :
c ¼ S0erf TNðd1Þ  KerTNðd2Þ
ð17:11Þ
p ¼ KerTNðd2Þ  S0erf TNðd1Þ

Both the domestic interest rate, r, and the foreign interest rate, rf, are the rates for a
maturity T.
Example 17.2
Consider a 4-month European call option on the British pound. Suppose that the
current exchange rate is 1.6000, the exercise price is 1.6000, the risk-free interest rate
in the United States is 8% per annum, the risk-free interest rate in Britain is 11% per
annum, and the option price is 4.3 cents. In this case, S0 ¼ 1:6, K ¼ 1:6, r ¼ 0:08,
rf ¼ 0:11, T ¼ 0:3333, and c ¼ 0:043. The implied volatility can be calculated by
trial and error. A volatility of 20% gives an option price of 0.0639; a volatility of
10% gives an option price of 0.0285; and so on. The implied volatility is 14.1%.
Put and call options on a currency are symmetrical in that a put option to sell one unit
of currency A for currency B at strike price K is the same as a call option to buy K units
of B with currency A at strike price 1=K (see Problem 17.8).

Using Forward Exchange Rates
Because banks and other ﬁnancial institutions trade forward contracts on foreign
exchange rates actively, forward exchange rates are often used for valuing options.
From equation (5.9), the forward rate, F0, for a maturity T is given by
F0 ¼ S0eðrrf ÞT
This relationship allows equations (17.11) and (17.12) to be simpliﬁed to
c ¼ erT½F0Nðd1Þ  KNðd2Þ
ð17:13Þ
p ¼ erT½KNðd2Þ  F0Nðd1Þ

Equations (17.13) and (17.14) are the same as equations (17.8) and (17.9). As we shall
see in Chapter 18, a European option on the spot price of any asset can be valued in
terms of the price of a forward or futures contract on the asset using equations (17.13)
and (17.14). The maturity of the forward or futures contract must be the same as the
maturity of the European option.
17.6
AMERICAN OPTIONS
As described in Chapter 13, binomial trees can be used to value American options on
indices and currencies. As in the case of American options on a non-dividend-paying
stock, the parameter determining the size of up movements, u, is set equal to e ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
,
where  is the volatility and t is the length of time steps. The parameter determining
the size of down movements, d, is set equal to 1=u, or e ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
. For a non-dividend-
paying stock, the probability of an up movement is
p ¼ a  d
u  d
where a ¼ ert. For options on indices and currencies, the formula for p is the same,
but a is deﬁned diﬀerently. In the case of options on an index,
a ¼ eðrqÞt
ð17:15Þ
where q is the dividend yield on the index. In the case of options on a currency,
a ¼ eðrrf Þt
ð17:16Þ
where rf is the foreign risk-free rate. Example 13.1 in Section 13.11 shows how a two-step
tree can be constructed to value an option on an index. Example 13.2 shows how a three-
step tree can be constructed to value an option on a currency. Further examples of the use
of binomial trees to value options on indices and currencies are given in Chapter 21.

CHAPTER 17

In some circumstances, it is optimal to exercise American currency and index options
prior to maturity. Thus, American currency and index options are worth more than
their European counterparts. In general, call options on high-interest currencies and
put options on low-interest currencies are the most likely to be exercised prior to
maturity. The reason is that a high-interest currency is expected to depreciate and a
low-interest currency is expected to appreciate. Similarly, call options on indices with
high-dividend yields and put options on indices with low-dividend yields are most likely
to be exercised early.
SUMMARY
The index options that trade on exchanges are settled in cash. On exercise of an index
call option, the holder receives 100 times the amount by which the index exceeds the
strike price. Similarly, on exercise of an index put option contract, the holder receives
100 times the amount by which the strike price exceeds the index. Index options can be
used for portfolio insurance. If the value of the portfolio mirrors the index, it is
appropriate to buy one put option contract for each 100S0 dollars in the portfolio,
where S0 is the value of the index. If the portfolio does not mirror the index,  put
option contracts should be purchased for each 100S0 dollars in the portfolio, where  is
the beta of the portfolio calculated using the capital asset pricing model. The strike
price of the put options purchased should reﬂect the level of insurance required.
Most currency options are traded in the over-the-counter market. They can be used
by corporate treasurers to hedge a foreign exchange exposure. For example, a US
corporate treasurer who knows that the company will be receiving sterling at a certain
time in the future can hedge by buying put options that mature at that time. Similarly, a
US corporate treasurer who knows that the company will be paying sterling at a certain
time in the future can hedge by buying call options that mature at that time. Currency
options can also be used to create a range forward contract. This is a zero-cost contract
that can be used to provide downside protection while giving up some of the upside for
a company with a known foreign exchange exposure.
The Black–Scholes–Merton formula for valuing European options on a non-dividend-
paying stock can be extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known
dividend yield. The extension can be used to value European options on stock indices and
currencies because:
1. A stock index is analogous to a stock paying a dividend yield. The dividend yield
is the dividend yield on the stocks that make up the index.
2. A foreign currency is analogous to a stock paying a dividend yield. The foreign
risk-free interest rate plays the role of the dividend yield.
Binomial trees can be used to value American options on stock indices and currencies.

CHAPTER 17

Futures Options
The options we have considered so far provide the holder with the right to buy or sell a
certain asset by a certain date for a certain price. They are sometimes termed options on
spot or spot options because, when the options are exercised, the sale or purchase of the
asset at the agreed-on price takes place immediately. In this chapter we move on to
consider options on futures, also known as futures options. In these contracts, exercise of
the option gives the holder a position in a futures contract.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the US authorized the trading of
options on futures on an experimental basis in 1982. Permanent trading was approved
in 1987, and since then the popularity of the contract with investors has grown very fast.
In this chapter we consider how futures options work and the diﬀerences between
these options and spot options. We examine how futures options can be priced using
either binomial trees or formulas similar to those produced by Black, Scholes, and
Merton for stock options. We also explore the relative pricing of futures options and
spot options and examine what are known as futures-style options.
18.1
NATURE OF FUTURES OPTIONS
A futures option is the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a futures contract at a
certain futures price by a certain date. Speciﬁcally, a call futures option is the right to
enter into a long futures contract at a certain price; a put futures option is the right to
enter into a short futures contract at a certain price. Futures options are generally
American; that is, they can be exercised any time during the life of the contract.
If a call futures option is exercised, the holder acquires a long position in the
underlying futures contract plus a cash amount equal to the most recent settlement
futures price minus the strike price. If a put futures option is exercised, the holder
acquires a short position in the underlying futures contract plus a cash amount equal to
the strike price minus the most recent settlement futures price. As the following
examples show, the eﬀective payoﬀfrom a call futures option is maxðF  K; 0Þ and
the eﬀective payoﬀfrom a put futures option is maxðK  F; 0Þ, where F is the futures
price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Example 18.1
Suppose it is August 15 and an investor has one September futures call option
contract on copper with a strike price of 320 cents per pound. One futures
405
18
C H A P T E R

contract is on 25,000 pounds of copper. Suppose that the futures price of copper
for delivery in September is currently 331 cents, and at the close of trading on
August 14 (the last settlement) it was 330 cents. If the option is exercised, the
investor receives a cash amount of
25,000  ð330  320Þ cents ¼ $2,500
plus a long position in a futures contract to buy 25,000 pounds of copper in
September. If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out
immediately. This would leave the investor with the $2,500 cash payoﬀplus an
amount
25,000  ð331  330Þ cents ¼ $250
reﬂecting the change in the futures price since the last settlement. The total payoﬀ
from exercising the option on August 15 is $2,750, which equals 25,000ðF  KÞ,
where F is the futures price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Example 18.2
An investor has one December futures put option on corn with a strike price of
600 cents per bushel. One futures contract is on 5,000 bushels of corn. Suppose
that the current futures price of corn for delivery in December is 580, and the
most recent settlement price is 579 cents. If the option is exercised, the investor
receives a cash amount of
5,000  ð600  579Þ cents ¼ $1,050
plus a short position in a futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of corn in December.
If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out. This would leave
the investor with the $1,050 cash payoﬀminus an amount
5,000  ð580  579Þ cents ¼ $50
reﬂecting the change in the futures price since the last settlement. The net payoﬀ
from exercise is $1,000, which equals 5,000ðK  FÞ, where F is the futures price at
the time of exercise and K is the strike price.
Expiration Months
Futures options are referred to by the delivery month of the underlying futures contract
—not by the expiration month of the option. As mentioned earlier, most futures
options are American. The expiration date of a futures option contract is usually a
short period of time before the last trading day of the underlying futures contract. (For
example, the CME Group Treasury bond futures option expires on the latest Friday
that precedes by at least two business days the end of the month before the futures
delivery month.) An exception is the CME Group mid-curve Eurodollar contract where
the futures contract expires either one or two years after the options contract.
Popular contracts trading in the United States are those on corn, soybeans, cotton,
sugar-world, crude oil, natural gas, gold, Treasury bonds, Treasury notes, ﬁve-year
Treasury notes, 30-day federal funds, Eurodollars, one-year and two-year mid-curve
Eurodollars, Euribor, Eurobunds, and the S&P 500.

CHAPTER 18

Options on Interest Rate Futures
The most actively traded interest rate options oﬀered by exchanges in the United
States are those on Treasury bond futures, Treasury note futures, and Eurodollar
futures.
A Treasury bond futures option, which is traded by the CME Group, is an option to
enter a Treasury bond futures contract. As mentioned in Chapter 6, one Treasury bond
futures contract is for the delivery of $100,000 of Treasury bonds. The price of a
Treasury bond futures option is quoted as a percentage of the face value of the
underlying Treasury bonds to the nearest sixty-fourth of 1%.
An option on Eurodollar futures, which is traded by the CME Group, is an option to
enter into a Eurodollar futures contract. As explained in Chapter 6, when the Euro-
dollar futures quote changes by 1 basis point, or 0.01%, there is a gain or loss on a
Eurodollar futures contract of $25. Similarly, in the pricing of options on Eurodollar
futures, 1 basis point represents $25.
Interest rate futures option contracts work in the same way as the other futures
options contracts discussed in this chapter. For example, in addition to the cash
payoﬀ, the holder of a call option obtains a long position in the futures contract when
the option is exercised and the option writer obtains a corresponding short position.
The total payoﬀfrom the call, including the value of the futures position, is
maxðF  K; 0Þ, where F is the futures price at the time of exercise and K is the strike
price.
Interest rate futures prices increase when bond prices increase (i.e., when interest rates
fall). They decrease when bond prices decrease (i.e., when interest rates rise). An
investor who thinks that short-term interest rates will rise can speculate by buying
put options on Eurodollar futures, whereas an investor who thinks the rates will fall can
speculate by buying call options on Eurodollar futures. An investor who thinks that
long-term interest rates will rise can speculate by buying put options on Treasury note
futures or Treasury bond futures, whereas an investor who thinks the rates will fall can
speculate by buying call options on these instruments.
Example 18.3
It is February and the futures price for the June Eurodollar contract is 93.82
(corresponding to a 3-month Eurodollar interest rate of 6.18% per annum).
The price of a call option on the contract with a strike price of 94.00 is quoted
as 0.1, or 10 basis points. This option could be attractive to an investor who feels
that interest rates are likely to come down. Suppose that short-term interest rates
do drop by about 100 basis points and the investor exercises the call when the
Eurodollar futures price is 94.78 (corresponding to a 3-month Eurodollar interest
rate of 5.22% per annum). The payoﬀis 25  ð94:78  94:00Þ  100 ¼ $1,950.
The cost of the contract is 10  25 ¼ $250. The investor’s proﬁt is therefore
$1,700.
Example 18.4
It is August and the futures price for the December Treasury bond contract is
96-09 (or 96 9
32 ¼ 96:28125). The yield on long-term government bonds is about
6.4% per annum. An investor who feels that this yield will fall by December
might choose to buy December calls with a strike price of 98. Assume that the
price of these calls is 1-04 (or 1 4
64 ¼ 1:0625% of the principal). If long-term rates
Futures Options
407

fall to 6% per annum and the Treasury bond futures price rises to 100-00, the
investor will make a net proﬁt per $100 of bond futures of
100:00  98:00  1:0625 ¼ 0:9375
Since one option contract is for the purchase or sale of instruments with a face
value of $100,000, the investor’s proﬁt is $937.50 per option contract bought.
18.2
REASONS FOR THE POPULARITY OF FUTURES OPTIONS
It is natural to ask why people choose to trade options on futures rather than options on
the underlying asset. The main reason appears to be that a futures contract is, in many
circumstances, more liquid and easier to trade than the underlying asset. Furthermore, a
futures price is known immediately from trading on the futures exchange, whereas the
spot price of the underlying asset may not be so readily available.
Consider Treasury bonds. The market for Treasury bond futures is much more active
than the market for any particular Treasury bond. Also, a Treasury bond futures price
is known immediately from exchange trading. By contrast, the current market price of a
bond can be obtained only by contacting one or more dealers. It is not surprising that
investors would rather take delivery of a Treasury bond futures contract than Treasury
bonds.
Futures on commodities are also often easier to trade than the commodities
themselves. For example, it is much easier and more convenient to make or take
delivery of a live-cattle futures contract than it is to make or take delivery of the cattle
themselves.
An important point about a futures option is that exercising it does not usually lead
to delivery of the underlying asset, as in most circumstances the underlying futures
contract is closed out prior to delivery. Futures options are therefore normally even-
tually settled in cash. This is appealing to many investors, particularly those with
limited capital who may ﬁnd it diﬃcult to come up with the funds to buy the underlying
asset when an option on spot is exercised. Another advantage sometimes cited for
futures options is that futures and futures options are traded side by side in the same
exchange. This facilitates hedging, arbitrage, and speculation. It also tends to make the
markets more eﬃcient. A ﬁnal point is that futures options entail lower transaction
costs than spot options in many situations.
18.3
EUROPEAN SPOT AND FUTURES OPTIONS
The payoﬀfrom a European call option with strike price K on the spot price of an
asset is
maxðST  K; 0Þ
where ST is the spot price at the option’s maturity. The payoﬀfrom a European call
option with the same strike price on the futures price of the asset is
maxðFT  K; 0Þ
where FT is the futures price at the option’s maturity. If the futures contract matures at
408
CHAPTER 18

the same time as the option, then FT ¼ ST and the two options are equivalent.
Similarly, a European futures put option is worth the same as its spot put option
counterpart when the futures contract matures at the same time as the option.
Most of the futures options that trade are American-style. However, as we shall see, it
is useful to study European futures options because the results that are obtained can be
used to value the corresponding European spot options.
18.4
PUT–CALL PARITY
In Chapter 11, we derived a put–call parity relationship for European stock options.
We now consider a similar argument to derive a put–call parity relationship for
European futures options. Consider European call and put futures options, both with
strike price K and time to expiration T. We can form two portfolios:
Portfolio A : a European call futures option plus an amount of cash equal to KerT
Portfolio B : a European put futures option plus a long futures contract plus an
amount of cash equal to F0erT, where F0 is the futures price
In portfolio A, the cash can be invested at the risk-free rate, r, and grows to K at time T.
Let FT be the futures price at maturity of the option. If FT > K, the call option in
portfolio A is exercised and portfolio A is worth FT. If FT 6 K, the call is not exercised
and portfolio A is worth K. The value of portfolio A at time T is therefore
maxðFT; KÞ
In portfolio B, the cash can be invested at the risk-free rate to grow to F0 at time T. The
put option provides a payoﬀof maxðK  FT; 0Þ. The futures contract provides a payoﬀ
of FT  F0.1 The value of portfolio B at time T is therefore
F0 þ ðFT  F0Þ þ maxðK  FT; 0Þ ¼ maxðFT; KÞ
Because the two portfolios have the same value at time T and European options cannot
be exercised early, it follows that they are worth the same today. The value of portfolio A
today is
c þ KerT
where c is the price of the call futures option. The daily settlement process ensures that the
futures contract in portfolio B is worth zero today. Portfolio B is therefore worth
p þ F0erT
where p is the price of the put futures option. Hence
c þ KerT ¼ p þ F0erT
ð18:1Þ
The diﬀerence between this put–call parity relationship and the one for a non-
dividend-paying stock in equation (11.6) is that the stock price, S0, is replaced by
the discounted futures price, F0erT.
1 This analysis assumes that a futures contract is like a forward contract and settled at the end of its life
rather than on a day-to-day basis.
Futures Options
409

As shown in Section 18.3, when the underlying futures contract matures at the same
time as the option, European futures and spot options are the same. Equation (18.1)
therefore gives a relationship between the price of a call option on the spot price, the
price of a put option on the spot price, and the futures price when both options mature
at the same time as the futures contract.
Example 18.5
Suppose that the price of a European call option on spot silver for delivery in six
months is $0.56 per ounce when the exercise price is $8.50. Assume that the silver
futures price for delivery in six months is currently $8.00, and the risk-free interest
rate for an investment that matures in six months is 10% per annum. From a
rearrangement of equation (18.1), the price of a European put option on spot
silver with the same maturity and exercise date as the call option is
0:56 þ 8:50e0:16=12  8:00e0:16=12 ¼ 1:04
For American futures options, the put–call relationship is (see Problem 18.19)
F0erT  K < C  P < F0  KerT
ð18:2Þ
18.5
BOUNDS FOR FUTURES OPTIONS
The put–call parity relationship in equation (18.1) provides bounds for European call
and put options. Because the price of a put, p, cannot be negative, it follows from
equation (18.1) that
c þ KerT > F0erT
so that
c > max

ðF0  KÞerT; 0

ð18:3Þ
Similarly, because the price of a call option cannot be negative, it follows from equa-
tion (18.1) that
KerT 6 F0erT þ p
so that
p > max

ðK  F0ÞerT; 0

ð18:4Þ
These bounds are similar to the ones derived for European stock options in Chapter 11.
The prices of European call and put options are very close to their lower bounds when
the options are deep in the money. To see why this is so, we return to the put–call parity
relationship in equation (18.1). When a call option is deep in the money, the corres-
ponding put option is deep out of the money. This means that p is very close to zero. The
diﬀerence between c and its lower bound equals p, so that the price of the call option
must be very close to its lower bound. A similar argument applies to put options.
Because American futures options can be exercised at any time, we must have
C > maxðF0  K; 0Þ
and
P > maxðK  F0; 0Þ
Thus, assuming interest rates are positive, the lower bound for an American option
410
CHAPTER 18

price is always higher than the lower bound for the corresponding European option
price. There is always some chance that an American futures option will be exercised
early.
18.6
VALUATION OF FUTURES OPTIONS USING BINOMIAL TREES
This section examines, more formally than in Chapter 13, how binomial trees can be
used to price futures options. A key diﬀerence between futures options and stock
options is that there are no up-front costs when a futures contract is entered into.
Suppose that the current futures price is 30 and that it will move either up to 33 or
down to 28 over the next month. We consider a one-month call option on the futures
with a strike price of 29 and ignore daily settlement. The situation is as indicated in
Figure 18.1. If the futures price proves to be 33, the payoﬀfrom the option is 4 and the
value of the futures contract is 3. If the futures price proves to be 28, the payoﬀfrom the
option is zero and the value of the futures contract is 2.2
To set up a riskless hedge, we consider a portfolio consisting of a short position in
one options contract and a long position in  futures contracts. If the futures price
moves up to 33, the value of the portfolio is 3  4; if it moves down to 28, the value
of the portfolio is 2. The portfolio is riskless when these are the same, that is,
when
3  4 ¼ 2
or  ¼ 0:8.
For this value of , we know the portfolio will be worth 3  0:8  4 ¼ 1:6 in one
month. Assume a risk-free interest rate of 6%. The value of the portfolio today
must be
1:6e0:061=12 ¼ 1:592
The portfolio consists of one short option and  futures contracts. Because the value of
the futures contract today is zero, the value of the option today must be 1.592.

2 There is an approximation here in that the gain or loss on the futures contract is not realized at time T. It is
realized day by day between time 0 and time T. However, as the length of the time step in a multistep
binomial tree becomes shorter, the approximation becomes better.

A Generalization
We can generalize this analysis by considering a futures price that starts at F0 and is
anticipated to rise to F0u or move down to F0d over the time period T. We consider an
option maturing at time T and suppose that its payoﬀis fu if the futures price moves up
and fd if it moves down. The situation is summarized in Figure 18.2.
The riskless portfolio in this case consists of a short position in one option combined
with a long position in  futures contracts, where
 ¼
fu  fd
F0u  F0d
The value of the portfolio at time T is then always
ðF0u  F0Þ  fu
Denoting the risk-free interest rate by r, we obtain the value of the portfolio today as
½ðF0u  F0Þ  fuerT
Another expression for the present value of the portfolio is f, where f is the value of
the option today. It follows that
f ¼ ½ðF0u  F0Þ  fuerT
Substituting for  and simplifying reduces this equation to
f ¼ erT½pfu þ ð1  pÞfd
ð18:5Þ
where
p ¼ 1  d
u  d
ð18:6Þ
This agrees with the result in Section 13.9. Equation (18.6) gives the risk-neutral
probability of an up movement.
In the numerical
example considered previously
(see
Figure 18.1),
u ¼ 1:1,

This result agrees with the answer obtained for this example earlier.
Multistep Trees
Multistep binomial trees are used to value American-style futures options in much the
same way that they are used to value options on stocks. This is explained in Section 13.9.
The parameter u deﬁning up movements in the futures price is e ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
, where  is the
volatility of the futures price and t is the length of one time step. The probability of an
up movement in the future price is that in equation (18.6):
p ¼ 1  d
u  d
Example 13.3 illustrates the use of multistep binomial trees for valuing a futures option.
Example 21.3 in Chapter 21 provides a further illustration.
18.7
DRIFT OF A FUTURES PRICE IN A RISK-NEUTRAL WORLD
There is a general result that allows us to use the analysis in Section 17.3 for futures
options. This result is that in a risk-neutral world a futures price behaves in the same
way as a stock paying a dividend yield at the domestic risk-free interest rate r.
One clue that this might be so is given by noting that the equation for the probability p
in a binomial tree for a futures price is the same as that for a stock paying a dividend yield
equal to q when q ¼ r (compare equation (18.6) with equations (17.15) and (17.16)).
Another clue is that the put–call parity relationship for futures options prices is the same
as that for options on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate q when the stock price is
replaced by the futures price and q ¼ r (compare equations (18.1) and (17.3)).
To prove the result formally, we calculate the drift of a futures price in a risk-neutral
world. We deﬁne Ft as the futures price at time t and suppose the settlement dates to be
at times 0, t, 2t, . . . If we enter into a long futures contract at time 0, its value is
zero. At time t, it provides a payoﬀof Ft  F0. If r is the very-short-term (t-period)
interest rate at time 0, risk-neutral valuation gives the value of the contract at time 0 as
ert ^E½Ft  F0
where ^E denotes expectations in a risk-neutral world. We must therefore have
ert ^EðFt  F0Þ ¼ 0
showing that
^EðFtÞ ¼ F0
Similarly,
^EðF2tÞ ¼ Ft,
^EðF3tÞ ¼ F2t, and so on. Putting many results like this
together, we see that
^EðFTÞ ¼ F0
for any time T.
Futures Options
413

The drift of the futures price in a risk-neutral world is therefore zero. From equa-
tion (17.7), the futures price behaves like a stock providing a dividend yield q equal to r.
This result is a very general one. It is true for all futures prices and does not depend on
any assumptions about interest rates, volatilities, etc.3
The usual assumption made for the process followed by a futures price F in the risk-
neutral world is
dF ¼ F dz
ð18:7Þ
where  is a constant.
Differential Equation
For another way of seeing that a futures price behaves like a stock paying a dividend
yield at rate q, we can derive the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by a derivative dependent
on a futures price in the same way as we derived the diﬀerential equation for a derivative
dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 15.6. This is4

It has the same form as equation (17.6) with q set equal to r. This conﬁrms that, for the
purpose of valuing derivatives, a futures price can be treated in the same way as a stock
providing a dividend yield at rate r.

BLACK’S MODEL FOR VALUING FUTURES OPTIONS
European futures options can be valued by extending the results we have produced.
Fischer Black was the ﬁrst to show this in a paper published in 1976.5 Assuming that
the futures price follows the (lognormal) process in equation (18.7), the European call
price c and the European put price p for a futures option are given by equations (17.4)
and (17.5) with S0 replaced by F0 and q ¼ r:

3 As we will discover in Chapter 28, a more precise statement of the result is: ‘‘A futures price has zero drift in
the traditional risk-neutral world where the numeraire is the money market account.’’ A zero-drift stochastic
process is known as a martingale. A forward price is a martingale in a diﬀerent risk-neutral world. This is one
where the numeraire is a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T.

the same as the volatility of the underlying asset.
Example 18.6
Consider a European put futures option on a commodity. The time to the option’s
maturity is 4 months, the current futures price is $20, the exercise price is $20, the
risk-free interest rate is 9% per annum, and the volatility of the futures price is 25%
per annum. In this case, F0 ¼ 20, K ¼ 20, r ¼ 0:09, T ¼ 4=12,  ¼ 0:25, and

Using Black’s Model Instead of Black–Scholes–Merton
The results in Section 18.3 show that European futures options and European spot
options are equivalent when the option contract matures at the same time as the futures
contract. Equations (18.9) and (18.10) therefore provide a way of calculating the value
of European options on the spot price of a asset.
Example 18.7
Consider a six-month European call option on the spot price of gold, that is, an
option to buy one ounce of gold in the spot market in six months. The strike price
is $1,200, the six-month futures price of gold is $1,240, the risk-free rate of interest
is 5% per annum, and the volatility of the futures price is 20%. The option is the
same as a six-month European option on the six-month futures price. The value
of the option is therefore given by equation (18.9) as
e0:050:5½1,240Nðd1Þ  1,200Nðd2Þ

It is $88.37.
Traders like to use Black’s model rather than Black–Scholes–Merton to value Euro-
pean spot options. It has a fairly general applicability. The underlying asset can be a
consumption or investment asset and it can provide income to the holder. The variable
F0 in equations (18.9) and (18.10) is set equal to either the futures or the forward price
of the underlying asset for a contract maturing at the same time as the option.
Futures Options
415

Equations (17.13) and (17.14) show Black’s model being used to value European
options on the spot value of a currency. Equations (17.8) and (17.9) show Black’s model
being used to value European options on the spot value of an index. The big advantage
of Black’s model is that it avoids the need to estimate the income (or convenience yield)
on the underlying asset. The futures or forward price that is used in the model
incorporate the market’s estimate of this income.
When considering stock indices in Section 17.4, we explained that put–call parity is
used to imply the forward prices for maturities for which there are actively traded
options. Interpolation is then used to estimate forward prices for other maturities. The
same approach can be used for a wide range of other underlying assets.
18.9
AMERICAN FUTURES OPTIONS vs. AMERICAN SPOT OPTIONS
Traded futures options are in practice usually American. Assuming that the risk-free
rate of interest, r, is positive, there is always some chance that it will be optimal to
exercise an American futures option early. American futures options are therefore
worth more than their European counterparts.
It is not generally true that an American futures option is worth the same as the
corresponding American spot option when the futures and options contracts have the
same maturity.6 Suppose, for example, that there is a normal market with futures prices
consistently higher than spot prices prior to maturity. An American call futures option
must be worth more than the corresponding American spot call option. The reason is
that in some situations the futures option will be exercised early, in which case it will
provide a greater proﬁt to the holder. Similarly, an American put futures option must
be worth less than the corresponding American spot put option. If there is an inverted
market with futures prices consistently lower than spot prices, the reverse must be true.
American call futures options are worth less than the corresponding American spot call
option, whereas American put futures options are worth more than the corresponding
American spot put option.
The diﬀerences just described between American futures options and American spot
options hold true when the futures contract expires later than the options contract as
well as when the two expire at the same time. In fact, the later the futures contract
expires the greater the diﬀerences tend to be.
18.10
FUTURES-STYLE OPTIONS
Some exchanges, particularly those in Europe, trade what are termed futures-style
options. These are futures contracts on the payoﬀfrom an option. Normally a trader
who buys (sells) an option, whether on the spot price of an asset or on the futures price
of an asset, pays (receives) cash up front. By contrast, traders who buy or sell a futures-
style option post margin in the same way that they do on a regular futures contract (see
Chapter 2). The contract is settled daily as with any other futures contract and the ﬁnal
settlement price is the payoﬀfrom the option. Just as a futures contract is a bet on what
6 The spot option ‘‘corresponding’’ to a futures option is deﬁned here as one with the same strike price and
the same expiration date.
416
CHAPTER 18

the future price of an asset will be, a futures-style option is a bet on what the payoﬀ
from an option will be.7 If interest rates are constant, the futures price in a futures-style
option is the same as the forward price in a forward contract on the option payoﬀ. This
shows that the futures price for a futures-style option is the price that would be paid for
the option if payment were made in arrears. It is therefore the value of a regular option
compounded forward at the risk-free rate.
Black’s model in equations (18.9) and (18.10) gives the price of a regular European
option on an asset in terms of the futures (or forward) price F0 for a contract maturing
at the same time as the option. The futures price in a call futures-style option is
therefore
F0Nðd1Þ  KNðd2Þ
and the futures price in a put futures-style option is
KNðd2Þ  F0Nðd1Þ
where d1 and d2 are as deﬁned in equations (18.9) and (18.10). These formulas do not
depend on the level of interest rates. They are correct for a futures-style option on a
futures contract and a futures-style option on the spot value of an asset. In the ﬁrst
case, F0 is the current futures price for the contract underlying the option; in the second
case, it is the current futures price for a futures contract on the underlying asset
maturing at the same time as the option.
The put–call parity relationship for a futures-style options is
p þ F0 ¼ c þ K
An American futures-style option can be exercised early, in which case there is an
immediate ﬁnal settlement at the option’s intrinsic value. As it turns out, it is never
optimal to exercise an American futures-style options on a futures contract early
because the futures price of the option is always greater than the intrinsic value. This
type of American futures-style option can therefore be treated as though it were the
corresponding European futures-style option.
SUMMARY
Futures options require delivery of the underlying futures contract on exercise. When a
call is exercised, the holder acquires a long futures position plus a cash amount equal to
the excess of the futures price over the strike price. Similarly, when a put is exercised the
holder acquires a short position plus a cash amount equal to the excess of the strike
price over the futures price. The futures contract that is delivered usually expires slightly
later than the option.
A futures price behaves in the same way as a stock that provides a dividend yield
equal to the risk-free rate, r. This means that the results produced in Chapter 17 for
options on a stock paying a dividend yield apply to futures options if we replace the
stock price by the futures price and set the dividend yield equal to the risk-free interest

Margining,’’ Journal of Futures Markets, 10, 4 (1990), 327–38. For pricing when interest rates are stochastic,

rate. Pricing formulas for European futures options were ﬁrst produced by Fischer
Black in 1976. They assume that the futures price is lognormally distributed at the
option’s expiration.
If the expiration dates for the option and futures contracts are the same, a European
futures option is worth exactly the same as the corresponding European spot option.
This result is often used to value European spot options. The result is not true for
American options. If the futures market is normal, an American call futures is worth
more than the corresponding American spot call option, while an American put futures
is worth less than the corresponding American spot put option. If the futures market is
inverted, the reverse is true.

CHAPTER 18

The Greek Letters
A ﬁnancial institution that sells an option to a client in the over-the-counter markets is
faced with the problem of managing its risk. If the option happens to be the same as
one that is traded on an exchange, the ﬁnancial institution can neutralize its exposure by
buying on the exchange the same option as it has sold. But when the option has been
tailored to the needs of a client and does not correspond to the standardized products
traded by exchanges, hedging the exposure is far more diﬃcult.
In this chapter we discuss some of the alternative approaches to this problem. We
cover what are commonly referred to as the ‘‘Greek letters’’, or simply the ‘‘Greeks’’.
Each Greek letter measures a diﬀerent dimension to the risk in an option position and
the aim of a trader is to manage the Greeks so that all risks are acceptable. The analysis
presented in this chapter is applicable to market makers in options on an exchange as
well as to traders working in the over-the-counter market for ﬁnancial institutions.
Toward the end of the chapter, we will consider the creation of options synthetically.
This turns out to be very closely related to the hedging of options. Creating an option
position synthetically is essentially the same task as hedging the opposite option
position. For example, creating a long call option synthetically is the same as hedging
a short position in the call option.
19.1
ILLUSTRATION
In the next few sections we use as an example the position of a ﬁnancial institution that
has sold for $300,000 a European call option on 100,000 shares of a non-dividend-
paying stock. We assume that the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free
interest rate is 5% per annum, the stock price volatility is 20% per annum, the time to
maturity is 20 weeks (0.3846 years), and the expected return from the stock is 13% per
annum.1 With our usual notation, this means that
S0 ¼ 49;
K ¼ 50;
r ¼ 0:05;
 ¼ 0:20;
T ¼ 0:3846;
 ¼ 0:13
The Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option is about $240,000. (This is because the
1 As shown in Chapters 13 and 15, the expected return is irrelevant to the pricing of an option. It is given here
because it can have some bearing on the eﬀectiveness of a hedging scheme.
421
19
C H A P T E R

value of an option to buy one share is $2.40.) The ﬁnancial institution has therefore
sold a product for $60,000 more than its theoretical value. But it is faced with the
problem of hedging the risks.2
19.2
NAKED AND COVERED POSITIONS
One strategy open to the ﬁnancial institution is to do nothing. This is sometimes referred
to as a naked position. It is a strategy that works well if the stock price is below $50 at the
end of the 20 weeks. The option then costs the ﬁnancial institution nothing and it makes
a proﬁt of $300,000. A naked position works less well if the call is exercised because the
ﬁnancial institution then has to buy 100,000 shares at the market price prevailing in 20
weeks to cover the call. The cost to the ﬁnancial institution is 100,000 times the amount
by which the stock price exceeds the strike price. For example, if after 20 weeks the stock
price is $60, the option costs the ﬁnancial institution $1,000,000. This is considerably
greater than the $300,000 charged for the option.
As an alternative to a naked position, the ﬁnancial institution can adopt a covered
position. This involves buying 100,000 shares as soon as the option has been sold. If the
option is exercised, this strategy works well, but in other circumstances it could lead to a
signiﬁcant loss. For example, if the stock price drops to $40, the ﬁnancial institution
loses $900,000 on its stock position. This is considerably greater than the $300,000
charged for the option.3
Neither a naked position nor a covered position provides a good hedge. If the
assumptions underlying the Black–Scholes–Merton formula hold, the cost to the
ﬁnancial institution should always be $240,000 on average for both approaches.4 But
on any one occasion the cost is liable to range from zero to over $1,000,000. A good
hedge would ensure that the cost is always close to $240,000.
19.3
A STOP-LOSS STRATEGY
One interesting hedging procedure that is sometimes proposed involves a stop-loss
strategy. To illustrate the basic idea, consider an institution that has written a call option
with strike price K to buy one unit of a stock. The hedging procedure involves buying one
unit of the stock as soon as its price rises above K and selling it as soon as its price falls
below K. The objective is to hold a naked position whenever the stock price is less than K
and a covered position whenever the stock price is greater than K. The procedure is
designed to ensure that at time T the institution owns the stock if the option closes in the
money and does not own it if the option closes out of the money. In the situation
illustrated in Figure 19.1, it involves buying the stock at time t1, selling it at time t2,
buying it at time t3, selling it at time t4, buying it at time t5, and delivering it at time T.
2 A call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is a convenient example with which to develop our ideas. The
points that will be made apply to other types of options and to other derivatives.
3 Put–call parity shows that the exposure from writing a covered call is the same as the exposure from writing
a naked put.
4 More precisely, the present value of the expected cost is $240,000 for both approaches assuming that
appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates are used.

CHAPTER 19

As usual, we denote the initial stock price by S0. The cost of setting up the hedge
initially is S0 if S0 > K and zero otherwise. It seems as though the total cost, Q, of
writing and hedging the option is the option’s initial intrinsic value:
Q ¼ maxðS0  K; 0Þ
ð19:1Þ
This is because all purchases and sales subsequent to time 0 are made at price K. If this
were in fact correct, the hedging procedure would work perfectly in the absence of
transaction costs. Furthermore, the cost of hedging the option would always be less
than its Black–Scholes–Merton price. Thus, an investor could earn riskless proﬁts by
writing options and hedging them.
There are two key reasons why equation (19.1) is incorrect. The ﬁrst is that the cash
ﬂows to the hedger occur at diﬀerent times and must be discounted. The second is that
purchases and sales cannot be made at exactly the same price K. This second point is
critical. If we assume a risk-neutral world with zero interest rates, we can justify
ignoring the time value of money. But we cannot legitimately assume that both
purchases and sales are made at the same price. If markets are eﬃcient, the hedger
cannot know whether, when the stock price equals K, it will continue above or below K.
As a practical matter, purchases must be made at a price K þ  and sales must be
made at a price K  , for some small positive number . Thus, every purchase and
subsequent sale involves a cost (apart from transaction costs) of 2. A natural response
on the part of the hedger is to monitor price movements more closely, so that  is
reduced. Assuming that stock prices change continuously,  can be made arbitrarily
small by monitoring the stock prices closely. But as  is made smaller, trades tend to
occur more frequently. Thus, the lower cost per trade is oﬀset by the increased
frequency of trading. As  ! 0, the expected number of trades tends to inﬁnity.5

A stop-loss strategy, although superﬁcially attractive, does not work particularly well
as a hedging procedure. Consider its use for an out-of-the-money option. If the stock
price never reaches the strike price K, the hedging procedure costs nothing. If the path of
the stock price crosses the strike price level many times, the procedure is quite expensive.
Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess the overall performance of stop-loss
hedging. This involves randomly sampling paths for the stock price and observing the
results of using the procedure. Table 19.1 shows the results for the option considered in
Section 19.1. It assumes that the stock price is observed at the end of time intervals of
length t.6 The hedge performance measure in Table 19.1 is the ratio of the standard
deviation of the cost of hedging the option to the Black–Scholes–Merton price. (The
cost of hedging was calculated as the cumulative cost excluding the impact of interest
payments and discounting.) Each result is based on one million sample paths for the
stock price. An eﬀective hedging scheme should have a hedge performance measure
close to zero. In this case, it seems to stay above 0.7 regardless of how small t is. This
emphasizes that the stop-loss strategy is not a good hedging procedure.
19.4
DELTA HEDGING
Most traders use more sophisticated hedging procedures than those mentioned so far.
These involve calculating measures such as delta, gamma, and vega. In this section we
consider the role played by delta.
The delta () of an option was introduced in Chapter 13. It is deﬁned as the rate of
change of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying asset. It is the
slope of the curve that relates the option price to the underlying asset price. Suppose
that the delta of a call option on a stock is 0.6. This means that when the stock price
changes by a small amount, the option price changes by about 60% of that amount.
Figure 19.2 shows the relationship between a call price and the underlying stock price.
When the stock price corresponds to point A, the option price corresponds to point B,
and  is the slope of the line indicated. In general,
 ¼ @c
@S
where c is the price of the call option and S is the stock price.
Suppose that, in Figure 19.2, the stock price is $100 and the option price is $10.
Imagine an investor who has sold call options to buy 2,000 shares of a stock (i.e., he or

6 The precise hedging rule used was as follows. If the stock price moves from below K to above K in a time
interval of length t, it is bought at the end of the interval. If it moves from above K to below K in the time
interval, it is sold at the end of the interval; otherwise, no action is taken.

CHAPTER 19

she has sold 20 call option contracts). The investor’s position could be hedged by
buying 0:6  2,000 ¼ 1,200 shares. The gain (loss) on the stock position would then
tend to oﬀset the loss (gain) on the option position. For example, if the stock price
goes up by $1 (producing a gain of $1,200 on the shares purchased), the option price
will tend to go up by 0:6  $1 ¼ $0:60 (producing a loss of $1,200 on the options
written); if the stock price goes down by $1 (producing a loss of $1,200 on the shares
purchased), the option price will tend to go down by $0.60 (producing a gain of $1,200
on the options written).
In this example, the delta of the trader’s short position in 2,000 options is
0:6  ð2,000Þ ¼ 1,200
This means that the trader loses 1,200S on the option position when the stock price
increases by S. The delta of one share of the stock is 1.0, so that the long position in
1,200 shares has a delta of þ1,200. The delta of the trader’s overall position is,
therefore, zero. The delta of the stock position oﬀsets the delta of the option position.
A position with a delta of zero is referred to as delta neutral.
It is important to realize that, since the delta of an option does not remain constant,
the trader’s position remains delta hedged (or delta neutral) for only a relatively short
period of time. The hedge has to be adjusted periodically. This is known as rebalancing.
In our example, by the end of 1 day the stock price might have increased to $110. As
indicated by Figure 19.2, an increase in the stock price leads to an increase in delta.
Suppose that delta rises from 0.60 to 0.65. An extra 0:05  2,000 ¼ 100 shares would
then have to be purchased to maintain the hedge. A procedure such as this, where the
hedge is adjusted on a regular basis, is referred to as dynamic hedging. It can be
contrasted with static hedging, where a hedge is set up initially and never adjusted.
Static hedging is sometimes also referred to as ‘‘hedge-and-forget.’’
Delta is closely related to the Black–Scholes–Merton analysis. As explained in
Chapter 15, the Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation can be derived by setting
up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in an option on a stock and a position in

the stock. Expressed in terms of , the portfolio is
1: option
þ: shares of the stock.
Using our new terminology, we can say that options can be valued by setting up a delta-
neutral position and arguing that the return on the position should (instantaneously) be
the risk-free interest rate.
Delta of European Stock Options
For a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock, it can be shown (see
Problem 15.17) that
ðcallÞ ¼ Nðd1Þ
where d1 is deﬁned as in equation (15.20) and NðxÞ is the cumulative distribution
function for a standard normal distribution. The formula gives the delta of a long
position in one call option. The delta of a short position in one call option is Nðd1Þ.
Using delta hedging for a short position in a European call option involves maintaining
a long position of Nðd1Þ for each option sold. Similarly, using delta hedging for a long
position in a European call option involves maintaining a short position of Nðd1Þ shares
for each option purchased.
For a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, delta is given by
ðputÞ ¼ Nðd1Þ  1
Delta is negative, which means that a long position in a put option should be hedged
with a long position in the underlying stock, and a short position in a put option
should be hedged with a short position in the underlying stock. Figure 19.3 shows the
variation of the delta of a call option and a put option with the stock price. Figure 19.4
shows the variation of delta with the time to maturity for in-the-money, at-the-money,
and out-of-the-money call options.

CHAPTER 19

Example 19.1
Consider again the call option on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 19.1
where the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the
time to maturity is 20 weeks (¼ 0:3846 years), and the volatility is 20%. In this case,

Delta is Nðd1Þ, or 0.522. When the stock price changes by S, the option price
changes by 0:522S.
Dynamic Aspects of Delta Hedging
Tables 19.2 and 19.3 provide two examples of the operation of delta hedging for the
example in Section 19.1, where 100,000 call options are sold. The hedge is assumed to
be adjusted or rebalanced weekly. The initial value of delta for a single option is
calculated in Example 19.1 as 0.522. This means that the delta of the option position
is initially 100,000  0:522, or 52,200. As soon as the option is written, $2,557,800
must be borrowed to buy 52,200 shares at a price of $49 to create a delta-neutral
position. The rate of interest is 5%. An interest cost of approximately $2,500 is therefore
incurred in the ﬁrst week.
In Table 19.2, the stock price falls by the end of the ﬁrst week to $48.12. The delta of
the option declines to 0.458, so that the new delta of the option position is 45,800.
This means that 6,400 of the shares initially purchased are sold to maintain the delta-
neutral hedge. The strategy realizes $308,000 in cash, and the cumulative borrowings at
the end of Week 1 are reduced to $2,252,300. During the second week, the stock price

reduces to $47.37, delta declines again, and so on. Toward the end of the life of the
option, it becomes apparent that the option will be exercised and the delta of the option
approaches 1.0. By Week 20, therefore, the hedger has a fully covered position. The
hedger receives $5 million for the stock held, so that the total cost of writing the option
and hedging it is $263,300.
Table 19.3 illustrates an alternative sequence of events such that the option closes out
of the money. As it becomes clear that the option will not be exercised, delta
approaches zero. By Week 20 the hedger has a naked position and has incurred costs
totaling $256,600.
In Tables 19.2 and 19.3, the costs of hedging the option, when discounted to the
beginning of the period, are close to but not exactly the same as the Black–Scholes–
Merton price of $240,000. If the hedging worked perfectly, the cost of hedging would,
after discounting, be exactly equal to the Black–Scholes–Merton price for every
simulated stock price path. The reason for the variation in the cost of hedging is that
the hedge is rebalanced only once a week. As rebalancing takes place more frequently,
the variation in the cost of hedging is reduced. Of course, the examples in Tables 19.2
and 19.3 are idealized in that they assume that the volatility is constant and there are no
transaction costs.

CHAPTER 19

Table 19.4 shows statistics on the performance of delta hedging obtained from one
million random stock price paths in our example. The performance measure is calculated
similarly to Table 19.1 as the ratio of the standard deviation of the cost of hedging the
option to the Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option. It is clear that delta hedging is a
great improvement over a stop-loss strategy. Unlike a stop-loss strategy, the performance
of a delta-hedging strategy gets steadily better as the hedge is monitored more frequently.

Delta hedging aims to keep the value of the ﬁnancial institution’s position as close to
unchanged as possible. Initially, the value of the written option is $240,000. In the
situation depicted in Table 19.2, the value of the option can be calculated as $414,500 in
Week 9. Thus, the ﬁnancial institution has lost $174,500 on its short option position. Its
cash position, as measured by the cumulative cost, is $1,442,900 worse in Week 9 than
in Week 0. The value of the shares held has increased from $2,557,800 to $4,171,100.
The net eﬀect of all this is that the value of the ﬁnancial institution’s position has
changed by only $4,100 between Week 0 and Week 9.
Where the Cost Comes From
The delta-hedging procedure in Tables 19.2 and 19.3 creates the equivalent of a long
position in the option. This neutralizes the short position the ﬁnancial institution
created by writing the option. As the tables illustrate, delta hedging a short position
generally involves selling stock just after the price has gone down and buying stock just
after the price has gone up. It might be termed a buy-high, sell-low trading strategy!
The average cost of $240,000 comes from the present value of the diﬀerence between the
price at which stock is purchased and the price at which it is sold.
Delta of a Portfolio
The delta of a portfolio of options or other derivatives dependent on a single asset
whose price is S is
@
@S
where  is the value of the portfolio.
The delta of the portfolio can be calculated from the deltas of the individual options
in the portfolio. If a portfolio consists of a quantity wi of option i (1 6 i 6 n), the delta
of the portfolio is given by
 ¼
X
n
i¼1
wi i
where i is the delta of the ith option. The formula can be used to calculate the
position in the underlying asset necessary to make the delta of the portfolio zero. When
this position has been taken, the portfolio is referred to as being delta neutral.
Suppose a ﬁnancial institution has the following three positions in options on a
stock:
1. A long position in 100,000 call options with strike price $55 and an expiration date
in 3 months. The delta of each option is 0.533.
2. A short position in 200,000 call options with strike price $56 and an expiration
date in 5 months. The delta of each option is 0.468.
3. A short position in 50,000 put options with strike price $56 and an expiration date
in 2 months. The delta of each option is 0:508.
The delta of the whole portfolio is
100,000  0:533  200,000  0:468  50,000  ð0:508Þ ¼ 14,900
This means that the portfolio can be made delta neutral by buying 14,900 shares.
430
CHAPTER 19

Transaction Costs
Derivatives dealers usually rebalance their positions once a day to maintain delta
neutrality. When the dealer has a small number of options on a particular asset, this is
liable to be prohibitively expensive because of the bid–oﬀer spreads the dealer is subject
to on trades. For a large portfolio of options, it is more feasible. Only one trade in the
underlying asset is necessary to zero out delta for the whole portfolio. The bid–oﬀer
spread transaction costs are absorbed by the proﬁts on many diﬀerent trades.
19.5
THETA
The theta () of a portfolio of options is the rate of change of the value of the portfolio
with respect to the passage of time with all else remaining the same. Theta is sometimes
referred to as the time decay of the portfolio. For a European call option on a non-
dividend-paying stock, it can be shown from the Black–Scholes–Merton formula (see
Problem 15.17) that
ðcallÞ ¼  S0N 0ðd1Þ

Because Nðd2Þ ¼ 1  Nðd2Þ, the theta of a put exceeds the theta of the corresponding
call by rKerT.
In these formulas, time is measured in years. Usually, when theta is quoted, time is
measured in days, so that theta is the change in the portfolio value when 1 day passes
with all else remaining the same. We can measure theta either ‘‘per calendar day’’ or
‘‘per trading day’’. To obtain the theta per calendar day, the formula for theta must be
divided by 365; to obtain theta per trading day, it must be divided by 252. (DerivaGem
measures theta per calendar day.)
Example 19.2
As in Example 19.1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to
maturity is 20 weeks (¼ 0:3846 years), and the volatility is 20%. In this case,
S0 ¼ 49, K ¼ 50, r ¼ 0:05,  ¼ 0:2, and T ¼ 0:3846.

Theta is usually negative for an option.7 This is because, as time passes with all else
remaining the same, the option tends to become less valuable. The variation of  with
stock price for a call option on a stock is shown in Figure 19.5. When the stock price is
very low, theta is close to zero. For an at-the-money call option, theta is large and
negative. As the stock price becomes larger, theta tends to rKerT. Figure 19.6 shows
typical patterns for the variation of  with the time to maturity for in-the-money, at-
the-money, and out-of-the-money call options.

CHAPTER 19

Theta is not the same type of hedge parameter as delta. There is uncertainty about
the future stock price, but there is no uncertainty about the passage of time. It makes
sense to hedge against changes in the price of the underlying asset, but it does not make
any sense to hedge against the passage of time. In spite of this, many traders regard
theta as a useful descriptive statistic for a portfolio. This is because, as we shall see later,
in a delta-neutral portfolio theta is a proxy for gamma.
19.6
GAMMA
The gamma () of a portfolio of options on an underlying asset is the rate of change of
the portfolio’s delta with respect to the price of the underlying asset. It is the second
partial derivative of the portfolio with respect to asset price:
 ¼ @2
@S 2
If gamma is small, delta changes slowly, and adjustments to keep a portfolio delta
neutral need to be made only relatively infrequently. However, if gamma is highly
negative or highly positive, delta is very sensitive to the price of the underlying asset. It
is then quite risky to leave a delta-neutral portfolio unchanged for any length of time.
Figure 19.7 illustrates this point. When the stock price moves from S to S 0, delta
hedging assumes that the option price moves from C to C0, when in fact it moves from
C to C00. The diﬀerence between C0 and C00 leads to a hedging error. The size of the
error depends on the curvature of the relationship between the option price and the
stock price. Gamma measures this curvature.
Suppose that S is the price change of an underlying asset during a small interval of
time, t, and  is the corresponding price change in the portfolio. The appendix at
the end of this chapter shows that, if terms of order higher than t are ignored,

for a delta-neutral portfolio, where  is the theta of the portfolio. Figure 19.8 shows the

nature of this relationship between  and S. When gamma is positive, theta tends to
be negative. The portfolio declines in value if there is no change in S, but increases in
value if there is a large positive or negative change in S. When gamma is negative, theta
tends to be positive and the reverse is true: the portfolio increases in value if there is no
change in S but decreases in value if there is a large positive or negative change in S. As
the absolute value of gamma increases, the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to S
increases.
Example 19.3
Suppose that the gamma of a delta-neutral portfolio of options on an asset is
10,000. Equation (19.3) shows that, if a change of þ2 or 2 in the price of the
asset occurs over a short period of time, there is an unexpected decrease in the
value of the portfolio of approximately 0:5  10,000  22 ¼ $20,000.
Making a Portfolio Gamma Neutral
A position in the underlying asset has zero gamma and cannot be used to change the
gamma of a portfolio. What is required is a position in an instrument such as an option
that is not linearly dependent on the underlying asset.

CHAPTER 19

Suppose that a delta-neutral portfolio has a gamma equal to , and a traded option
has a gamma equal to T. If the number of traded options added to the portfolio is wT,
the gamma of the portfolio is
wT T þ 
Hence, the position in the traded option necessary to make the portfolio gamma neutral
is =T. Including the traded option is likely to change the delta of the portfolio, so
the position in the underlying asset then has to be changed to maintain delta neutrality.
Note that the portfolio is gamma neutral only for a short period of time. As time
passes, gamma neutrality can be maintained only if the position in the traded option is
adjusted so that it is always equal to =T.
Making a portfolio gamma neutral as well as delta-neutral can be regarded as a
correction for the hedging error illustrated in Figure 19.7. Delta neutrality provides
protection against relatively small stock price moves between rebalancing. Gamma
neutrality provides protection against larger movements in this stock price between
hedge rebalancing. Suppose that a portfolio is delta neutral and has a gamma of
3,000. The delta and gamma of a particular traded call option are 0.62 and 1.50,
respectively. The portfolio can be made gamma neutral by including in the portfolio a
long position of
3,000
1:5 ¼ 2,000
in the call option. However, the delta of the portfolio will then change from zero to
2,000  0:62 ¼ 1,240. Therefore 1,240 units of the underlying asset must be sold from
the portfolio to keep it delta neutral.

where d1 is deﬁned as in equation (15.20) and N 0ðxÞ is as given by equation (19.2). The
gamma of a long position is always positive and varies with S0 in the way indicated in
Figure 19.9. The variation of gamma with time to maturity for out-of-the-money,
at-the-money, and in-the-money options is shown in Figure 19.10. For an at-the-money
option, gamma increases as the time to maturity decreases. Short-life at-the-money
options have very high gammas, which means that the value of the option holder’s
position is highly sensitive to jumps in the stock price.
Example 19.4
As in Example 19.1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to
maturity is 20 weeks (¼ 0:3846 years), and the volatility is 20%. In this case,
S0 ¼ 49, K ¼ 50, r ¼ 0:05,  ¼ 0:2, and T ¼ 0:3846.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DELTA, THETA, AND GAMMA
The price of a single derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock must satisfy
the diﬀerential equation (15.16). It follows that the value of  of a portfolio of such

Similar results can be produced for other underlying assets (see Problem 19.19).
For a delta-neutral portfolio,  ¼ 0 and

This shows that, when  is large and positive, gamma of a portfolio tends to be large
and negative, and vice versa. This is consistent with the way in which Figure 19.8 has
been drawn and explains why theta can to some extent be regarded as a proxy for
gamma in a delta-neutral portfolio.
19.8
VEGA
Up to now we have implicitly assumed that the volatility of the asset underlying a
derivative is constant. In practice, volatilities change over time. This means that the
value of a derivative is liable to change because of movements in volatility as well as
because of changes in the asset price and the passage of time.
The vega of a portfolio of derivatives, V, is the rate of change of the value of the
portfolio with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset.8
V ¼ @
@
If vega is highly positive or highly negative, the portfolio’s value is very sensitive to
small changes in volatility. If it is close to zero, volatility changes have relatively little
impact on the value of the portfolio.
A position in the underlying asset has zero vega. However, the vega of a portfolio can
be changed, similarly to the way gamma can be changed, by adding a position in a traded
option. If V is the vega of the portfolio and VT is the vega of a traded option, a position
of V=VT in the traded option makes the portfolio instantaneously vega neutral.
Unfortunately, a portfolio that is gamma neutral will not in general be vega neutral,
and vice versa. If a hedger requires a portfolio to be both gamma and vega neutral, at
least two traded derivatives dependent on the underlying asset must usually be used.
Example 19.5
Consider a portfolio that is delta neutral, with a gamma of 5,000 and a vega of
8,000. The options shown in the following table can be traded. The portfolio can

Greek alphabet.
The Greek Letters
437

be made vega neutral by including a long position in 4,000 of Option 1. This would
increase delta to 2,400 and require that 2,400 units of the asset be sold to maintain
delta neutrality. The gamma of the portfolio would change from 5,000 to 3,000.
To make the portfolio gamma and vega neutral, both Option 1 and Option 2
can be used. If w1 and w2 are the quantities of Option 1 and Option 2 that are
added to the portfolio, we require that
5,000 þ 0:5w1 þ 0:8w2 ¼ 0
and
8,000 þ 2:0w1 þ 1:2w2 ¼ 0
The solution to these equations is w1 ¼ 400, w2 ¼ 6,000. The portfolio can there-
fore be made gamma and vega neutral by including 400 of Option 1 and 6,000 of
Option 2. The delta of the portfolio, after the addition of the positions in the two
traded options, is 400  0:6 þ 6,000  0:5 ¼ 3,240. Hence, 3,240 units of the asset
would have to be sold to maintain delta neutrality.
For a European call or put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, vega is given by
V ¼ S0
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
N 0ðd1Þ
where d1 is deﬁned as in equation (15.20). The formula for N 0ðxÞ is given in equa-
tion (19.2). The vega of a long position in a European or American option is always
positive. The general way in which vega varies with S0 is shown in Figure 19.11.
Example 19.6
As in Example 19.1, consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock where
the stock price is $49, the strike price is $50, the risk-free rate is 5%, the time to
maturity is 20 weeks (¼ 0:3846 years), and the volatility is 20%. In this case,
S0 ¼ 49, K ¼ 50, r ¼ 0:05,  ¼ 0:2, and T ¼ 0:3846.
The option’s vega is

Thus a 1% (0.01) increase in the volatility from (20% to 21%) increases the value

Calculating vega from the Black–Scholes–Merton model and its extensions may seem
strange because one of the assumptions underlying the model is that volatility is constant.
It would be theoretically more correct to calculate vega from a model in which volatility is
assumed to be stochastic. However, it turns out that the vega calculated from a stochastic
volatility model is very similar to the Black–Scholes–Merton vega, so the practice of
calculating vega from a model in which volatility is constant works reasonably well.9

CHAPTER 19

Gamma neutrality protects against large changes in the price of the underlying asset
between hedge rebalancing. Vega neutrality protects against a variable . As might be
expected, whether it is best to use an available traded option for vega or gamma
hedging depends on the time between hedge rebalancing and the volatility of the
volatility.10
When volatilities change, the implied volatilities of short-dated options tend to change
by more than the implied volatilities of long-dated options. The vega of a portfolio is
therefore often calculated by changing the volatilities of long-dated options by less than
that of short-dated options. One way of doing this is discussed in Section 23.6.

The option’s rho is

THE REALITIES OF HEDGING
In an ideal world, traders working for ﬁnancial institutions would be able to rebalance
their portfolios very frequently in order to maintain all Greeks equal to zero. In
practice, this is not possible. When managing a large portfolio dependent on a single
underlying asset, traders usually make delta zero, or close to zero, at least once a day by
trading the underlying asset. Unfortunately, a zero gamma and a zero vega are less easy
to achieve because it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd options or other nonlinear derivatives that can be
traded in the volume required at competitive prices. Business Snapshot 19.1 provides a
discussion of how dynamic hedging is organized at ﬁnancial institutions.
As already mentioned, there are big economies of scale in trading derivatives.
Maintaining delta neutrality for a small number of options on an asset by trading
Business Snapshot 19.1
Dynamic Hedging in Practice
In a typical arrangement at a ﬁnancial institution, the responsibility for a portfolio of
derivatives dependent on a particular underlying asset is assigned to one trader or to
a group of traders working together. For example, one trader at Goldman Sachs
might be assigned responsibility for all derivatives dependent on the value of the
Australian dollar. A computer system calculates the value of the portfolio and Greek
letters for the portfolio. Limits are deﬁned for each Greek letter and special
permission is required if a trader wants to exceed a limit at the end of a trading day.
The delta limit is often expressed as the equivalent maximum position in the
underlying asset. For example, the delta limit of Goldman Sachs for a stock might
be $1 million. If the stock price is $50, this means that the absolute value of delta as
we have calculated it can be no more than 20,000. The vega limit is usually expressed
as a maximum dollar exposure per 1% change in the volatility.
As a matter of course, options traders make themselves delta neutral—or close to
delta neutral—at the end of each day. Gamma and vega are monitored, but are not
usually managed on a daily basis. Financial institutions often ﬁnd that their business
with clients involves writing options and that as a result they accumulate negative
gamma and vega. They are then always looking out for opportunities to manage their
gamma and vega risks by buying options at competitive prices.
There is one aspect of an options portfolio that mitigates problems of managing
gamma and vega somewhat. Options are often close to the money when they are ﬁrst
sold, so that they have relatively high gammas and vegas. But after some time has
elapsed, the underlying asset price has often changed enough for them to become
deep out of the money or deep in the money. Their gammas and vegas are then very
small and of little consequence. A nightmare scenario for an options trader is where
written options remain very close to the money as the maturity date is approached.

CHAPTER 19

daily is usually not economically feasible because of trading costs.11 But when a
derivatives dealer maintains delta neutrality for a large portfolio of options on an
asset, the trading costs per option hedged are likely to be much more reasonable.
19.11
SCENARIO ANALYSIS
In addition to monitoring risks such as delta, gamma, and vega, option traders often
also carry out a scenario analysis. The analysis involves calculating the gain or loss on
their portfolio over a speciﬁed period under a variety of diﬀerent scenarios. The time
period chosen is likely to depend on the liquidity of the instruments. The scenarios can
be either chosen by management or generated by a model.
Consider a bank with a portfolio of options on a foreign currency. There are two
main variables on which the value of the portfolio depends. These are the exchange rate
and the exchange-rate volatility. Suppose that the exchange rate is currently 1.0000 and
its volatility is 10% per annum. The bank could calculate a table such as Table 19.5
showing the proﬁt or loss experienced during a 2-week period under diﬀerent scenarios.
This table considers seven diﬀerent exchange rates and three diﬀerent volatilities.
Because a one-standard-deviation move in the exchange rate during a 2-week period
is about 0.02, the exchange rate moves considered are approximately zero, one, two,
and three standard deviations.
In Table 19.5, the greatest loss is in the lower right corner of the table. The loss
corresponds to the volatility increasing to 12% and the exchange rate moving up to
1.06. Usually the greatest loss in a table such as Table 19.5 occurs at one of the corners,
but this is not always so. Consider, for example, the situation where a bank’s portfolio
consists of a short position in a butterﬂy spread (see Section 12.3). The greatest loss will
be experienced if the exchange rate stays where it is.

EXTENSION OF FORMULAS
The formulas produced so far for delta, theta, gamma, vega, and rho have been for a

when the stock pays a continuous dividend yield at rate q. The expressions for d1 and d2
are as for equations (17.4) and (17.5). By setting q equal to the dividend yield on an index,
we obtain the Greek letters for European options on indices. By setting q equal to the
foreign risk-free rate, we obtain the Greek letters for European options on a currency. By
setting q ¼ r, we obtain delta, gamma, theta, and vega for European options on a futures
contract. The rho for a call futures option is cT and the rho for a European put futures
option is pT.
In the case of currency options, there are two rhos corresponding to the two interest
rates. The rho corresponding to the domestic interest rate is given by the formula in
Table 19.6 (with d2 as in equation (17.11)). The rho corresponding to the foreign
interest rate for a European call on a currency is
rhoðcall; foreign rateÞ ¼ Terf TS0Nðd1Þ
For a European put, it is
rhoðput; foreign rateÞ ¼ Terf TS0Nðd1Þ
with d1 as in equation (17.11).
The calculation of Greek letters for American options is discussed in Chapter 21.
Delta of Forward Contracts
The concept of delta can be applied to ﬁnancial instruments other than options. Consider
a forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock. Equation (5.5) shows that the value
of a forward contract is S0  KerT, where K is the delivery price and T is the forward
contract’s time to maturity. When the price of the stock changes by S, with all else
remaining the same, the value of a forward contract on the stock also changes by S. The
delta of a long forward contract on one share of the stock is therefore always 1.0. This

means that a long forward contract on one share can be hedged by shorting one share; a
short forward contract on one share can be hedged by purchasing one share.12
For an asset providing a dividend yield at rate q, equation (5.7) shows that the
forward contract’s delta is eqT. For the delta of a forward contract on a stock index, q
is set equal to the dividend yield on the index in this expression. For the delta of a
forward foreign exchange contract, it is set equal to the foreign risk-free rate, rf.
Delta of a Futures Contract
From equation (5.1), the futures price for a contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is
S0erT, where T is the time to maturity of the futures contract. This shows that when the
price of the stock changes by S, with all else remaining the same, the futures price
changes by S erT. Since futures contracts are settled daily, the holder of a long futures
position makes an almost immediate gain of this amount. The delta of a futures
contract is therefore erT. For a futures position on an asset providing a dividend yield
at rate q, equation (5.3) shows similarly that delta is eðrqÞT.
It is interesting that daily settlement makes the deltas of futures and forward contracts
slightly diﬀerent. This is true even when interest rates are constant and the forward price
equals the futures price. (A related point is made in Business Snapshot 5.2.)
Sometimes a futures contract is used to achieve a delta-neutral position. Deﬁne:
T : Maturity of futures contract
HA: Required position in asset for delta hedging
HF : Alternative required position in futures contracts for delta hedging
If the underlying asset is a non-dividend-paying stock, the analysis we have just given
shows that
HF ¼ erTHA
ð19:5Þ
When the underlying asset pays a dividend yield q,
HF ¼ eðrqÞTHA
ð19:6Þ
For a stock index, we set q equal to the dividend yield on the index; for a currency, we
set it equal to the foreign risk-free rate, rf, so that
HF ¼ eðrrf ÞTHA
ð19:7Þ
Example 19.8
Suppose that a portfolio of currency options held by a US bank can be made
delta neutral with a short position of 458,000 pounds sterling. Risk-free rates are
4% in the US and 7% in the UK. From equation (19.7), hedging using 9-month
currency futures requires a short futures position
eð0:040:07Þ9=12  458,000
or £468,442. Since each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of £62,500, seven
contracts would be shorted. (Seven is the nearest whole number to 468,442/62,500.)
12 These are hedge-and-forget schemes. Since delta is always 1.0, no changes need to be made to the position
in the stock during the life of the contract.

PORTFOLIO INSURANCE
A portfolio manager is often interested in acquiring a put option on his or her portfolio.
This provides protection against market declines while preserving the potential for a
gain if the market does well. One approach (discussed in Section 17.1) is to buy put
options on a market index such as the S&P 500. An alternative is to create the options
synthetically.
Creating an option synthetically involves maintaining a position in the underlying
asset (or futures on the underlying asset) so that the delta of the position is equal to the
delta of the required option. The position necessary to create an option synthetically is
the reverse of that necessary to hedge it. This is because the procedure for hedging an
option involves the creation of an equal and opposite option synthetically.
There are two reasons why it may be more attractive for the portfolio manager to
create the required put option synthetically than to buy it in the market. First, option
markets do not always have the liquidity to absorb the trades required by managers of
large funds. Second, fund managers often require strike prices and exercise dates that are
diﬀerent from those available in exchange-traded options markets.
The synthetic option can be created from trading the portfolio or from trading in
index futures contracts. We ﬁrst examine the creation of a put option by trading the
portfolio. From Table 19.6, the delta of a European put on the portfolio is

The other variables are deﬁned as usual: S0 is the value of the portfolio, K is the strike
price, r is the risk-free rate, q is the dividend yield on the portfolio,  is the volatility of
the portfolio, and T is the life of the option. The volatility of the portfolio can usually
be assumed to be its beta times the volatility of a well-diversiﬁed market index.
To create the put option synthetically, the fund manager should ensure that at any
given time a proportion
eqT½1  Nðd1Þ
of the stocks in the original portfolio has been sold and the proceeds invested in riskless
assets. As the value of the original portfolio declines, the delta of the put given by
equation (19.8) becomes more negative and the proportion of the original portfolio sold
must be increased. As the value of the original portfolio increases, the delta of the put
becomes less negative and the proportion of the original portfolio sold must be
decreased (i.e., some of the original portfolio must be repurchased).
Using this strategy to create portfolio insurance means that at any given time funds
are divided between the stock portfolio on which insurance is required and riskless
assets. As the value of the stock portfolio increases, riskless assets are sold and the
position in the stock portfolio is increased. As the value of the stock portfolio declines,
the position in the stock portfolio is decreased and riskless assets are purchased. The
cost of the insurance arises from the fact that the portfolio manager is always selling
after a decline in the market and buying after a rise in the market.

CHAPTER 19

Example 19.9
A portfolio is worth $90 million. To protect against market downturns the man-
agers of the portfolio require a 6-month European put option on the portfolio
with a strike price of $87 million. The risk-free rate is 9% per annum, the dividend
yield is 3% per annum, and the volatility of the portfolio is 25% per annum. The
S&P 500 index stands at 900. As the portfolio is considered to mimic the S&P 500
fairly closely, one alternative, discussed in Section 17.1, is to buy 1,000 put option
contracts on the S&P 500 with a strike price of 870. Another alternative is to create
the required option synthetically. In this case, S0 ¼ 90 million, K ¼ 87 million,
r ¼ 0:09, q ¼ 0:03,  ¼ 0:25, and T ¼ 0:5, so that
d1 ¼ lnð90=87Þ þ ð0:09  0:03 þ 0:252=2Þ0:5

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

¼ 0:4499
and the delta of the required option is
eqT½Nðd1Þ  1 ¼ 0:3215
This shows that 32.15% of the portfolio should be sold initially and invested in
risk-free assets to match the delta of the required option. The amount of the
portfolio sold must be monitored frequently. For example, if the value of the
portfolio reduces to $88 million after 1 day, the delta of the required option
changes to 0:3679 and a further 4.64% of the original portfolio should be sold
and invested in risk-free assets. If the value of the portfolio increases
to $92 million, the delta of the required option changes to 0:2787 and 4.28%
of the original portfolio should be repurchased.
Use of Index Futures
Using index futures to create options synthetically can be preferable to using the
underlying stocks because the transaction costs associated with trades in index futures
are generally lower than those associated with the corresponding trades in the under-
lying stocks. The dollar amount of the futures contracts shorted as a proportion of the
value of the portfolio should from equations (19.6) and (19.8) be
eqTeðrqÞT ½1  Nðd1Þ ¼ eqðT TÞerT ½1  Nðd1Þ
where T  is the maturity of the futures contract. If the portfolio is worth A1 times the
index and each index futures contract is on A2 times the index, the number of futures
contracts shorted at any given time should be
eqðT TÞerT ½1  Nðd1ÞA1=A2
Example 19.10
Suppose that in the previous example futures contracts on the S&P 500 maturing in
9 months are used to create the option synthetically. In this case initially T ¼ 0:5,
T  ¼ 0:75, A1 ¼ 100,000, and d1 ¼ 0:4499. Each index futures contract is on 250
times the index, so that A2 ¼ 250. The number of futures contracts shorted
should be
eqðT TÞerT ½1  Nðd1ÞA1=A2 ¼ 122:96
The Greek Letters
445

or 123, rounding to the nearest whole number. As time passes and the index
changes, the position in futures contracts must be adjusted.
This analysis assumes that the portfolio mirrors the index. When this is not the case, it
is necessary to (a) calculate the portfolio’s beta, (b) ﬁnd the position in options on the
index that gives the required protection, and (c) choose a position in index futures to
create the options synthetically. As discussed in Section 17.1, the strike price for the
options should be the expected level of the market index when the portfolio reaches its
insured value. The number of options required is beta times the number that would be
required if the portfolio had a beta of 1.0.
19.14
STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY
We discussed in Chapter 15 the issue of whether volatility is caused solely by the arrival
of new information or whether trading itself generates volatility. Portfolio insurance
strategies such as those just described have the potential to increase volatility. When the
market declines, they cause portfolio managers either to sell stock or to sell index
futures contracts. Either action may accentuate the decline (see Business Snapshot 19.2).
The sale of stock is liable to drive down the market index further in a direct way. The
sale of index futures contracts is liable to drive down futures prices. This creates selling
pressure on stocks via the mechanism of index arbitrage (see Chapter 5), so that the
market index is liable to be driven down in this case as well. Similarly, when the market
rises, the portfolio insurance strategies cause portfolio managers either to buy stock or
to buy futures contracts. This may accentuate the rise.
In addition to formal portfolio trading strategies, we can speculate that many investors
consciously or subconsciously follow portfolio insurance rules of their own. For example,
an investor may choose to sell when the market is falling to limit the downside risk.
Whether portfolio insurance trading strategies (formal or informal) aﬀect volatility
depends on how easily the market can absorb the trades that are generated by portfolio
insurance. If portfolio insurance trades are a very small fraction of all trades, there is
likely to be no eﬀect. But if portfolio insurance becomes very popular, it is liable to
have a destabilizing eﬀect on the market, as it did in 1987.
SUMMARY
Financial institutions oﬀer a variety of option products to their clients. Often the
options do not correspond to the standardized products traded by exchanges. The
ﬁnancial institutions are then faced with the problem of hedging their exposure. Naked
and covered positions leave them subject to an unacceptable level of risk. One course of
action that is sometimes proposed is a stop-loss strategy. This involves holding a naked
position when an option is out of the money and converting it to a covered position as
soon as the option moves into the money. Although superﬁcially attractive, the strategy
does not provide a good hedge.
The delta () of an option is the rate of change of its price with respect to the price of
the underlying asset. Delta hedging involves creating a position with zero delta (some-
times referred to as a delta-neutral position). Because the delta of the underlying asset
446
CHAPTER 19

is 1.0, one way of hedging is to take a position of  in the underlying asset for each
long option being hedged. The delta of an option changes over time. This means that
the position in the underlying asset has to be frequently adjusted.
Once an option position has been made delta neutral, the next stage is often to look
at its gamma (). The gamma of an option is the rate of change of its delta with respect
to the price of the underlying asset. It is a measure of the curvature of the relationship
between the option price and the asset price. The impact of this curvature on the
performance of delta hedging can be reduced by making an option position gamma
neutral. If  is the gamma of the position being hedged, this reduction is usually
achieved by taking a position in a traded option that has a gamma of .
Delta and gamma hedging are both based on the assumption that the volatility of the
underlying asset is constant. In practice, volatilities do change over time. The vega of an
option or an option portfolio measures the rate of change of its value with respect to
volatility. A trader who wishes to hedge an option position against volatility changes can
make the position vega neutral. As with the procedure for creating gamma neutrality, this
usually involves taking an oﬀsetting position in a traded option. If the trader wishes to
achieve both gamma and vega neutrality, two traded options are usually required.
Two other measures of the risk of an option position are theta and rho. Theta
measures the rate of change of the value of the position with respect to the passage of
time, with all else remaining constant. Rho measures the rate of change of the value of
the position with respect to the interest rate, with all else remaining constant.
Business Snapshot 19.2
Was Portfolio Insurance to Blame for the Crash
of 1987?
On Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more
than 20%. Many people feel that portfolio insurance played a major role in this crash.
In October 1987 between $60 billion and $90 billion of equity assets were subject to
portfolio insurance trading rules where put options were created synthetically in the
way discussed in Section 19.13. During the period Wednesday, October 14, 1987, to
Friday, October 16, 1987, the market declined by about 10%, with much of this
decline taking place on Friday afternoon. The portfolio trading rules should have
generated at least $12 billion of equity or index futures sales as a result of this decline.
In fact, portfolio insurers had time to sell only $4 billion and they approached the
following week with huge amounts of selling already dictated by their models. It is
estimated that on Monday, October 19, sell programs by three portfolio insurers
accounted for almost 10% of the sales on the New York Stock Exchange, and that
portfolio insurance sales amounted to 21.3% of all sales in index futures markets. It is
likely that the decline in equity prices was exacerbated by investors other than portfolio
insurers selling heavily because they anticipated the actions of portfolio insurers.
Because the market declined so fast and the stock exchange systems were over-
loaded, many portfolio insurers were unable to execute the trades generated by their
models and failed to obtain the protection they required. Needless to say, the
popularity of portfolio insurance schemes has declined signiﬁcantly since 1987.
One of the morals of this story is that it is dangerous to follow a particular trading
strategy—even a hedging strategy—when many other market participants are doing
the same thing.
The Greek Letters
447

In practice, option traders usually rebalance their portfolios at least once a day to
maintain delta neutrality. It is usually not feasible to maintain gamma and vega
neutrality on a regular basis. Typically a trader monitors these measures. If they get
too large, either corrective action is taken or trading is curtailed.
Portfolio managers are sometimes interested in creating put options synthetically for
the purposes of insuring an equity portfolio. They can do so either by trading the
portfolio or by trading index futures on the portfolio. Trading the portfolio involves
splitting the portfolio between equities and risk-free securities. As the market declines,
more is invested in risk-free securities. As the market increases, more is invested in
equities. Trading index futures involves keeping the equity portfolio intact and selling
index futures. As the market declines, more index futures are sold; as it rises, fewer are
sold. This type of portfolio insurance works well in normal market conditions. On
Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped very
sharply, it worked badly. Portfolio insurers were unable to sell either stocks or index
futures fast enough to protect their positions.

APPENDIX
TAYLOR SERIES EXPANSIONS AND HEDGE PARAMETERS
A Taylor series expansion of the change in the portfolio value in a short period of time
shows the role played by diﬀerent Greek letters. If the volatility of the underlying asset
is assumed to be constant, the value  of the portfolio is a function of the asset price S,
and time t. The Taylor series expansion gives
 ¼ @
@S S þ @
@t t þ 1
2
@2
@S 2 S 2 þ 1
2
@2
@t2 t2 þ @2
@S @t S t þ   
ð19A:1Þ
where  and S are the change in  and S in a small time interval t. Delta hedging
eliminates the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side. The second term is nonstochastic. The
third term (which is of order t) can be made zero by ensuring that the portfolio is
gamma neutral as well as delta neutral. Other terms are of order higher than t.
For a delta-neutral portfolio, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of equation (19A.1)
is zero, so that
 ¼  t þ 1
2 S 2
when terms of order higher than t are ignored. This is equation (19.3).
When the volatility of the underlying asset is uncertain,  is a function of , S, and t.
Equation (19A.1) then becomes
 ¼ @
@S S þ @

@t t þ 1

@2
@S 2 S 2 þ 1

@2 2 þ   
where  is the change in  in time t. In this case, delta hedging eliminates the ﬁrst
term on the right-hand side. The second term is eliminated by making the portfolio
vega neutral. The third term is nonstochastic. The fourth term is eliminated by making
the portfolio gamma neutral. Traders sometimes deﬁne other Greek letters to corres-
pond to later terms in the expansion.

CHAPTER 19

Volatility Smiles
How close are the market prices of options to those predicted by the Black–Scholes–
Merton model? Do traders really use the Black–Scholes–Merton model when determin-
ing a price for an option? Are the probability distributions of asset prices really log-
normal? This chapter answers these questions. It explains that traders do use the Black–
Scholes–Merton model—but not in exactly the way that Black, Scholes, and Merton
originally intended. This is because they allow the volatility used to price an option to
depend on its strike price and time to maturity.
A plot of the implied volatility of an option with a certain life as a function of its strike
price is known as a volatility smile. This chapter describes the volatility smiles that traders
use in equity and foreign currency markets. It explains the relationship between a
volatility smile and the risk-neutral probability distribution being assumed for the future
asset price. It also discusses how option traders use volatility surfaces as pricing tools.
20.1
WHY THE VOLATILITY SMILE IS THE SAME FOR CALLS AND PUTS
This section shows that the implied volatility of a European call option is the same as
that of a European put option when they have the same strike price and time to
maturity. This means that the volatility smile for European calls with a certain maturity
is the same as that for European puts with the same maturity. This is a particularly
convenient result. It shows that when talking about a volatility smile we do not have to
worry about whether the options are calls or puts.
As explained in earlier chapters, put–call parity provides a relationship between the
prices of European call and put options when they have the same strike price and time
to maturity. With a dividend yield on the underlying asset of q, the relationship is
p þ S0eqT ¼ c þ KerT
ð20:1Þ
As usual, c and p are the European call and put price. They have the same strike
price, K, and time to maturity, T. The variable S0 is the price of the underlying asset
today, and r is the risk-free interest rate for maturity T.
A key feature of the put–call parity relationship is that it is based on a relatively
simple no-arbitrage argument. It does not require any assumption about the probability
453
20
C H A P T E R

distribution of the asset price in the future. It is true both when the asset price
distribution is lognormal and when it is not lognormal.
Suppose that, for a particular value of the volatility, pBS and cBS are the values of
European put and call options calculated using the Black–Scholes–Merton model.
Suppose further that pmkt and cmkt are the market values of these options. Because
put–call parity holds for the Black–Scholes–Merton model, we must have
pBS þ S0eqT ¼ cBS þ KerT
In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, put–call parity also holds for the market
prices, so that
pmkt þ S0eqT ¼ cmkt þ KerT
Subtracting these two equations, we get
pBS  pmkt ¼ cBS  cmkt
ð20:2Þ
This shows that the dollar pricing error when the Black–Scholes–Merton model is used
to price a European put option should be exactly the same as the dollar pricing error
when it is used to price a European call option with the same strike price and time to
maturity.
Suppose that the implied volatility of the put option is 22%. This means that
pBS ¼ pmkt when a volatility of 22% is used in the Black–Scholes–Merton model. From
equation (20.2), it follows that cBS ¼ cmkt when this volatility is used. The implied
volatility of the call is, therefore, also 22%. This argument shows that the implied
volatility of a European call option is always the same as the implied volatility of a
European put option when the two have the same strike price and maturity date. To put
this another way, for a given strike price and maturity, the correct volatility to use in
conjunction with the Black–Scholes–Merton model to price a European call should
always be the same as that used to price a European put. This means that the volatility
smile (i.e., the relationship between implied volatility and strike price for a particular
maturity) is the same for European calls and European puts. More generally, it means
that the volatility surface (i.e., the implied volatility as a function of strike price and time
to maturity) is the same for European calls and European puts. These results are also true
to a good approximation for American options.
Example 20.1
The value of a foreign currency is $0.60. The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum
in the United States and 10% per annum in the foreign country. The market price
of a European call option on the foreign currency with a maturity of 1 year and a
strike price of $0.59 is 0.0236. DerivaGem shows that the implied volatility of the
call is 14.5%. For there to be no arbitrage, the put–call parity relationship in
equation (20.1) must apply with q equal to the foreign risk-free rate. The price p
of a European put option with a strike price of $0.59 and maturity of 1 year
therefore satisﬁes
p þ 0:60e0:101 ¼ 0:0236 þ 0:59e0:051
so that p ¼ 0:0419. DerivaGem shows that, when the put has this price, its implied
volatility is also 14.5%. This is what we expect from the analysis just given.

20.2
FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS
The volatility smile used by traders to price foreign currency options has the general
form shown in Figure 20.1. The implied volatility is relatively low for at-the-money
options. It becomes progressively higher as an option moves either into the money or
out of the money.
In the appendix at the end of this chapter, we show how to determine the risk-
neutral probability distribution for an asset price at a future time from the volatility
smile given by options maturing at that time. We refer to this as the implied
distribution. The volatility smile in Figure 20.1 corresponds to the implied distribution
shown by the solid line in Figure 20.2. A lognormal distribution with the same mean
and standard deviation as the implied distribution is shown by the dashed line in
Figure 20.2. It can be seen that the implied distribution has heavier tails than the
lognormal distribution.1
To see that Figures 20.1 and 20.2 are consistent with each other, consider ﬁrst a deep-
out-of-the-money call option with a high strike price of K2. This option pays oﬀonly if
the exchange rate proves to be above K2. Figure 20.2 shows that the probability of this
is higher for the implied probability distribution than for the lognormal distribution.
We therefore expect the implied distribution to give a relatively high price for the
option. A relatively high price leads to a relatively high implied volatility—and this is
exactly what we observe in Figure 20.1 for the option. The two ﬁgures are therefore
consistent with each other for high strike prices. Consider next a deep-out-of-the-
money put option with a low strike price of K1. This option pays oﬀonly if the
exchange rate proves to be below K1. Figure 20.2 shows that the probability of this is
also higher for the implied probability distribution than for the lognormal distribution.
We therefore expect the implied distribution to give a relatively high price, and a
relatively high implied volatility, for this option as well. Again, this is exactly what we
observe in Figure 20.1.

‘‘peaked.’’ Both small and large movements in the exchange rate are more likely than with the lognormal
distribution. Intermediate movements are less likely.

Empirical Results
We have just shown that the volatility smile used by traders for foreign currency options
implies that they consider that the lognormal distribution understates the probability of
extreme movements in exchange rates. To test whether they are right, Table 20.1
examines the daily movements in 12 diﬀerent exchange rates over a 10-year period.2
The ﬁrst step in the production of the table is to calculate the standard deviation of
daily percentage change in each exchange rate. The next stage is to note how often the
actual percentage change exceeded 1 standard deviation, 2 standard deviations, and so
on. The ﬁnal stage is to calculate how often this would have happened if the percentage
changes had been normally distributed. (The lognormal model implies that percentage
changes are almost exactly normally distributed over a one-day time period.)

CHAPTER 20

Daily changes exceed 3 standard deviations on 1.34% of days. The lognormal model
predicts that this should happen on only 0.27% of days. Daily changes exceed 4, 5, and
6 standard deviations on 0.29%, 0.08%, and 0.03% of days, respectively. The log-
normal model predicts that we should hardly ever observe this happening. The table
therefore provides evidence to support the existence of heavy tails (Figure 20.2) and the
volatility smile used by traders (Figure 20.1). Business Snapshot 20.1 shows how you
could have made money if you had done the analysis in Table 20.1 ahead of the rest of
the market.
Reasons for the Smile in Foreign Currency Options
Why are exchange rates not lognormally distributed? Two of the conditions for an asset
price to have a lognormal distribution are:
1. The volatility of the asset is constant.
2. The price of the asset changes smoothly with no jumps.
In practice, neither of these conditions is satisﬁed for an exchange rate. The volatility of
an exchange rate is far from constant, and exchange rates frequently exhibit jumps.3 It
turns out that the eﬀect of both a nonconstant volatility and jumps is that extreme
outcomes become more likely.
The impact of jumps and nonconstant volatility depends on the option maturity. As
the maturity of the option is increased, the percentage impact of a nonconstant
volatility on prices becomes more pronounced, but its percentage impact on implied
volatility usually becomes less pronounced. The percentage impact of jumps on both
Business Snapshot 20.1
Making Money from Foreign Currency Options
Black, Scholes, and Merton in their option pricing model assume that the underlying’s
asset price has a lognormal distribution at future times. This is equivalent to the
assumption that asset price changes over a short period of time, such as one day, are
normally distributed. Suppose that most market participants are comfortable with the
Black–Scholes–Merton assumptions for exchange rates. You have just done the
analysis in Table 20.1 and know that the lognormal assumption is not a good one
for exchange rates. What should you do?
The answer is that you should buy deep-out-of-the-money call and put options on
a variety of diﬀerent currencies and wait. These options will be relatively inexpensive
and more of them will close in the money than the lognormal model predicts. The
present value of your payoﬀs will on average be much greater than the cost of the
options.
In the mid-1980s, a few traders knew about the heavy tails of foreign exchange
probability distributions. Everyone else thought that the lognormal assumption of
Black–Scholes–Merton was reasonable. The few traders who were well informed
followed the strategy we have described—and made lots of money. By the late 1980s
everyone realized that foreign currency options should be priced with a volatility
smile and the trading opportunity disappeared.

prices and the implied volatility becomes less pronounced as the maturity of the option
is increased.4 The result of all this is that the volatility smile becomes less pronounced as
option maturity increases.
20.3
EQUITY OPTIONS
Prior to the crash of 1987, there was no marked volatility smile for equity options. Since
1987, the volatility smile used by traders to price equity options (both on individual
stocks and on stock indices) has had the general form shown in Figure 20.3. This is
sometimes referred to as a volatility skew. The volatility decreases as the strike price
increases. The volatility used to price a low-strike-price option (i.e., a deep-out-of-the-
money put or a deep-in-the-money call) is signiﬁcantly higher than that used to price a
high-strike-price option (i.e., a deep-in-the-money put or a deep-out-of-the-money call).
The volatility smile for equity options corresponds to the implied probability dis-
tribution given by the solid line in Figure 20.4. A lognormal distribution with the same
mean and standard deviation as the implied distribution is shown by the dotted line. It
can be seen that the implied distribution has a heavier left tail and a less heavy right tail
than the lognormal distribution.
To see that Figures 20.3 and 20.4 are consistent with each other, we proceed as for
Figures 20.1 and 20.2 and consider options that are deep out of the money. From
Figure 20.4, a deep-out-of-the-money call with a strike price of K2 has a lower price

4 When we look at suﬃciently long-dated options, jumps tend to get ‘‘averaged out,’’ so that the exchange
rate distribution when there are jumps is almost indistinguishable from the one obtained when the exchange
rate changes smoothly.

CHAPTER 20

when the implied distribution is used than when the lognormal distribution is used.
This is because the option pays oﬀonly if the stock price proves to be above K2, and the
probability of this is lower for the implied probability distribution than for the log-
normal distribution. Therefore, we expect the implied distribution to give a relatively
low price for the option. A relatively low price leads to a relatively low implied
volatility—and this is exactly what we observe in Figure 20.3 for the option. Consider
next a deep-out-of-the-money put option with a strike price of K1. This option pays oﬀ
only if the stock price proves to be below K1. Figure 20.4 shows that the probability of
this is higher for the implied probability distribution than for the lognormal distribu-
tion. We therefore expect the implied distribution to give a relatively high price, and a
relatively high implied volatility, for this option. Again, this is exactly what we observe
in Figure 20.3.
The Reason for the Smile in Equity Options
One possible explanation for the smile in equity options concerns leverage. As a
company’s equity declines in value, the company’s leverage increases. This means that
the equity becomes more risky and its volatility increases. As a company’s equity
increases in value, leverage decreases. The equity then becomes less risky and its volatility
decreases. This argument suggests that we can expect the volatility of a stock to be a
decreasing function of the stock price and is consistent with Figures 20.3 and 20.4.
Another explanation is ‘‘crashophobia’’ (see Business Snapshot 20.2).
20.4
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF CHARACTERIZING THE
VOLATILITY SMILE
So far we have deﬁned the volatility smile as the relationship between implied volatility
and strike price. The relationship depends on the current price of the asset. For
example, the lowest point of the volatility smile in Figure 20.1 is usually close to the
K1

K2

Implied distribution and lognormal distribution for equity options.
Volatility Smiles

current exchange rate. If the exchange rate increases, the volatility smile tends to move
to the right; if the exchange rate decreases, the volatility smile tends to move to the left.
Similarly, in Figure 20.3, when the equity price increases, the volatility skew tends to
move to the right, and when the equity price decreases, it tends to move to the left.5 For
this reason the volatility smile is often calculated as the relationship between the implied
volatility and K=S0 rather than as the relationship between the implied volatility and K.
The smile is then much more stable.
A reﬁnement of this is to calculate the volatility smile as the relationship between the
implied volatility and K=F0, where F0 is the forward price of the asset for a contract
maturing at the same time as the options that are considered. Traders also often deﬁne
an ‘‘at-the-money’’ option as an option where K ¼ F0, not as an option where K ¼ S0.
The argument for this is that F0, not S0, is the expected stock price on the option’s
maturity date in a risk-neutral world.
Yet another approach to deﬁning the volatility smile is as the relationship between the
implied volatility and the delta of the option (where delta is deﬁned as in Chapter 19).
This approach sometimes makes it possible to apply volatility smiles to options other
than European and American calls and puts. When the approach is used, an at-the-
money option is then deﬁned as a call option with a delta of 0.5 or a put option with a
delta of 0.5. These are referred to as ‘‘50-delta options.’’
20.5
THE VOLATILITY TERM STRUCTURE AND VOLATILITY
SURFACES
Traders allow the implied volatility to depend on time to maturity as well as strike price.
Implied volatility tends to be an increasing function of maturity when short-dated
volatilities are historically low. This is because there is then an expectation that
volatilities will increase. Similarly, volatility tends to be a decreasing function of
maturity when short-dated volatilities are historically high. This is because there is
then an expectation that volatilities will decrease.
Volatility surfaces combine volatility smiles with the volatility term structure to
tabulate the volatilities appropriate for pricing an option with any strike price and
Business Snapshot 20.2
Crashophobia
It is interesting that the pattern in Figure 20.3 for equities has existed only since the
stock market crash of October 1987. Prior to October 1987, implied volatilities were
much less dependent on strike price. This has led Mark Rubinstein to suggest that
one reason for the equity volatility smile may be ‘‘crashophobia.’’ Traders are
concerned about the possibility of another crash similar to October 1987, and they
price options accordingly.
There is some empirical support for this explanation. Declines in the S&P 500 tend
to be accompanied by a steepening of the volatility skew. When the S&P increases,
the skew tends to become less steep.
5 Research by Derman suggests that this adjustment is sometimes ‘‘sticky’’ in the case of exchange-traded
options. See E. Derman, ‘‘Regimes of Volatility,’’ Risk, April 1999: 55–59.

CHAPTER 20

any maturity. An example of a volatility surface that might be used for foreign currency
options is given in Table 20.2.
One dimension of Table 20.2 is K=S0; the other is time to maturity. The main body of
the table shows implied volatilities calculated from the Black–Scholes–Merton model. At
any given time, some of the entries in the table are likely to correspond to options for
which reliable market data are available. The implied volatilities for these options are
calculated directly from their market prices and entered into the table. The rest of the
table is typically determined using interpolation. The table shows that the volatility smile
becomes less pronounced as the option maturity increases. As mentioned earlier, this is
what is observed for currency options. (It is also what is observed for options on most
other assets.)
When a new option has to be valued, ﬁnancial engineers look up the appropriate
volatility in the table. For example, when valuing a 9-month option with a K=S0 ratio of
1.05, a ﬁnancial engineer would interpolate between 13.4 and 14.0 in Table 20.2 to
obtain a volatility of 13.7%. This is the volatility that would be used in the Black–
Scholes–Merton formula or a binomial tree. When valuing a 1.5-year option with a
K=S0 ratio of 0.925, a two-dimensional (bilinear) interpolation would be used to give an
implied volatility of 14.525%.
The shape of the volatility smile depends on the option maturity. As illustrated in
Table 20.2, the smile tends to become less pronounced as the option maturity increases.
Deﬁne T as the time to maturity and F0 as the forward price of the asset for a contract
maturing at the same time as the option. Some ﬁnancial engineers choose to deﬁne the
volatility smile as the relationship between implied volatility and
1ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

rather than as the relationship between the implied volatility and K. The smile is then
usually much less dependent on the time to maturity.
20.6
GREEK LETTERS
The volatility smile complicates the calculation of Greek letters. Assume that the
relationship between the implied volatility and K=S for an option with a certain time

to maturity remains the same.6 As the price of the underlying asset changes, the implied
volatility of the option changes to reﬂect the option’s ‘‘moneyness’’ (i.e., the extent to
which it is in or out of the money). The formulas for Greek letters given in Chapter 19
are no longer correct. For example, the delta of a call option is given by
@cBS
@S þ @cBS
@imp
@imp
@S
where cBS is the Black–Scholes price of the option expressed as a function of the asset
price S and the implied volatility imp. Consider the impact of this formula on the delta of
an equity call option. Volatility is a decreasing function of K=S. This means that the
implied volatility increases as the asset price increases, so that
@imp
@S
> 0
As a result, delta is higher than that given by the Black–Scholes–Merton assumptions.
In practice, banks try to ensure that their exposure to the most commonly observed
changes in the volatility surface is reasonably small. One technique for identifying these
changes is principal components analysis, which we discuss in Chapter 22.
20.7
THE ROLE OF THE MODEL
How important is the option-pricing model if traders are prepared to use a diﬀerent
volatility for every option? It can be argued that the Black–Scholes–Merton model is no
more than a sophisticated interpolation tool used by traders for ensuring that an option
is priced consistently with the market prices of other actively traded options. If traders
stopped using Black–Scholes–Merton and switched to another plausible model, then the
volatility surface and the shape of the smile would change, but arguably the dollar prices
quoted in the market would not change appreciably. Even delta, if calculated as outlined
in the previous section, does not change too much as the model is changed.
Models have most eﬀect on the pricing of derivatives when similar derivatives do not
trade actively in the market. For example, the pricing of many of the nonstandard
exotic derivatives we will discuss in later chapters is model-dependent.
20.8
WHEN A SINGLE LARGE JUMP IS ANTICIPATED
Let us now consider an example of how an unusual volatility smile might arise in equity
markets. Suppose that a stock price is currently $50 and an important news announce-
ment due in a few days is expected either to increase the stock price by $8 or to reduce it
by $8. (This announcement could concern the outcome of a takeover attempt or the
verdict in an important lawsuit.) The probability distribution of the stock price in, say,
1 month might then consist of a mixture of two lognormal distributions, the ﬁrst
6 It is interesting that this natural model is internally consistent only when the volatility smile is ﬂat for all
maturities. See, for example, T. Daglish, J. Hull, and W. Suo, ‘‘Volatility Surfaces: Theory, Rules of Thumb,
and Empirical Evidence,’’ Quantitative Finance, 7, 5 (October 2007): 507–24.

corresponding to favorable news, the second to unfavorable news. The situation is
illustrated in Figure 20.5. The solid line shows the mixture-of-lognormals distribution
for the stock price in 1 month; the dashed line shows a lognormal distribution with the
same mean and standard deviation as this distribution.
The true probability distribution is bimodal (certainly not lognormal). One easy way
to investigate the general eﬀect of a bimodal stock price distribution is to consider the
extreme case where there are only two possible future stock prices. This is what we will
now do.
Suppose that the stock price is currently $50 and that it is known that in 1 month it
will be either $42 or $58. Suppose further that the risk-free rate is 12% per annum. The
situation is illustrated in Figure 20.6. Options can be valued using the binomial model
from Chapter 13. In this case u ¼ 1:16, d ¼ 0:84, a ¼ 1:0101, and p ¼ 0:5314. The
results from valuing a range of diﬀerent options are shown in Table 20.3. The ﬁrst
column shows alternative strike prices; the second column shows prices of 1-month
European call options; the third column shows the prices of one-month European put
option prices; the fourth column shows implied volatilities. (As shown in Section 20.1,
the implied volatility of a European put option is the same as that of a European call
option when they have the same strike price and maturity.) Figure 20.7 displays the
volatility smile from Table 20.3. It is actually a ‘‘frown’’ (the opposite of that observed

volatility implied from an option with a strike price of 50 will overprice an option with
a strike price of 44 or 56.
SUMMARY
The Black–Scholes–Merton model and its extensions assume that the probability
distribution of the underlying asset at any given future time is lognormal. This
assumption is not the one made by traders. They assume the probability distribution
of an equity price has a heavier left tail and a less heavy right tail than the lognormal

distribution. They also assume that the probability distribution of an exchange rate has
a heavier right tail and a heavier left tail than the lognormal distribution.
Traders use volatility smiles to allow for nonlognormality. The volatility smile deﬁnes
the relationship between the implied volatility of an option and its strike price. For
equity options, the volatility smile tends to be downward sloping. This means that out-
of-the-money puts and in-the-money calls tend to have high implied volatilities whereas
out-of-the-money calls and in-the-money puts tend to have low implied volatilities. For
foreign currency options, the volatility smile is U-shaped. Both out-of-the-money and
in-the-money options have higher implied volatilities than at-the-money options.
Often traders also use a volatility term structure. The implied volatility of an option
then depends on its life. When volatility smiles and volatility term structures are
combined, they produce a volatility surface. This deﬁnes implied volatility as a function
of both the strike price and the time to maturity.

expected to jump to $50. What is the risk-neutral probability of a favorable ruling?
Assume that the volatility of the company’s stock will be 25% for 6 months after the
ruling if the ruling is favorable and 40% if it is unfavorable. Use DerivaGem to calculate
the relationship between implied volatility and strike price for 6-month European
options on the company today. The company does not pay dividends. Assume that
the 6-month risk-free rate is 6%. Consider call options with strike prices of $30, $40, $50,
$60, $70, and $80.
20.15. An exchange rate is currently 0.8000. The volatility of the exchange rate is quoted as
12% and interest rates in the two countries are the same. Using the lognormal
assumption, estimate the probability that the exchange rate in 3 months will be (a) less
than 0.7000, (b) between 0.7000 and 0.7500, (c) between 0.7500 and 0.8000, (d) between
0.8000 and 0.8500, (e) between 0.8500 and 0.9000, and (f) greater than 0.9000. Based on

the volatility smile usually observed in the market for exchange rates, which of these
estimates would you expect to be too low and which would you expect to be too high?
20.16. A stock price is $40. A 6-month European call option on the stock with a strike price of
$30 has an implied volatility of 35%. A 6-month European call option on the stock with
a strike price of $50 has an implied volatility of 28%. The 6-month risk-free rate is 5%
and no dividends are expected. Explain why the two implied volatilities are diﬀerent. Use
DerivaGem to calculate the prices of the two options. Use put–call parity to calculate
the prices of 6-month European put options with strike prices of $30 and $50. Use
DerivaGem to calculate the implied volatilities of these two put options.

given by

ST ¼K

Diﬀerentiating again with respect to K gives

This shows that the probability density function g is given by
gðKÞ ¼ erT @2c
@K2
ð20A:1Þ
This result, which is from Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), allows risk-neutral prob-
ability distributions to be estimated from volatility smiles.7 Suppose that c1, c2, and c3
are the prices of T-year European call options with strike prices of K  , K, and K þ ,
respectively. Assuming  is small, an estimate of gðKÞ, obtained by approximating the
partial derivative in equation (20A.1), is
erT c1 þ c3  2c2
2
For another way of understanding this formula, suppose you set up a butterﬂy spread
with strike prices K  , K, and K þ , and maturity T. This means that you buy a call
with strike price K  , buy a call with strike price K þ , and sell two calls with strike
price K. The value of your position is c1 þ c3  2c2. The value of the position can also be
calculated by integrating the payoﬀover the risk-neutral probability distribution, gðSTÞ,
and discounting at the risk-free rate. The payoﬀis shown in Figure 20A.1. Since  is small,
we can assume that gðSTÞ ¼ gðKÞ in the whole of the range K   < ST < K þ , where
the payoﬀis nonzero. The area under the ‘‘spike’’ in Figure 20A.1 is 0:5  2   ¼ 2.
The value of the payoﬀ(when  is small) is therefore erTgðKÞ2. It follows that
erTgðKÞ2 ¼ c1 þ c3  2c2

Example 20A.1
Suppose that the price of a non-dividend-paying stock is $10, the risk-free interest
rate is 3%, and the implied volatilities of 3-month European options with strike
prices of $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14 are 30%, 29%, 28%, 27%, 26%,
25%, 24%, 23%, 22%, respectively. One way of applying the above results is as
follows. Assume that gðST Þ is constant between ST ¼ 6 and ST ¼ 7, constant
between ST ¼ 7 and ST ¼ 8, and so on. Deﬁne:
gðSTÞ ¼ g1
for
6 6 ST < 7
gðSTÞ ¼ g2
for
7 6 ST < 8
gðSTÞ ¼ g3
for
8 6 ST < 9
gðSTÞ ¼ g4
for
9 6 ST < 10
gðSTÞ ¼ g5
for
10 6 ST < 11
gðSTÞ ¼ g6
for
11 6 ST < 12
gðSTÞ ¼ g7
for
12 6 ST < 13
gðSTÞ ¼ g8
for
13 6 ST < 14
The value of g1 can be calculated by interpolating to get the implied volatility for
a 3-month option with a strike price of $6.5 as 29.5%. This means that options
with strike prices of $6, $6.5, and $7 have implied volatilities of 30%, 29.5%, and
29%, respectively. From DerivaGem their prices are $4.045, $3.549, and $3.055,
respectively. Using equation (20A.2), with K ¼ 6:5 and  ¼ 0:5, gives
g1 ¼ e0:030:25ð4:045 þ 3:055  2  3:549Þ

Figure 20A.2 displays the implied distribution. (Note that the area under the
probability distribution is 0.9985. The probability that ST < 6 or ST > 14 is there-
fore 0.0015.) Although not obvious from Figure 20A.2, the implied distribution
does have a heavier left tail and less heavy right tail than a lognormal distribu-
tion. For the lognormal distribution based on a single volatility of 26%, the
probability of a stock price between $6 and $7 is 0.0031 (compared with 0.0057
in Figure 20A.2) and the probability of a stock price between $13 and $14 is

Basic Numerical
Procedures
This chapter discusses three numerical procedures for valuing derivatives when analytic
results such as the Black–Scholes–Merton formulas do not exist. The ﬁrst represents the
asset price movements in the form of a tree and was introduced in Chapter 13. The
second is Monte Carlo simulation, which we encountered brieﬂy in Chapter 14 when
stochastic processes were explained. The third involves ﬁnite diﬀerence methods.
Monte Carlo simulation is usually used for derivatives where the payoﬀis dependent
on the history of the underlying variable or where there are several underlying variables.
Trees and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods are usually used for American options and other
derivatives where the holder has decisions to make prior to maturity. In addition to
valuing a derivative, all the procedures can be used to calculate Greek letters such as
delta, gamma, and vega.
The basic procedures discussed in this chapter can be used to handle most of the
derivatives valuation problems encountered in practice. However, sometimes they have to
be adapted to cope with particular situations, as will be explained in Chapter 27.
21.1
BINOMIAL TREES
Binomial trees were introduced in Chapter 13. They can be used to value either
European or American options. The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas and their exten-
sions that were presented in Chapters 15, 17, and 18 provide analytic valuations for
European options.1 There are no analytic valuations for American options. Binomial
trees are therefore most useful for valuing these types of options.2
As explained in Chapter 13, the binomial tree valuation approach involves dividing
the life of the option into a large number of small time intervals of length t. It assumes
that in each time interval the price of the underlying asset moves from its initial value of
S to one of two new values, Su and Sd. The approach is illustrated in Figure 21.1. In
1 The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas are based on the same set of assumptions as binomial trees. As shown
in the appendix to Chapter 13, in the limit as the number of time steps is increased, the price given by a
binomial tree for a European option converges to the Black–Scholes–Merton price.
2 Some analytic approximations for valuing American options have been suggested. See, for example,
Technical Note 8 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes for a description of the quadratic
approximation approach.

general, u > 1 and d < 1. The movement from S to Su, therefore, is an ‘‘up’’ movement
and the movement from S to Sd is a ‘‘down’’ movement. The probability of an up
movement will be denoted by p. The probability of a down movement is 1  p.
Risk-Neutral Valuation
The risk-neutral valuation principle, explained in Chapters 13 and 15, states that an
option (or other derivative) can be valued on the assumption that the world is risk
neutral. This means that for valuation purposes we can use the following procedure:
1. Assume that the expected return from all traded assets is the risk-free interest rate.
2. Value payoﬀs from the derivative by calculating their expected values and
discounting at the risk-free interest rate.
This principle underlies the way trees are used.
Determination of p, u, and d
The parameters p, u, and d must give correct values for the mean and variance of asset
price changes during a time interval of length t. Because we are working in a risk-
neutral world, the expected return from the asset is the risk-free interest rate, r. Suppose
that the asset provides a yield of q. The expected return in the form of capital gains must
be r  q. This means that the expected value of the asset price at the end of a time interval
of length t must be SeðrqÞt, where S is the asset price at the beginning of the time
interval. To match the mean return with the tree, we therefore need
SeðrqÞt ¼ pSu þ ð1  pÞSd
or
eðrqÞt ¼ pu þ ð1  pÞd
ð21:1Þ
The variance of a variable Q is deﬁned as EðQ2Þ  ½EðQÞ2. Deﬁning R as the
percentage change in the asset price in time t, there is a probability p that 1 þ R is
u and a probability 1  p that it is d. Using equation (21.1), it follows that the variance
of 1 þ R is
pu2 þ ð1  pÞd 2  e2ðrqÞt
Since adding a constant to a variable makes no diﬀerence to its variance, the variance
of 1 þ R is the same as the variance of R. As explained in Section 15.4, this is 2 t.

Hence,
pu2 þ ð1  pÞd 2  e2ðrqÞt ¼ 2t
From equation (21.1), eðrqÞtðu þ dÞ ¼ pu2 þ ð1  pÞd 2 þ ud, so that
eðrqÞtðu þ dÞ  ud  e2ðrqÞt ¼ 2t
ð21:2Þ
Equations (21.1) and (21.2) impose two conditions on p, u, and d. A third condition
used by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) is3
u ¼ 1=d

ð21:7Þ
The variable a is sometimes referred to as the growth factor. Equations (21.4) to (21.7)
are consistent with the formulas in Sections 13.8 and 13.11.
Tree of Asset Prices
Figure 21.2 shows the complete tree of asset prices that is considered when the binomial
model is used with four time steps. At time zero, the asset price, S0, is known. At time
t, there are two possible asset prices, S0u and S0d; at time 2t, there are three possible
asset prices, S0u2, S0, and S0d2; and so on. In general, at time i t, we consider i þ 1
asset prices. These are
S0ujd ij;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; i
Note that the relationship u ¼ 1=d is used in computing the asset price at each node of
the tree in Figure 21.2. For example, the asset price when j ¼ 2 and i ¼ 3 is
S0u2d ¼ S0u. Note also that the tree recombines in the sense that an up movement
followed by a down movement leads to the same asset price as a down movement
followed by an up movement.
Working Backward through the Tree
Options are evaluated by starting at the end of the tree (time T) and working backward.
The value of the option is known at time T. For example, a put option is worth
maxðK  ST; 0Þ and a call option is worth maxðST  K; 0Þ, where ST is the asset price at
3 See J. C. Cox, S. A. Ross, and M. Rubinstein, ‘‘Option Pricing: A Simpliﬁed Approach,’’ Journal of
Financial Economics, 7 (October 1979), 229–63.
4 To see this, we note that equations (21.4) and (21.7) satisfy the conditions in equations (21.1) and (21.3)
exactly. The exponential function ex can be expanded as 1 þ x þ x2=2 þ    . When terms of higher order than
t are ignored, equation (21.5) implies that u ¼ 1 þ 

that equation (21.2) is satisﬁed when terms of higher order than t are ignored.

time T and K is the strike price. Because a risk-neutral world is being assumed, the
value at each node at time T  t can be calculated as the expected value at time T
discounted at rate r for a time period t. Similarly, the value at each node at time
T  2t can be calculated as the expected value at time T  t discounted for a time
period t at rate r, and so on. If the option is American, it is necessary to check at each
node to see whether early exercise is preferable to holding the option for a further time
period t. Eventually, by working back through all the nodes, we are able to obtain the
value of the option at time zero.
Example 21.1
Consider a 5-month American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock when
the stock price is $50, the strike price is $50, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per
annum, and the volatility is 40% per annum. With our usual notation, this means
that S0 ¼ 50, K ¼ 50, r ¼ 0:10,  ¼ 0:40, T ¼ 0:4167, and q ¼ 0. Suppose that we
divide the life of the option into ﬁve intervals of length 1 month (¼ 0:0833 year)
for the purposes of constructing a binomial tree. Then t ¼ 0:0833 and using
equations (21.4) to (21.7) gives
u ¼ e ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

Figure 21.3 shows the binomial tree produced by DerivaGem. At each node there
are two numbers. The top one shows the stock price at the node; the lower one
shows the value of the option at the node. The probability of an up movement is
always 0.5073; the probability of a down movement is always 0.4927.

The stock price at the jth node (j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; i) at time i t (i ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; 5) is
calculated as S0ujd ij. For example, the stock price at node A (i ¼ 4; j ¼ 1) (i.e.,
the second node up at the end of the fourth time step) is 50  1:1224  0:89093 ¼
$39:69. The option prices at the ﬁnal nodes are calculated as maxðK  ST; 0Þ. For
example, the option price at node G is 50:00  35:36 ¼ 14:64. The option prices at
the penultimate nodes are calculated from the option prices at the ﬁnal nodes.
First, we assume no exercise of the option at the nodes. This means that the
option price is calculated as the present value of the expected option price one
time step later. For example, at node E, the option price is calculated as
ð0:5073  0 þ 0:4927  5:45Þe0:100:0833 ¼ 2:66

CHAPTER 21

We then check to see if early exercise is preferable to waiting. At node E, early
exercise would give a value for the option of zero because both the stock price and
strike price are $50. Clearly it is best to wait. The correct value for the option at
node E is therefore $2.66. At node A, it is a diﬀerent story. If the option is
exercised, it is worth $50:00  $39:69, or $10.31. This is more than $9.90. If node
A is reached, then the option should be exercised and the correct value for the
option at node A is $10.31.
Option prices at earlier nodes are calculated in a similar way. Note that it is not
always best to exercise an option early when it is in the money. Consider node B.
If the option is exercised, it is worth $50:00  $39:69, or $10.31. However, if it is
not exercised, it is worth
ð0:5073  6:38 þ 0:4927  14:64Þe0:100:0833 ¼ 10:36
The option should, therefore, not be exercised at this node, and the correct option
value at the node is $10.36.
Working back through the tree, the value of the option at the initial node is
$4.49. This is our numerical estimate for the option’s current value. In practice, a
smaller value of t, and many more nodes, would be used. DerivaGem shows
that with 30, 50, 100, and 500 time steps we get values for the option of 4.263,
4.272, 4.278, and 4.283.
Expressing the Approach Algebraically
Suppose that the life of an American option is divided into N subintervals of length t.
We will refer to the jth node at time i t as the ði; jÞ node, where 0 6 i 6 N and
0 6 j 6 iÞ. This means that the lowest node at time i t is ði; 0Þ, the next lowest is ði; 1Þ,
and so on. Deﬁne fi;j as the value of the option at the ði; jÞ node. The price of the
underlying asset at the ði; jÞ node is S0ujd ij. If the option is a call, its value at time T
(the expiration date) is maxðST  K; 0Þ, so that
fN;j ¼ maxðS0ujd Nj  K; 0Þ;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; N
If the option is a put, its value at time T is maxðK  ST; 0Þ, so that
fN;j ¼ maxðK  S0ujd Nj; 0Þ;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; N
There is a probability p of moving from the ði; jÞ node at time i t to the ði þ 1; j þ 1Þ

time i t captures not only the eﬀect of early exercise possibilities at time i t, but also
the eﬀect of early exercise at subsequent times.
In the limit as t tends to zero, an exact value for the American put is obtained. In
practice, N ¼ 30 usually gives reasonable results. Figure 21.4 shows the convergence of
the option price in Example 21.1. This ﬁgure was calculated using the Application
Builder functions provided with the DerivaGem software (see Sample Application A).
Estimating Delta and Other Greek Letters
It will be recalled that the delta () of an option is the rate of change of its price with
respect to the underlying stock price. It can be calculated as
f
S
where S is a small change in the asset price and f is the corresponding small change
in the option price. At time t, we have an estimate f1;1 for the option price when the
asset price is S0u and an estimate f1;0 for the option price when the asset price is S0d.
This means that, when S ¼ S0u  S0d; f ¼ f1;1  f1;0. Therefore an estimate of
delta at time t is
 ¼ f1;1  f1;0
S0u  S0d
ð21:8Þ
To determine gamma (), note that we have two estimates of  at time 2t.
When S ¼ ðS0u2 þ S0Þ=2 (halfway between the second and third node), delta is
ðf2;2  f2;1Þ=ðS0u2  S0Þ; when S ¼ ðS0 þ S0d2Þ=2 (halfway between the ﬁrst and second
node), delta is ðf2;1  f2;0Þ=ðS0  S0d2Þ. The diﬀerence between the two values of S is h,

Gamma is the change in delta divided by h:

These procedures provide estimates of delta at time t and of gamma at time 2t. In
practice, they are usually used as estimates of delta and gamma at time zero as well.5
A further hedge parameter that can be obtained directly from the tree is theta ().
This is the rate of change of the option price with time when all else is kept constant.
The value of the option at time zero is f0;0 and at time 2t it is f2;1. An estimate of
theta is therefore
 ¼ f2;1  f0;0
2t
ð21:10Þ
Vega can be calculated by making a small change, , in the volatility and constructing
a new tree to obtain a new value of the option. (The number of time steps should be
kept the same.) The estimate of vega is
V ¼ f   f

where f and f  are the estimates of the option price from the original and the new tree,
respectively. Rho can be calculated similarly.
Example 21.2
Consider again Example 21.1. From Figure 21.3, f1;0 ¼ 6:96 and f1;1 ¼ 2:16.
Equation (21.8) gives an estimate for delta of
2:16  6:96
56:12  44:55 ¼ 0:41
From equation (21.9), an estimate of the gamma of the option can be obtained
from the values at nodes B, C, and F as
½ð0:64  3:77Þ=ð62:99  50:00Þ  ½ð3:77  10:36Þ=ð50:00  39:69Þ
11:65
¼ 0:03
From equation (21.10), an estimate of the theta of the option can be obtained
from the values at nodes D and C as
3:77  4:49
0:1667
¼ 4:3
per year
or 0:012 per calendar day. These are only rough estimates. They become pro-
gressively better as the number of time steps on the tree is increased. Using 50 time
steps, DerivaGem provides estimates of –0.415, 0.034, and 0:0117 for delta,
gamma, and theta, respectively. By making small changes to parameters and
recomputing values, vega and rho are estimated as 0.123 and 0:072, respectively.
5 If slightly more accuracy is required for delta and gamma, we can start the binomial tree at time 2t and
assume that the stock price is S0 at this time. This leads to the option price being calculated for three diﬀerent
stock prices at time zero.

21.2
USING THE BINOMIAL TREE FOR OPTIONS ON INDICES,
CURRENCIES, AND FUTURES CONTRACTS
As explained in Chapters 13, 17 and 18, stock indices, currencies, and futures contracts
can, for the purposes of option valuation, be considered as assets providing known
yields. For a stock index, the relevant yield is the dividend yield on the stock portfolio
underlying the index; in the case of a currency, it is the foreign risk-free interest rate; in the
case of a futures contract, it is the domestic risk-free interest rate. The binomial tree
approach can therefore be used to value options on stock indices, currencies, and futures
contracts provided that q in equation (21.7) is interpreted appropriately.
Example 21.3
Consider a 4-month American call option on index futures where the current
futures price is 300, the exercise price is 300, the risk-free interest rate is 8% per

case, F0 ¼ 300, K ¼ 300, r ¼ 0:08,  ¼ 0:3, T ¼ 0:3333, and t ¼ 0:0833. Because
a futures contract is analogous to a stock paying dividends at a rate r, q should be

exchange rate (USD per GBP) is 1.6100, the strike price is 1.6000, the US risk-free

21.3
BINOMIAL MODEL FOR A DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK
We now move on to the more tricky issue of how the binomial model can be used for a
dividend-paying stock. As in Chapter 15, the word ‘‘dividend’’ will, for the purposes of
our discussion, be used to refer to the reduction in the stock price on the ex-dividend
date as a result of the dividend.
Known Dividend Yield
For long-life stock options, it is sometimes assumed for convenience that there is a
known continuous dividend yield of q on the stock. The options can then be valued in
the same way as options on a stock index.
For more accuracy, known dividend yields can be assumed to be paid discretely.
Suppose that there is a single dividend, and the dividend yield (i.e., the dividend as a
percentage of the stock price) is known. The parameters u, d, and p can be calculated as
though no dividends are expected. If the time i t is prior to the stock going ex-
dividend, the nodes on the tree correspond to stock prices
S0ujd ij;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; i
If the time i t is after the stock goes ex-dividend, the nodes correspond to stock prices
S0ð1  Þujd ij;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; i
where  is the dividend yield. The tree has the form shown in Figure 21.7. Several known
dividend yields during the life of an option can be dealt with similarly. If i is the total
dividend yield associated with all ex-dividend dates between time zero and time i t, the
nodes at time i t correspond to stock prices
S0ð1  iÞujd ij
482
CHAPTER 21

Known Dollar Dividend
In some situations, particularly when the life of the option is short, the most realistic
assumption is that the dollar amount of the dividend rather than the dividend yield is
known in advance. If the volatility of the stock, , is assumed constant, the tree then
takes the form shown in Figure 21.8. It does not recombine, which means that the
number of nodes that have to be evaluated is liable to become very large. Suppose that
there is only one dividend, that the ex-dividend date, , is between k t and ðk þ 1Þ t,
and that the dollar amount of the dividend is D. When i 6 k, the nodes on the tree at
time i t correspond to stock prices
S0ujd ij;
j ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; i
as before. When i ¼ k þ 1, the nodes on the tree correspond to stock prices
S0ujd ij  D;
j ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; i
When i ¼ k þ 2, the nodes on the tree correspond to stock prices
ðS0ujd i1j  DÞu
and
ðS0ujd i1j  DÞd
for j ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; i  1, so that there are 2i rather than i þ 1 nodes. When i ¼ k þ m,
there are mðk þ 2Þ rather than k þ m þ 1 nodes. The number of nodes expands even
faster when there are several ex-dividend dates during the option’s life.

Section 15.12 explained that European options on dividend-paying stocks are valued
by assuming that the stock price has two components: a part that is uncertain and a part
that is the present value of dividends paid during the life of the option. It outlined a
number of reasons why practitioners ﬁnd this a sensible assumption. American options
clearly have to be valued using the same model as European options. (Otherwise the
prices of American options that should never be exercised early will not be the same as
the prices of European options.) American options on stocks paying known dividends
are therefore in practice valued using the approach in Section 15.12. As it happens, this
solves the node-proliferation problem in Figure 21.8.
Suppose that there is only one ex-dividend date, , during the life of the option and that
k t 6  6 ðk þ 1Þ t. The value S  of the uncertain component (i.e., the component not
used to pay dividends) at time i t is given by
S  ¼ S
when i t > 
and
S  ¼ S  DerðitÞ
when i t 6 
where D is the dividend. Deﬁne  as the volatility of S . The parameters p, u, and d
can be calculated from equations (21.4) to (21.7) with  replaced by  and a tree can be
constructed in the usual way to model S .6 By adding to the stock price at each node,
the present value of future dividends (if any), the tree can be converted into another tree

6 As discussed in Section 15.12, the diﬀerence between  and  does not usually have to be considered
explicitly because in practice analysts normally work with volatilities implied from market prices using their
models and these are -volatilities.

that models S. Suppose that S 
0 is the value of S  at time zero. At time i t, the nodes
on this tree correspond to the stock prices
S 
0 ujd ij þ Derði tÞ;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; i
when i t <  and
S 
0 ujd ij;
j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; i
when i t > . This approach, which leads to a situation where the tree recombines so
that there are i þ 1 nodes at time i t, can be generalized in a straightforward way to
deal with the situation where there are several dividends.
Example 21.5
Consider a 5-month American put option on a stock that is expected to pay a
single dividend of $2.06 during the life of the option. The initial stock price is $52,
the strike price is $50, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, the volatility is
40% per annum, and the ex-dividend date is in 31
2 months.
We ﬁrst construct a tree to model S , the stock price less the present value of
future dividends during the life of the option. At time zero, the present value of
the dividend is
2:06  e0:29170:1 ¼ 2:00
The initial value of S  is therefore 50.00. If we assume that the 40% per annum
volatility refers to S , then Figure 21.3 provides a binomial tree for S . (This is
because S  has the same initial value and volatility as the stock price that
Figure 21.3 was based upon.) Adding the present value of the dividend at each
node leads to Figure 21.9, which is a binomial model for S. The probabilities at
each node are, as in Figure 21.3, 0.5073 for an up movement and 0.4927 for a
down movement. Working back through the tree in the usual way gives the
option price as $4.44. (Using 50 time steps, DerivaGem gives a value for the
option of 4.202; using 100 steps it gives 4.212.)
Control Variate Technique
A technique known as the control variate technique can improve the accuracy of the
pricing of an American option.7 This involves using the same tree to calculate the value
of both the American option, fA, and the corresponding European option, fE. The
Black–Scholes–Merton price of the European option, fBSM, is also calculated. The
error when the tree is used to price the European option, fBSM  fE, is assumed equal
to the error when the tree is used to price the American option. This gives the estimate
of the price of the American option as
fA þ ðfBSM  fEÞ
To illustrate this approach, Figure 21.10 values the option in Figure 21.3 on the
assumption that it is European. The price obtained, fE, is $4.32. From the Black–
Scholes–Merton formula, the true European price of the option, fBSM, is $4.08. The
7 See J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘The Use of the Control Variate Technique in Option Pricing,’’ Journal of
Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 23 (September 1988): 237–51.
Basic Numerical Procedures
485

estimate of the American price in Figure 21.3, fA, is $4.49. The control variate estimate
of the American price, therefore, is
4:49 þ ð4:08  4:32Þ ¼ 4:25
A good estimate of the American price, calculated using 100 steps, is 4.278. The control
variate approach does, therefore, produce a considerable improvement over the basic
tree estimate of 4.49 in this case.
The control variate technique in eﬀect involves using the tree to calculate the
diﬀerence between the European and the American price rather than the American
price itself. We give a further application of the control variate technique when we
discuss Monte Carlo simulation later in the chapter.

Rubinstein approach that the probabilities are always 0.5 regardless of the value of  or
the number of time steps.8 Its disadvantage is that it is not quite as straightforward to
calculate delta, gamma, and theta from the tree because the tree is no longer centered at
the initial stock price.

Consider a 9-month American call option on a foreign currency. The foreign
currency is worth 0.7900 when measured in the domestic currency, the strike price

Trinomial Trees
Trinomial trees can be used as an alternative to binomial trees. The general form of the
tree is as shown in Figure 21.12. Suppose that pu, pm, and pd are the probabilities of
up, middle, and down movements at each node and t is the length of the time step.

exercising and the value of continuing. The value of continuing is
ertðpufu þ pmfm þ pdfdÞ
where fu, fm, and fd are the values of the option at the subsequent up, middle, and
down nodes, respectively. The trinomial tree approach proves to be equivalent to the
explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method, which will be described in Section 21.8.
Figlewski and Gao have proposed an enhancement of the trinomial tree method,
which they call the adaptive mesh model. In this, a high-resolution (small-t) tree is
grafted onto a low-resolution (large-t) tree.9 When valuing a regular American
option, high resolution is most useful for the parts of the tree close to the strike price
at the end of the life of the option.
21.5
TIME-DEPENDENT PARAMETERS
Up to now we have assumed that r, q, rf, and  are constants. In practice, they are
usually assumed to be time dependent. The values of these variables between times t
and t þ t are assumed to be equal to their forward values.10
To make r and q (or rf) a function of time in a Cox–Ross–Rubinstein binomial tree,
we set
a ¼ e½fðtÞgðtÞt
ð21:11Þ
for nodes at time t, where fðtÞ is the forward interest rate between times t and t þ t
and gðtÞ is the forward value of q (or rf) between these times. This does not change the
geometry of the tree because u and d do not depend on a. The probabilities on the
branches emanating from nodes at time t are:11
p ¼ e½fðtÞgðtÞt  d
u  d
ð21:12Þ
1  p ¼ u  e½fðtÞgðtÞt
u  d
The rest of the way that we use the tree is the same as before, except that when
discounting between times t and t þ t we use fðtÞ.
Making the volatility, , a function of time in a binomial tree is more diﬃcult. Suppose
ðtÞ is the volatility used to price an option with maturity t. One approach is to make the
length of each time step inversely proportional to the average variance rate during the
time step. The values of u and d are then the same everywhere and the tree recombines.
Deﬁne the V ¼ ðTÞ2T, where T is the life of the tree, and deﬁne ti as the end of the ith
time step. For N time steps, we choose ti to satisfy ðtiÞ2ti ¼ iV=N and set u ¼ e
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
V=N
p
with d ¼ 1=u. The parameter p is deﬁned in terms of u, d, r, and q as for a constant
volatility. This procedure can be combined with the procedure just mentioned for dealing

10 The forward dividend yield and forward variance rate are calculated in the same way as the forward
interest rate. (The variance rate is the square of the volatility.)

with nonconstant interest rates so that both interest rates and volatilities are time-
dependent.

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
We now explain Monte Carlo simulation, a quite diﬀerent approach for valuing
derivatives from binomial trees. Business Snapshot 21.1 illustrates the random sampling
idea underlying Monte Carlo simulation by showing how a simple Excel program can
be constructed to estimate .
When used to value an option, Monte Carlo simulation uses the risk-neutral
valuation result. We sample paths to obtain the expected payoﬀin a risk-neutral world
Business Snapshot 21.1
Calculating Pi with Monte Carlo Simulation
Suppose the sides of the square in Figure 21.13 are one unit in length. Imagine that
you ﬁre darts randomly at the square and calculate the percentage that lie in the
circle. What should you ﬁnd? The square has an area of 1.0 and the circle has a radius
of 0.5 The area of the circle is  times the radius squared or =4. It follows that the
proportion of darts that lie in the circle should be =4. We can estimate  by
multiplying the proportion that lie in the circle by 4.
We can use an Excel spreadsheet to simulate the dart throwing as illustrated in
Table 21.1. We deﬁne both cell A1 and cell B1 as ¼RAND( ). A1 and B1 are random
numbers between 0 and 1 and deﬁne how far to the right and how high up the dart
lands in the square in Figure 21.13. We then deﬁne cell C1 as
¼IF((A10.5)^2þ(B10.5)^2<0.5^2,4,0)
This has the eﬀect of setting C1 equal to 4 if the dart lies in the circle and 0 otherwise.
Deﬁne the next 99 rows of the spreadsheet similarly to the ﬁrst one. (This is a
‘‘select and drag’’ operation in Excel.) Deﬁne C102 as ¼AVERAGE(C1:C100) and
C103 as ¼STDEV(C1:C100). C102 (which is 3.04 in Table 21.1) is an estimate of 
calculated from 100 random trials. C103 is the standard deviation of our results and
as we will see in Example 21.7 can be used to assess the accuracy of the estimate.
Increasing the number of trials improves accuracy—but convergence to the correct
value of 3.14159 is slow.

and then discount this payoﬀat the risk-free rate. Consider a derivative dependent on a
single market variable S that provides a payoﬀat time T. Assuming that interest rates
are constant, we can value the derivative as follows:
1. Sample a random path for S in a risk-neutral world.
2. Calculate the payoﬀfrom the derivative.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to get many sample values of the payoﬀfrom the derivative
in a risk-neutral world.
4. Calculate the mean of the sample payoﬀs to get an estimate of the expected payoﬀ
in a risk-neutral world.
5. Discount this expected payoﬀat the risk-free rate to get an estimate of the value of
the derivative.
This is illustrated by the Monte Carlo worksheet in DerivaGem 3.00.
Suppose that the process followed by the underlying market variable in a risk-neutral
world is
dS ¼ ^S dt þ S dz
ð21:13Þ
where dz is a Wiener process, ^ is the expected return in a risk-neutral world, and  is
the volatility.12 To simulate the path followed by S, we can divide the life of the
derivative into N short intervals of length t and approximate equation (21.13) as
Sðt þ tÞ  SðtÞ ¼ ^SðtÞ t þ SðtÞ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
ð21:14Þ
where SðtÞ denotes the value of S at time t,  is a random sample from a normal
distribution with mean zero and standard deviation of 1.0. This enables the value of S
at time t to be calculated from the initial value of S, the value at time 2 t to be
calculated from the value at time t, and so on. An illustration of the procedure is in
Section 14.3. One simulation trial involves constructing a complete path for S using N
random samples from a normal distribution.

This equation can be used to value derivatives that provide a nonstandard payoﬀat
time T. As shown in Business Snapshot 21.2, it can also be used to check the Black–
Scholes–Merton formulas.
The key advantage of Monte Carlo simulation is that it can be used when the
payoﬀdepends on the path followed by the underlying variable S as well as when it
depends only on the ﬁnal value of S. (For example, it can be used when payoﬀs
depend on the average value of S between time 0 and time T.) Payoﬀs can occur at
several times during the life of the derivative rather than all at the end. Any stochastic
process for S can be accommodated. As will be shown shortly, the procedure can also
be extended to accommodate situations where the payoﬀfrom the derivative depends
on several underlying market variables. The drawbacks of Monte Carlo simulation are
that it is computationally very time consuming and cannot easily handle situations
where there are early exercise opportunities.14
Derivatives Dependent on More than One Market Variable
We discussed correlated stochastic processes in Section 14.5. Consider the situation
where the payoﬀfrom a derivative depends on n variables i (1 6 i 6 n). Deﬁne si as the
volatility of i, ^mi as the expected growth rate of i in a risk-neutral world, and 	ik as the
correlation between the Wiener processes driving i and k.15 As in the single-variable
case, the life of the derivative must be divided into N subintervals of length t. The
13 By contrast, equation (21.14) is exactly true only in the limit as t tends to zero.
14 As discussed in Chapter 27, a number of researchers have suggested ways Monte Carlo simulation can be
extended to value American options.
15 Note that si, ^mi, and 	ik are not necessarily constant; they may depend on the i.

discrete version of the process for i is then

ð21:18Þ
where i is a random sample from a standard normal distribution. The coeﬃcient of
correlation between i and k is 	ik (1 6 i; k 6 n). One simulation trial involves obtain-
ing N samples of the i (1 6 i 6 n) from a multivariate standardized normal distribu-
tion. These are substituted into equation (21.18) to produce simulated paths for each i,
thereby enabling a sample value for the derivative to be calculated.

Checking Black–Scholes–Merton in Excel
The Black–Scholes–Merton formula for a European call option can be checked by
using a binomial tree with a very large number of time steps. An alternative way of
checking it is to use Monte Carlo simulation. Table 21.2 shows a spreadsheet that can
be constructed. The cells C2, D2, E2, F2, and G2 contain S0, K, r, , and T, respectively.
Cells D4, E4, and F4 calculate d1, d2, and the Black–Scholes–Merton price, respec-
tively. (The Black–Scholes–Merton price is 4.817 in the sample spreadsheet.)
NORMSINV is the inverse cumulative function for the standard normal distribu-
tion. It follows that NORMSINV(RAND())gives a random sample from a standard
normal distribution. We set cell A1 as
¼$C$2*EXP(($E$2$F$2*$F$2/2)*$G$2þ$F$2*NORMSINV(RAND( ))*SQRT($G$2))
This corresponds to equation (21.17) and is a random sample from the set of all stock
prices at time T. We set cell B1 as
¼EXP($E$2*$G$2)*MAX(A1$D$2,0)
This is the present value of the payoﬀfrom a call option. We deﬁne the next 999 rows
of the spreadsheet similarly to the ﬁrst one. (This is a ‘‘select and drag’’ operation in
Excel.) Deﬁne B1002 as AVERAGE(B1:B1000), which is 4.98 in the sample spread-
sheet. This is an estimate of the value of the option and should be not too far from
the Black–Scholes–Merton price. B1003 is deﬁned as STDEV(B1:B1000). As we shall
see in Example 21.8, it can be used to assess the accuracy of the estimate.

CHAPTER 21

Generating the Random Samples from Normal Distributions
The instruction ¼NORMSINV(RAND( )) in Excel can be used to generate a random
sample from a standard normal distribution, as in Business Snapshot 21.2. When two
correlated samples 1 and 2 from standard normal distributions are required, an
appropriate procedure is as follows. Independent samples x1 and x2 from a univariate
standardized normal distribution are obtained as just described. The required samples
1 and 2 are then calculated as follows:
1 ¼ x1
2 ¼ 	x1 þ x2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

where 	 is the coeﬃcient of correlation.
More generally, consider the situation where we require n correlated samples from
normal distributions with the correlation between sample i and sample j being 	ij. We
ﬁrst sample n independent variables xi (1 6 i 6 n), from univariate standardized
normal distributions. The required samples, i (1 6 i 6 n), are then deﬁned as follows:
1 ¼ 
11x1

22x2
3 ¼ 
31x1 þ

ð21:19Þ
and so on. We choose the coeﬃcients 
ij so that the correlations and variances are
correct. This can be done step by step as follows. Set 
11 ¼ 1; choose 
21 so that

21
11 ¼ 	21; choose

This procedure is known as the Cholesky decomposition.
Number of Trials
The accuracy of the result given by Monte Carlo simulation depends on the number of
trials. It is usual to calculate the standard deviation as well as the mean of the
discounted payoﬀs given by the simulation trials. Denote the mean by  and the
standard deviation by !. The variable  is the simulation’s estimate of the value of
the derivative. The standard error of the estimate is
!ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
M
p
where M is the number of trials. A 95% conﬁdence interval for the price f of the
derivative is therefore given by
  1:96!
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
M
p
< f <  þ 1:96!
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
M

This shows that uncertainty about the value of the derivative is inversely proportional
to the square root of the number of trials. To double the accuracy of a simulation, we

’s do not have real solutions, the assumed correlation structure is internally

must quadruple the number of trials; to increase the accuracy by a factor of 10, the
number of trials must increase by a factor of 100; and so on.
Example 21.7
In Table 21.1,  is calculated as the average of 100 numbers. The standard
deviation of the numbers is 1.69. In this case, ! ¼ 1:69 and M ¼ 100, so that
the standard error of the estimate is 1:69=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
100
p
¼ 0:169. The spreadsheet
therefore gives a 95% conﬁdence interval for  as ð3:04  1:96  0:169Þ to
ð3:04 þ 1:96  0:169Þ or 2.71 to 3.37. (The correct value of 3.14159 lies within
this conﬁdence interval.)
Example 21.8
In Table 21.2, the value of the option is calculated as the average of 1000
numbers. The standard deviation of the numbers is 7.68. In this case, ! ¼ 7:68
and M ¼ 1000. The standard error of the estimate is 7:68=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1000
p
¼ 0:24. The
spreadsheet therefore gives a 95% conﬁdence interval for the option value as
ð4:98  1:96  0:24Þ to ð4:98 þ 1:96  0:24Þ, or 4.51 to 5.45. (The Black–Scholes–
Merton price, 4.817, lies within this conﬁdence interval.)
Sampling through a Tree
Instead of implementing Monte Carlo simulation by randomly sampling from the
stochastic process for an underlying variable, we can use an N-step binomial tree and
sample from the 2N paths that are possible. Suppose we have a binomial tree where the
probability of an ‘‘up’’ movement is 0.6. The procedure for sampling a random path
through the tree is as follows. At each node, we sample a random number between 0
and 1. If the number is less than 0.4, we take the down branch. If it is greater than 0.4,
we take the up branch. Once we have a complete path from the initial node to the end of
the tree, we can calculate a payoﬀ. This completes the ﬁrst trial. A similar procedure is
used to complete more trials. The mean of the payoﬀs is discounted at the risk-free rate
to get an estimate of the value of the derivative.17
Example 21.9
Suppose that the tree in Figure 21.3 is used to value an option that pays oﬀ
maxðSave  50; 0Þ, where Save is the average stock price during the 5 months (with
the ﬁrst and last stock price being included in the average). This is known as an
Asian option. When ten simulation trials are used one possible result is shown in
Table 21.3. The value of the option is calculated as the average payoﬀdiscounted at
the risk-free rate. In this case, the average payoﬀis $7.08 and the risk-free rate is
10% and so the calculated value is 7:08e0:15=12 ¼ 6:79. (This illustrates the
methodology. In practice, we would have to use more time steps on the tree and
many more simulation trials to get an accurate answer.)
Calculating the Greek Letters
The Greek letters discussed in Chapter 19 can be calculated using Monte Carlo
simulation. Suppose that we are interested in the partial derivative of f with respect
17 See D. Mintz, ‘‘Less is More,’’ Risk, July 1997: 42–45, for a discussion of how sampling through a tree can
be made eﬃcient.
496
CHAPTER 21

to x, where f is the value of the derivative and x is the value of an underlying variable
or a parameter. First, Monte Carlo simulation is used in the usual way to calculate an
estimate ^f for the value of the derivative. A small increase x is then made in the value
of x, and a new value for the derivative,
^f , is calculated in the same way as ^f. An
estimate for the hedge parameter is given by
^f   ^f
x
In order to minimize the standard error of the estimate, the number of time intervals, N,
the random samples that are used, and the number of trials, M, should be the same for
calculating both ^f and ^f .
Applications
Monte Carlo simulation tends to be numerically more eﬃcient than other procedures
when there are three or more stochastic variables. This is because the time taken to
carry out a Monte Carlo simulation increases approximately linearly with the number
of variables, whereas the time taken for most other procedures increases exponentially
with the number of variables. One advantage of Monte Carlo simulation is that it can
provide a standard error for the estimates that it makes. Another is that it is an
approach that can accommodate complex payoﬀs and complex stochastic processes.
Also, it can be used when the payoﬀdepends on some function of the whole path
followed by a variable, not just its terminal value.
21.7
VARIANCE REDUCTION PROCEDURES
If the stochastic processes for the variables underlying a derivative are simulated as
indicated in equations (21.13) to (21.18), a very large number of trials is usually

necessary to estimate the value of the derivative with reasonable accuracy. This is very
expensive in terms of computation time. In this section, we examine a number of
variance reduction procedures that can lead to dramatic savings in computation time.
Antithetic Variable Technique
In the antithetic variable technique, a simulation trial involves calculating two values of
the derivative. The ﬁrst value f1 is calculated in the usual way; the second value f2 is
calculated by changing the sign of all the random samples from standard normal
distributions. (If  is a sample used to calculate f1, then  is the corresponding sample
used to calculate f2.) The sample value of the derivative calculated from a simulation
trial is the average of f1 and f2. This works well because when one value is above the
true value, the other tends to be below, and vice versa.
Denote f as the average of f1 and f2:
f ¼ f1 þ f2
2
The ﬁnal estimate of the value of the derivative is the average of the f ’s. If ! is the
standard deviation of the f ’s, and M is the number of simulation trials (i.e., the number
of pairs of values calculated), then the standard error of the estimate is
!=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
M
p
This is usually much less than the standard error calculated using 2M random trials.
Control Variate Technique
We have already given one example of the control variate technique in connection with
the use of trees to value American options (see Section 21.3). The control variate
technique is applicable when there are two similar derivatives, A and B. Derivative A is
the one being valued; derivative B is similar to derivative A and has an analytic solution
available. Two simulations using the same random number streams and the same t are
carried out in parallel. The ﬁrst is used to obtain an estimate f 
A of the value of A; the
second is used to obtain an estimate f 
B , of the value of B. A better estimate fA of the
value of A is then obtained using the formula
fA ¼ f 
A  f 
B þ fB
ð21:20Þ
where fB is the known true value of B calculated analytically. Hull and White provide
an example of the use of the control variate technique when evaluating the eﬀect of
stochastic volatility on the price of a European call option.18 In this case, A is the
option assuming stochastic volatility and B is the option assuming constant volatility.
Importance Sampling
Importance sampling is best explained with an example. Suppose that we wish to
calculate the price of a deep-out-of-the-money European call option with strike

price K and maturity T. If we sample values for the underlying asset price at time T in the
usual way, most of the paths will lead to zero payoﬀ. This is a waste of computation time
because the zero-payoﬀpaths contribute very little to the determination of the value of
the option. We therefore try to choose only important paths, that is, paths where the
stock price is above K at maturity.
Suppose F is the unconditional probability distribution function for the stock price
at time T and q, the probability of the stock price being greater than K at maturity, is
known analytically. Then G ¼ F=q is the probability distribution of the stock price
conditional on the stock price being greater than K. To implement importance
sampling, we sample from G rather than F. The estimate of the value of the option
is the average discounted payoﬀmultiplied by q.
Stratiﬁed Sampling
Sampling representative values rather than random values from a probability distribu-
tion usually gives more accuracy. Stratiﬁed sampling is a way of doing this. Suppose we
wish to take 1000 samples from a probability distribution. We would divide the
distribution into 1000 equally likely intervals and choose a representative value
(typically the mean or median) for each interval.
In the case of a standard normal distribution when there are n intervals, we can
calculate the representative value for the ith interval as
N 1
i  0:5
n

where N 1 is the inverse cumulative normal distribution. For example, when n ¼ 4 the
representative values corresponding to the four intervals are N 1ð0:125Þ, N 1ð0:375Þ,
N 1ð0:625Þ, N 1ð0:875Þ. The function N 1 can be calculated using the NORMSINV
function in Excel.
Moment Matching
Moment matching involves adjusting the samples taken from a standardized normal
distribution so that the ﬁrst, second, and possibly higher moments are matched.
Suppose that we sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1 to calculate the change in the value of a particular variable over a particular
time period. Suppose that the samples are i (1 6 i 6 n). To match the ﬁrst two
moments, we calculate the mean of the samples, m, and the standard deviation of
the samples, s. We then deﬁne adjusted samples 
i (1 6 i 6 n) as

i ¼ i  m
s
These adjusted samples have the correct mean of 0 and the correct standard deviation
of 1.0. We use the adjusted samples for all calculations.
Moment matching saves computation time, but can lead to memory problems
because every number sampled must be stored until the end of the simulation. Moment
matching is sometimes termed quadratic resampling. It is often used in conjunction with
the antithetic variable technique. Because the latter automatically matches all odd

499

moments, the goal of moment matching then becomes that of matching the second
moment and, possibly, the fourth moment.
Using Quasi-Random Sequences
A quasi-random sequence (also called a low-discrepancy sequence) is a sequence of
representative samples from a probability distribution.19 Descriptions of the use of
quasi-random sequences appear in Brotherton-Ratcliﬀe, and Press et al.20 Quasi-random
sequences can have the desirable property that they lead to the standard error of an
estimate being proportional to 1=M rather than 1=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
M
p
, where M is the sample size.
Quasi-random sampling is similar to stratiﬁed sampling. The objective is to sample
representative values for the underlying variables. In stratiﬁed sampling, it is assumed
that we know in advance how many samples will be taken. A quasi-random sampling
procedure is more ﬂexible. The samples are taken in such a way that we are always
‘‘ﬁlling in’’ gaps between existing samples. At each stage of the simulation, the sampled
points are roughly evenly spaced throughout the probability space.
Figure 21.14 shows points generated in two dimensions using a procedure by Sobol’.21
It can be seen that successive points do tend to ﬁll in the gaps left by previous points.
21.8
FINITE DIFFERENCE METHODS
Finite diﬀerence methods value a derivative by solving the diﬀerential equation that the
derivative satisﬁes. The diﬀerential equation is converted into a set of diﬀerence
equations, and the diﬀerence equations are solved iteratively.
To illustrate the approach, we consider how it might be used to value an American
put option on a stock paying a dividend yield of q. The diﬀerential equation that the
option must satisfy is, from equation (17.6),
@f
@t þ ðr  qÞS @f
@S þ 1
22S 2 @2f
@S 2 ¼ rf
ð21:21Þ
Suppose that the life of the option is T. We divide this into N equally spaced intervals
of length t ¼ T=N. A total of N þ 1 times are therefore considered
0; t; 2 t; . . . ; T
Suppose that Smax is a stock price suﬃciently high that, when it is reached, the put has
virtually no value. We deﬁne S ¼ Smax=M and consider a total of M þ 1 equally
spaced stock prices:
0; S; 2 S; . . . ; Smax
The level Smax is chosen so that one of these is the current stock price.
19 The term quasi-random is a misnomer. A quasi-random sequence is totally deterministic.

CHAPTER 21

The time points and stock price points deﬁne a grid consisting of a total of
ðM þ 1ÞðN þ 1Þ points, as shown in Figure 21.15. We deﬁne the ði; jÞ point on the grid
as the point that corresponds to time i t and stock price j S. We will use the variable
fi;j to denote the value of the option at the ði; jÞ point.
Implicit Finite Difference Method
For an interior point ði; jÞ on the grid, @f=@S can be approximated as

use equation (21.27) to arrive at the value of f at all other points. First the points

Equations (21.31) are therefore M  1 simultaneous equations that can be solved for the
M  1 unknowns: fN1;1, fN1;2, . . . , fN1;M1.22 After this has been done, each value
22 This does not involve inverting a matrix. The j ¼ 1 equation in (21.31) can be used to express fN1;2 in
terms of fN1;1; the j ¼ 2 equation, when combined with the j ¼ 1 equation, can be used to express fN1;3 in
terms of fN1;1; and so on. The j ¼ M  2 equation, together with earlier equations, enables fN1;M1 to be
expressed in terms of fN1;1. The ﬁnal j ¼ M  1 equation can then be solved for fN1;1, which can then be
used to determine the other fN1;j.

of fN1;j is compared with K  j S. If fN1;j < K  j S, early exercise at time
T  t is optimal and fN1;j is set equal to K  j S. The nodes corresponding to
time T  2 t are handled in a similar way, and so on. Eventually, f0;1, f0;2, f0;3, . . . ,
f0;M1 are obtained. One of these is the option price of interest.
The control variate technique can be used in conjunction with ﬁnite diﬀerence
methods. The same grid is used to value an option similar to the one under
consideration but for which an analytic valuation is available. Equation (21.20) is
then used.
Example 21.10
Table 21.4 shows the result of using the implicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method as just
described for pricing the American put option in Example 21.1. Values of 20, 10,
and 5 were chosen for M, N, and S, respectively. Thus, the option price is
evaluated at $5 stock price intervals between $0 and $100 and at half-month time
intervals throughout the life of the option. The option price given by the grid is
$4.07. The same grid gives the price of the corresponding European option as
$3.91. The true European price given by the Black–Scholes–Merton formula is
$4.08. The control variate estimate of the American price is therefore
4:07 þ ð4:08  3:91Þ ¼ $4:24
Explicit Finite Difference Method
The implicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method has the advantage of being very robust. It always
converges to the solution of the diﬀerential equation as S and t approach zero.23 One
of the disadvantages of the implicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method is that M  1 simultaneous
equations have to be solved in order to calculate the fi;j from the fiþ1;j. The method can
be simpliﬁed if the values of @f=@S and @2f=@S 2 at point ði; jÞ on the grid are assumed to
be the same as at point ði þ 1; jÞ. Equations (21.24) and (21.26) then become

@S ¼ fiþ1;jþ1  fiþ1;j1

@2f
@S 2 ¼ fiþ1;jþ1 þ fiþ1;j1  2fiþ1;j

at time i t (i.e., fi;j1, fi;j, and fi;jþ1) and one value of the option at time ði þ 1Þ t
(i.e., fiþ1;j). The explicit method leads to equation (21.34), which gives a relationship

option at time ði þ 1Þ t (i.e., fiþ1;j1, fiþ1;j, fiþ1;jþ1).
Example 21.11
Table 21.5 shows the result of using the explicit version of the ﬁnite diﬀerence
method for pricing the American put option described in Example 21.1. As in
Example 21.10, values of 20, 10, and 5 were chosen for M, N, and S, respec-
tively. The option price given by the grid is $4.26.25
Change of Variable
When geometric Brownian motion is used for the underlying asset price, it is compu-
tationally more eﬃcient to use ﬁnite diﬀerence methods with ln S rather than S as the
underlying variable. Deﬁne Z ¼ ln S. Equation (21.21) becomes

The grid then evaluates the derivative for equally spaced values of Z rather than for
equally spaced values of S. The diﬀerence equation for the implicit method becomes

Relation to Trinomial Tree Approaches
The explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method is equivalent to the trinomial tree approach.26 In
the expressions for a
j, b
j, and c
j in equation (21.34), we can interpret terms as follows:
1
2ðr  qÞj t þ 1
22j 2t:
Probability of stock price decreasing from
j S to ðj  1ÞS in time t.
1  2j 2t:
Probability of stock price remaining unchanged at
j S in time t.
1
2ðr  qÞj t þ 1
22j 2t:
Probability of stock price increasing from
j S to ðj þ 1ÞS in time t.
This interpretation is illustrated in Figure 21.17. The three probabilities sum to unity.
They give the expected increase in the stock price in time t as ðr  qÞj S t ¼
ðr  qÞS t. This is the expected increase in a risk-neutral world. For small values

CHAPTER 21

of t, they also give the variance of the change in the stock price in time t as
2j 2S 2t ¼ 2S 2t. This corresponds to the stochastic process followed by S. The
value of f at time i t is calculated as the expected value of f at time ði þ 1Þ t in a
risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate.
For the explicit version of the ﬁnite diﬀerence method to work well, the three
‘‘probabilities’’
1
2ðr  qÞj t þ 1
22j 2t;
1  2j 2t
1
2ðr  qÞj t þ 1
22j 2t
should all be positive. In Example 21.11, 1  2j 2t is negative when j > 13 (i.e., when
S > 65). This explains the negative option prices and other inconsistencies in the top
left-hand part of Table 21.5. This example illustrates the main problem associated with
the explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method. Because the probabilities in the associated tree may
be negative, it does not necessarily produce results that converge to the solution of the
diﬀerential equation.27
When the change-of-variable approach is used (see equations (21.36) to (21.39)), the
probability that Z ¼ ln S will decrease by Z, stay the same, and increase by Z are

respectively. These movements in Z correspond to the stock price changing from S to
SeZ, S, and SeZ, respectively. If we set Z ¼ 

p
, then the tree and the
probabilities are identical to those for the trinomial tree approach discussed in
Section 21.4.
Other Finite Difference Methods
Researchers have proposed other ﬁnite diﬀerence methods which are in many circum-
stances more computationally eﬃcient than either the pure explicit or pure implicit
method.
In what is known as the hopscotch method, we alternate between the explicit and
implicit calculations as we move from node to node. This is illustrated in Figure 21.18.
At each time, we ﬁrst do all the calculations at the ‘‘explicit nodes’’ (E) in the usual way.
The ‘‘implicit nodes’’ (I) can then be handled without solving a set of simultaneous
equations because the values at the adjacent nodes have already been calculated.
27 J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘Valuing Derivative Securities Using the Explicit Finite Diﬀerence Method,’’
Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 25 (March 1990): 87–100, show how this problem can be
overcome. In the situation considered here it is suﬃcient to construct the grid in ln S rather than S to ensure
convergence.
Basic Numerical Procedures
509

In the Crank–Nicolson method, the estimate of
fiþ1;j  fi;j
t
is set equal to an average of that given by the implicit and the explicit methods.
Applications of Finite Difference Methods
Finite diﬀerence methods can be used for the same types of derivative pricing problems
as tree approaches. They can handle American-style as well as European-style deriva-
tives but cannot easily be used in situations where the payoﬀfrom a derivative depends
on the past history of the underlying variable. Finite diﬀerence methods can, at the
expense of a considerable increase in computer time, be used when there are several
state variables. The grid in Figure 21.15 then becomes multidimensional.
The method for calculating Greek letters is similar to that used for trees. Delta,
gamma, and theta can be calculated directly from the fi;j values on the grid. For vega,
it is necessary to make a small change to volatility and recalculate the value of the
derivative using the same grid.
SUMMARY
We have presented three diﬀerent numerical procedures for valuing derivatives when no
analytic solution is available. These involve the use of trees, Monte Carlo simulation,
and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods.
Binomial trees assume that, in each short interval of time t, a stock price either moves
up by a multiplicative amount u or down by a multiplicative amount d. The sizes of u

are done; E indicates node at which explicit calculations are done.

CHAPTER 21

and d and their associated probabilities are chosen so that the change in the stock price
has the correct mean and standard deviation in a risk-neutral world. Derivative prices are
calculated by starting at the end of the tree and working backwards. For an American
option, the value at a node is the greater of (a) the value if it is exercised immediately
and (b) the discounted expected value if it is held for a further period of time t.
Monte Carlo simulation involves using random numbers to sample many diﬀerent
paths that the variables underlying the derivative could follow in a risk-neutral world.
For each path, the payoﬀis calculated and discounted at the risk-free interest rate. The
arithmetic average of the discounted payoﬀs is the estimated value of the derivative.
Finite diﬀerence methods solve the underlying diﬀerential equation by converting it
to a diﬀerence equation. They are similar to tree approaches in that the computations
work back from the end of the life of the derivative to the beginning. The explicit ﬁnite
diﬀerence method is functionally the same as using a trinomial tree. The implicit ﬁnite
diﬀerence method is more complicated but has the advantage that the user does not
have to take any special precautions to ensure convergence.
In practice, the method that is chosen is likely to depend on the characteristics of the
derivative being evaluated and the accuracy required. Monte Carlo simulation works
forward from the beginning to the end of the life of a derivative. It can be used for
European-style derivatives and can cope with a great deal of complexity as far as the
payoﬀs are concerned. It becomes relatively more eﬃcient as the number of underlying
variables increases. Tree approaches and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods work from the end of
the life of a security to the beginning and can accommodate American-style as well as
European-style derivatives. However, they are diﬃcult to apply when the payoﬀs
depend on the past history of the state variables as well as on their current values.
Also, they are liable to become computationally very time consuming when three or
more variables are involved.

Value at Risk
Chapter 19 examined measures such as delta, gamma, and vega for describing diﬀerent
aspects of the risk in a portfolio of derivatives. A ﬁnancial institution usually calculates
each of these measures each day for every market variable to which it is exposed. Often
there are hundreds, or even thousands, of these market variables. A delta–gamma–vega
analysis, therefore, leads to a very large number of diﬀerent risk measures being
produced each day. These risk measures provide valuable information for the ﬁnancial
institution’s traders. However, they do not provide a way of measuring the total risk to
which the ﬁnancial institution is exposed.
Value at Risk (VaR) is an attempt to provide a single number summarizing the total
risk in a portfolio of ﬁnancial assets. It has become widely used by corporate treasurers
and fund managers as well as by ﬁnancial institutions. Bank regulators have tradition-
ally used VaR in determining the capital a bank is required to keep for the risks it is
bearing.
This chapter explains the VaR measure and describes the two main approaches for
calculating it. These are known as the historical simulation approach and the model-
building approach.
22.1
THE VaR MEASURE
When using the value-at-risk measure, an analyst is interested in making a statement of
the following form:
I am X percent certain there will not be a loss of more than V dollars in the next N days.
The variable V is the VaR of the portfolio. It is a function of two parameters: the time
horizon (N days) and the conﬁdence level (X%). It is the loss level over N days that has
a probability of only ð100  XÞ% of being exceeded. Bank regulators require banks to
calculate VaR for market risk with N ¼ 10 and X ¼ 99 (see the discussion in Business
Snapshot 22.1).
When N days is the time horizon and X% is the conﬁdence level, VaR is the loss
corresponding to the ð100  XÞth percentile of the distribution of the gain in the value of
the portfolio over the next N days. (Note that, when we look at the probability
distribution of the gain, a loss is a negative gain and VaR is concerned with the left
516
22
C H A P T E R

tail of the distribution. When we look at the probability distribution of the loss, a gain is
a negative loss and VaR is concerned with the right tail of the distribution.) For
example, when N ¼ 5 and X ¼ 97, VaR is the third percentile of the distribution of
gain in the value of the portfolio over the next 5 days. VaR is illustrated in Figures 22.1
and 22.2.
VaR is an attractive measure because it is easy to understand. In essence, it asks the
simple question ‘‘How bad can things get?’’ This is the question all senior managers
want answered. They are very comfortable with the idea of compressing all the Greek
letters for all the market variables underlying a portfolio into a single number.
If we accept that it is useful to have a single number to describe the risk of a portfolio,
an interesting question is whether VaR is the best alternative. Some researchers have
argued that VaR may tempt traders to choose a portfolio with a return distribution
similar to that in Figure 22.2. The portfolios in Figures 22.1 and 22.2 have the same
VaR, but the portfolio in Figure 22.2 is much riskier because potential losses are much
larger.
Business Snapshot 22.1
How Bank Regulators Use VaR
The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision is a committee of the world’s bank
regulators that meets regularly in Basel, Switzerland. In 1988 it published what has
become known as Basel I. This is an agreement between the regulators on how the
capital a bank is required to hold for credit risk should be calculated. Later the Basel
Committee published The 1996 Amendment which was implemented in 1998 and
required banks to hold capital for market risk as well as credit risk. The Amendment
distinguishes between a bank’s trading book and its banking book. The banking
book consists primarily of loans and is not usually revalued on a regular basis for
managerial and accounting purposes. The trading book consists of the myriad of
diﬀerent instruments that are traded by the bank (stocks, bonds, swaps, forward
contracts, options, etc.) and is normally revalued daily.
The 1996 Amendment calculates capital for the trading book using the VaR
measure with N ¼ 10 and X ¼ 99. This means that it focuses on the revaluation loss
over a 10-day period that is expected to be exceeded only 1% of the time. The capital
the bank is required to hold is k times this VaR measure (with an adjustment for what
are termed speciﬁc risks). The multiplier k is chosen on a bank-by-bank basis by the
regulators and must be at least 3.0. For a bank with excellent well-tested VaR
estimation procedures, it is likely that k will be set equal to the minimum value
of 3.0. For other banks it may be higher.
Basel I has been followed by Basel II, Basel II.5, and Basel III. Basel II (which was
implemented in most parts of the world in about 2007) uses VaR with a one-year
time horizon and a 99.9% conﬁdence level for calculating capital for credit risk and
operational risk. Basel II.5 (which was implemented in 2012) revised the way market
risk capital is calculated. One of the changes involves what is known as stressed VaR.
This is a VaR measure based on how market variables have moved during a
particularly adverse time period. Basel III is increasing the amount of capital that
banks are required to hold and the proportion of that capital that must be equity.
Interestingly, in May 2012, the Basel committee issued a discussion paper indicat-
ing that it is considering switching from VaR to expected shortfall for market risk.
Value at Risk
517

A measure that deals with the problem we have just mentioned is expected shortfall.1
Whereas VaR asks the question ‘‘How bad can things get?’’, expected shortfall asks ‘‘If
things do get bad, how much can the company expect to lose?’’ Expected shortfall is the
expected loss during an N-day period conditional on the loss being worse than the VaR
loss. For example, with X ¼ 99 and N ¼ 10, the expected shortfall is the average amount
the company loses over a 10-day period when the loss is worse than the 10-day 99% VaR.
The Time Horizon
VaR has two parameters: the time horizon N, measured in days, and the conﬁdence level
X. In practice, analysts almost invariably set N ¼ 1 in the ﬁrst instance when VaR is
estimated for market risk. This is because there is not usually enough data available to
estimate directly the behavior of market variables over periods of time longer than 1 day.
The usual assumption is

J.-M. Eber, and D. Heath, ‘‘Coherent Measures of Risk,’’ Mathematical Finance, 9 (1999): 203–28. These
authors deﬁne certain properties that a good risk measure should have and show that the standard VaR
measure does not have all of them. For more details, see J. Hull, Risk Management and Financial Institutions,
3rd edn. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2012.
518
CHAPTER 22

This formula is exactly true when the changes in the value of the portfolio on successive
days have independent identical normal distributions with mean zero. In other cases it
is an approximation.
22.2
HISTORICAL SIMULATION
Historical simulation is one popular way of estimating VaR. It involves using past data
as a guide to what will happen in the future. Suppose that we want to calculate VaR for
a portfolio using a one-day time horizon, a 99% conﬁdence level, and 501 days of data.
(The time horizon and conﬁdence level are those typically used for a market risk VaR
calculation; 501 is a popular choice for the number of days of data used because, as we
shall see, it leads to 500 scenarios being created.) The ﬁrst step is to identify the market
variables aﬀecting the portfolio. These will typically be interest rates, equity prices,
commodity prices, and so on. All prices are measured in the domestic currency. For
example, one market variable for a German bank is likely to be the S&P 500 measured
in euros.
Data are collected on movements in the market variables over the most recent
501 days. This provides 500 alternative scenarios for what can happen between today
and tomorrow. Denote the ﬁrst day for which we have data as Day 0, the second day as
Day 1, and so on. Scenario 1 is where the percentage changes in the values of all
variables are the same as they were between Day 0 and Day 1, Scenario 2 is where they
are the same as between Day 1 and Day 2, and so on. For each scenario, the dollar
change in the value of the portfolio between today and tomorrow is calculated. This
deﬁnes a probability distribution for daily loss (gains are negative losses) in the value of
our portfolio. The 99th percentile of the distribution can be estimated as the ﬁfth-
highest loss.2 The estimate of VaR is the loss when we are at this 99th percentile point.
We are 99% certain that we will not take a loss greater than the VaR estimate if the
changes in market variables in the last 501 days are representative of what will happen
between today and tomorrow.
To express the approach algebraically, deﬁne vi as the value of a market variable on
Day i and suppose that today is Day n. The ith scenario in the historical simulation
approach assumes that the value of the market variable tomorrow will be
Value under ith scenario ¼ vn

Illustration: Investment in Four Stock Indices
To illustrate the calculations underlying the approach, suppose that an investor in the
United States owns, on September 25, 2008, a portfolio worth $10 million consisting of
investments in four stock indices: the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the US,
the FTSE 100 in the UK, the CAC 40 in France, and the Nikkei 225 in Japan. The
value of the investment in each index on September 25, 2008, is shown in Table 22.1.

www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/OFOD/VaRExample
Because we are considering a US investor, the value of the FTSE 100, CAC 40, and
Nikkei 225 must be measured in US dollars. For example, the FTSE 100 was 5,823.40
on August 10, 2008, when the exchange rate was 1.8918 USD per GBP. This means
that, measured in US dollars, it was 5,823:40  1:8910 ¼ 11,016:71. An extract from the
data with all indices measured in US dollars is in Table 22.2.
September 25, 2008, is an interesting date to choose in evaluating an equity invest-
ment. The turmoil in credit markets, which started in August 2007, was over a year old.
Equity prices had been declining for several months. Volatilities were increasing.
Lehman Brothers had ﬁled for bankruptcy ten days earlier. The Treasury Secretary’s
$700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) had not yet been passed by the
United States Congress.
Table 22.3 shows the values of the indices (measured in US dollars) on September 26,
2008, for the scenarios considered. Scenario 1 (the ﬁrst row in Table 22.3) shows the
values of indices on September 26, 2008, assuming that their percentage changes
between September 25 and September 26, 2008, are the same as they were between
August 7 and August 8, 2006; Scenario 2 (the second row in Table 22.3) shows the
values of market variables on September 26, 2008, assuming these percentage changes

Similarly, the values of the FTSE 100, the CAC 40, and the Nikkei 225 are 9,569.23,
6,204.55, and 115.05, respectively. Therefore the value of the portfolio under Scenario 1
is (in $000s)
4,000  10,977:08
11,022:06 þ 3,000  9,569:23
9,599:90
þ 1,000  6,204:55
6,200:40 þ 2,000  115:05
112:82 ¼ 10,014:334
The portfolio therefore has a gain of $14,334 under Scenario 1. A similar calculation is
carried out for the other scenarios. A histogram for the losses is shown in Figure 22.3
(with gains being recorded as negative losses). The bars on the histogram represent
losses ($000s) in the ranges 450 to 550, 350 to 450, 250 to 350, and so on.
The losses for the 500 diﬀerent scenarios are then ranked. An extract from the results
of doing this is shown in Table 22.4. The worst scenario is number 494 (where indices
are assumed to change in the same way that they did at the time of the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers). The one-day 99% value at risk can be estimated as the ﬁfth-worst
loss. This is $253,385.
As explained in Section 22.1, the ten-day 99% VaR is usually calculated as
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
times
the one-day 99% VaR. In this case the ten-day VaR would therefore be
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
 253,385 ¼ 801,274
or $801,274.
Each day the VaR estimate in our example would be updated using the most recent
501 days of data. Consider, for example, what happens on September 26, 2008
(Day 501). We ﬁnd out new values for all the market variables and are able to calculate
a new value for our portfolio. We then go through the procedure we have outlined to

CHAPTER 22

calculate a new VaR. Data on the market variables from August 8, 2006, to September
26, 2008 (Day 1 to Day 501) are used in the calculation. (This gives us the required 500
observations on the percentage changes in market variables; the August 7, 2006, Day 0,
values of the market variables are no longer used.) Similarly, on the next trading day
September 29, 2008 (Day 502), data from August 9, 2006, to September 29, 2008 (Day 2
to Day 502) are used to determine VaR, and so on.
In practice, a ﬁnancial institution’s portfolio is, of course, considerably more
complicated than the one we have considered here. It is likely to consist of thousands
or tens of thousands of positions. Some of the bank’s positions are typically in forward
contracts, options, and other derivatives. Also, the portfolio itself is likely to change
from day to day. If a bank’s trading leads to a riskier porfolio, VaR typically increases;
if it leads to a less risky porfolio, VaR typically decreases. The VaR is calculated on any
given day on the assumption that the portfolio will remain unchanged over the next
business day.
It is often necessary to consider hundreds or even thousands of market variables in a
VaR calculation. In the case of interest rates, a bank typically needs several term
structures of zero-coupon interest rates in a number of diﬀerent currencies in order
to value its portfolio. The market variables that are considered are the ones from which
these term structures are calculated (see Chapter 4 for the calculation of the term
structure of zero rates). There might be as many as ten market variables for each zero
curve to which the bank is exposed.
22.3
MODEL-BUILDING APPROACH
The main alternative to historical simulation is the model-building approach. Before
getting into the details of the approach, it is appropriate to mention one issue
concerned with the units for measuring volatility.
Daily Volatilities
In option pricing, time is usually measured in years, and the volatility of an asset is
usually quoted as a ‘‘volatility per year’’. When using the model-building approach to
calculate VaR for market risk, time is usually measured in days and the volatility of an
asset is usually quoted as a ‘‘volatility per day.’’
What is the relationship between the volatility per year used in option pricing and the
volatility per day used in VaR calculations? Let us deﬁne year as the volatility per year
of a certain asset and day as the equivalent volatility per day of the asset. Assuming 252
trading days in a year, equation (15.2) gives the standard deviation of the continuously
compounded return on the asset in 1 year as either year or day
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
252
p
. It follows that
year ¼ day
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
252
p
or
day ¼ year
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
252
p
so that daily volatility is about 6% of annual volatility.
As pointed out in Section 15.4, day is approximately equal to the standard deviation
of the percentage change in the asset price in one day. For the purposes of calculating
Value at Risk
523

VaR we assume exact equality. The daily volatility of an asset price (or any other
variable) is therefore deﬁned as equal to the standard deviation of the percentage change
in one day.
Our discussion in the next few sections assumes that estimates of daily volatilities and
correlations are available. Chapter 23 discusses how the estimates can be produced.
Single-Asset Case
Consider how VaR is calculated using the model-building approach in a very simple
situation where the portfolio consists of a position in a single stock: $10 million in shares
of Microsoft. We suppose that N ¼ 10 and X ¼ 99, so that we are interested in the loss
level over 10 days that we are 99% conﬁdent will not be exceeded. Initially, we consider a
1-day time horizon.
Assume that the volatility of Microsoft is 2% per day (corresponding to about 32%
per year). Because the size of the position is $10 million, the standard deviation of daily
changes in the value of the position is 2% of $10 million, or $200,000.
It is customary in the model-building approach to assume that the expected change in
a market variable over the time period considered is zero. This is not strictly true, but it
is a reasonable assumption. The expected change in the price of a market variable over
a short time period is generally small when compared with the standard deviation of the
change. Suppose, for example, that Microsoft has an expected return of 20% per
annum. Over a 1-day period, the expected return is 0:20=252, or about 0.08%, whereas
the standard deviation of the return is 2%. Over a 10-day period, the expected return is
0:08  10, or about 0.8%, whereas the standard deviation of the return is 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
, or
about 6.3%.
So far, we have established that the change in the value of the portfolio of Microsoft
shares over a 1-day period has a standard deviation of $200,000 and (at least approxi-
mately) a mean of zero. We assume that the change is normally distributed.4 From the
Excel NORMSINV function, N1ð0:01Þ ¼ 2:326. This means that there is a 1% prob-
ability that a normally distributed variable will decrease in value by more than 2.326
standard deviations. Equivalently, it means that we are 99% certain that a normally
distributed variable will not decrease in value by more than 2.326 standard deviations.
The 1-day 99% VaR for our portfolio consisting of a $10 million position in Microsoft
is therefore
2:326  200,000 ¼ $465,300
As discussed earlier, the N-day VaR is calculated as
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
times the 1-day VaR. The
10-day 99% VaR for Microsoft is therefore
465,300 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
¼ $1,471,300
Consider next a portfolio consisting of a $5 million position in AT&T, and suppose
the daily volatility of AT&T is 1% (approximately 16% per year). A similar calculation
4 To be consistent with the option pricing assumption in Chapter 15, we could assume that the price of
Microsoft is lognormal tomorrow. Because 1 day is such a short period of time, this is almost
indistinguishable from the assumption we do make—that the change in the stock price between today and
tomorrow is normal.
524
CHAPTER 22

to that for Microsoft shows that the standard deviation of the change in the value of the
portfolio in 1 day is
5,000,000  0:01 ¼ 50,000
Assuming the change is normally distributed, the 1-day 99% VaR is
50,000  2:326 ¼ $116,300
and the 10-day 99% VaR is
116,300 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
¼ $367,800
Two-Asset Case
Now consider a portfolio consisting of both $10 million of Microsoft shares and
$5 million of AT&T shares. We suppose that the returns on the two shares have a
bivariate normal distribution with a correlation of 0.3. A standard result in statistics
tells us that, if two variables X and Y have standard deviations equal to X and Y with
the coeﬃcient of correlation between them equal to , the standard deviation of X þ Y
is given by
XþY ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
X þ 2
Y þ 2XY
q
To apply this result, we set X equal to the change in the value of the position in
Microsoft over a 1-day period and Y equal to the change in the value of the position in
AT&T over a 1-day period, so that
X ¼ 200,000
and
Y ¼ 50,000
The standard deviation of the change in the value of the portfolio consisting of both
stocks over a 1-day period is therefore
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
200,0002 þ 50; 0002 þ 2  0:3  200,000  50,000
p
¼ 220,200
The mean change is assumed to be zero and the change is normally distributed. So the
1-day 99% VaR is therefore
220,200  2:326 ¼ $512,300
The 10-day 99% VaR is
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
times this, or $1,620,100.
The Beneﬁts of Diversiﬁcation
In the example we have just considered:
1. The 10-day 99% VaR for the portfolio of Microsoft shares is $1,471,300.
2. The 10-day 99% VaR for the portfolio of AT&T shares is $367,800.
3. The 10-day 99% VaR for the portfolio of both Microsoft and AT&T shares is
$1,620,100.
The amount
ð1,471,300 þ 367,800Þ  1,620,100 ¼ $219,000
Value at Risk
525

represents the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation. If Microsoft and AT&T were perfectly
correlated, the VaR for the portfolio of both Microsoft and AT&T would equal the
VaR for the Microsoft portfolio plus the VaR for the AT&T portfolio. Less than
perfect correlation leads to some of the risk being ‘‘diversiﬁed away.’’5
22.4
THE LINEAR MODEL
The examples we have just considered are simple illustrations of the use of the linear
model for calculating VaR. Suppose that we have a portfolio worth P consisting of n
assets with an amount i being invested in asset i (1 6 i 6 n). Deﬁne xi as the return
on asset i in one day. The dollar change in the value of our investment in asset i in one
day is i xi and
P ¼
X
n
i¼1
i xi
ð22:1Þ
where P is the dollar change in the value of the whole portfolio in one day.
In the example considered in the previous section, $10 million was invested in the ﬁrst
asset (Microsoft) and $5 million was invested in the second asset (AT&T), so that (in
millions of dollars) 1 ¼ 10, 2 ¼ 5, and
P ¼ 10x1 þ 5x2
If we assume that the xi in equation (22.1) are multivariate normal, then P is
normally distributed. To calculate VaR, we therefore need to calculate only the
mean and standard deviation of P. We assume, as discussed in the previous
section, that the expected value of each xi is zero. This implies that the mean
of P is zero.
To calculate the standard deviation of P, we deﬁne i as the daily volatility of the
ith asset and ij as the coeﬃcient of correlation between returns on asset i and asset j.
This means that i is the standard deviation of xi, and ij is the coeﬃcient of
correlation between xi and xj. The variance of P, which we will denote by 2
P,
is given by
2

manager. He was awarded a Nobel prize for this research in 1990. See H. Markowitz, ‘‘Portfolio Selection,’’

In the example considered in the previous section, 1 ¼ 0:02, 2 ¼ 0:01, and
12 ¼ 0:3. As already noted, 1 ¼ 10 and 2 ¼ 5, so that

Correlation and Covariance Matrices
A correlation matrix is a matrix where the entry in the ith row and jth column is the
correlation ij between variable i and j. It is shown in Table 22.5. Since a variable is
always perfectly correlated with itself, the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix
are 1. Furthermore, because ij ¼ j i, the correlation matrix is symmetric. The correla-
tion matrix, together with the daily standard deviations of the variables, enables the
portfolio variance to be calculated using equation (22.2).
Instead of working with correlations and volatilities, analysts often use variances and
covariances. The daily variance vari of variable i is the square of its daily volatility:
vari ¼ 2
i
The covariance covij between variable i and variable j is the product of the daily
volatility of variable i, the daily volatility of variable j, and the correlation between i
and j:
covij ¼ i j ij
The equation for the variance of the portfolio in equation (22.2) can be written

In a covariance matrix, the entry in the ith row and jth column is the covariance
between variable i and variable j. As just mentioned, the covariance between a
variable and itself is its variance. The diagonal entries in the matrix are therefore
variances (see Table 22.6). For this reason, the covariance matrix is sometimes called
the variance–covariance matrix. (Like the correlation matrix, it is symmetric.) Using
matrix notation, the equation for the variance of the portfolio just given becomes
2
P ¼ aTCa
where a is the (column) vector whose ith element is i, C is the variance–covariance
matrix, and aT is the transpose of a.
The variances and covariances are generally calculated from historical data. We will
illustrate this in Section 23.8 for the four-index example introduced in Section 22.2.
Handling Interest Rates
It is out of the question in the model-building approach to deﬁne a separate market
variable for every single bond price or interest rate to which a company is exposed.
Some simpliﬁcations are necessary when the model-building approach is used. One
possibility is to assume that only parallel shifts in the yield curve occur. It is then
necessary to deﬁne only one market variable: the size of the parallel shift. The changes
in the value of a bond portfolio can then be calculated using the duration relationship
P ¼ DP y
where P is the value of the portfolio, P is the change in P in one day, D is the
modiﬁed duration of the portfolio, and y is the parallel shift in 1 day.
This approach does not usually give enough accuracy. The procedure usually
followed is to choose as market variables the prices of zero-coupon bonds with
standard maturities: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7 years,
10 years, and 30 years. For the purposes of calculating VaR, the cash ﬂows from
instruments in the portfolio are mapped into cash ﬂows occurring on the standard
maturity dates. Consider a $1 million position in a Treasury bond lasting 1.2 years that
pays a coupon of 6% semiannually. Coupons are paid in 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 years, and
the principal is paid in 1.2 years. This bond is, therefore, in the ﬁrst instance regarded
as a $30,000 position in 0.2-year zero-coupon bond plus a $30,000 position in a 0.7-
year zero-coupon bond plus a $1.03 million position in a 1.2-year zero-coupon bond.

CHAPTER 22

The position in the 0.2-year bond is then replaced by an approximately equivalent
position in 1-month and 3-month zero-coupon bonds; the position in the 0.7-year
bond is replaced by an approximately equivalent position in 6-month and 1-year zero-
coupon bonds; and the position in the 1.2-year bond is replaced by an approximately
equivalent position in 1-year and 2-year zero-coupon bonds. The result is that the
position in the 1.2-year coupon-bearing bond is for VaR purposes regarded as a
position in zero-coupon bonds having maturities of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months,
1 year, and 2 years.
This procedure is known as cash-ﬂow mapping. One way of doing it is explained in
Technical Note 25 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes. Note that
cash-ﬂow mapping is not necessary when the historical simulation approach is used.
This is because the complete term structure of interest rates can be calculated from the
variables that are considered for each of the scenarios generated.
Applications of the Linear Model
The simplest application of the linear model is to a portfolio with no derivatives
consisting of positions in stocks and bonds. Cash-ﬂow mapping converts the bonds
to zero-coupon bonds with standard maturities. The change in the value of the
portfolio is linearly dependent on the returns on the stocks and these zero-coupon
bonds.
An example of a derivative that can be handled by the linear model is a forward
contract to buy a foreign currency. Suppose the contract matures at time T. It can be
regarded as the exchange of a foreign zero-coupon bond maturing at time T for a
domestic zero-coupon bond maturing at time T. For the purposes of calculating VaR,
the forward contract is therefore treated as a long position in the foreign bond
combined with a short position in the domestic bond. Each bond can be handled using
a cash-ﬂow mapping procedure.
Consider next an interest rate swap. As explained in Chapter 7, this can be regarded
as the exchange of a ﬂoating-rate bond for a ﬁxed-rate bond. The ﬁxed-rate bond is a
regular coupon-bearing bond. The ﬂoating-rate bond is worth par just after the next
payment date. It can be regarded as a zero-coupon bond with a maturity date equal to
the next payment date. The interest rate swap therefore reduces to a portfolio of long
and short positions in bonds and can be handled using a cash-ﬂow mapping
procedure.
The Linear Model and Options
We now consider how we might try to use the linear model when there are options.
Consider ﬁrst a portfolio consisting of options on a single stock whose current price
is S. Suppose that the delta of the position (calculated in the way described in Chapter
19) is .6 Since  is the rate of change of the value of the portfolio with S, it is
approximately true that
 ¼ P
S
6 Normally we denote the delta and gamma of a portfolio by  and . In this section and the next, we use the
lower case Greek letters  and  to avoid overworking .
Value at Risk
529

or
P ¼  S
ð22:4Þ
where S is the dollar change in the stock price in 1 day and P is, as usual, the dollar
change in the portfolio in 1 day. Deﬁne x as the percentage change in the stock price
in 1 day, so that
x ¼ S
S
It follows that an approximate relationship between P and x is
P ¼ S x
When we have a position in several underlying market variables that includes options,
we can derive an approximate linear relationship between P and the xi similarly.
This relationship is
P ¼
X
n
i¼1
Sii xi
ð22:5Þ
where Si is the value of the ith market variable and i is the delta of the portfolio with
respect to the ith market variable. This corresponds to equation (22.1):
P ¼
X
n
i¼1
i xi
with i ¼ Sii. Equation (22.2) or (22.3) can therefore be used to calculate the standard
deviation of P.
Example 22.1
A portfolio consists of options on Microsoft and AT&T. The options on Microsoft
have a delta of 1,000, and the options on AT&T have a delta of 20,000. The
Microsoft share price is $120, and the AT&T share price is $30. From equa-
tion (22.5), it is approximately true that
P ¼ 120  1,000  x1 þ 30  20,000  x2
or
P ¼ 120,000x1 þ 600,000x2

equivalent to an investment of $120,000 in Microsoft and $600,000 in AT&T.)

22.5
THE QUADRATIC MODEL
When a portfolio includes options, the linear model is an approximation. It does not
take account of the gamma of the portfolio. As discussed in Chapter 19, delta is deﬁned
as the rate of change of the portfolio value with respect to an underlying market
variable and gamma is deﬁned as the rate of change of the delta with respect to the
market variable. Gamma measures the curvature of the relationship between the
portfolio value and an underlying market variable.
Figure 22.4 shows the impact of a nonzero gamma on the probability distribution of
the value of the portfolio. When gamma is positive, the probability distribution tends to
be positively skewed; when gamma is negative, it tends to be negatively skewed.
Figures 22.5 and 22.6 illustrate the reason for this result. Figure 22.5 shows the relation-
ship between the value of a long call option and the price of the underlying asset. A long
call is an example of an option position with positive gamma. The ﬁgure shows that,
when the probability distribution for the price of the underlying asset at the end of 1 day
is normal, the probability distribution for the option price is positively skewed.7
Figure 22.6 shows the relationship between the value of a short call position and the
price of the underlying asset. A short call position has a negative gamma. In this case, we
see that a normal distribution for the price of the underlying asset at the end of 1 day gets
mapped into a negatively skewed distribution for the value of the option position.
The VaR for a portfolio is critically dependent on the left tail of the probability
distribution of the portfolio value. For example, when the conﬁdence level used is 99%,
the VaR is the value in the left tail below which there is only 1% of the distribution. As
indicated in Figures 22.4a and 22.5, a positive gamma portfolio tends to have a less
heavy left tail than the normal distribution. If the distribution of P is normal, the
calculated VaR tends to be too high. Similarly, as indicated in Figures 22.4b and 22.6, a
negative gamma portfolio tends to have a heavier left tail than the normal distribution.
If the distribution of P is normal, the calculated VaR tends to be too low.
For a more accurate estimate of VaR than that given by the linear model, both delta
and gamma measures can be used to relate P to the xi. Consider a portfolio
dependent on a single asset whose price is S. Suppose  and  are the delta and gamma

Equation (22.7) is not as easy to work with as equation (22.1), but it can be used to
calculate moments for P. A result in statistics known as the Cornish–Fisher expansion
can be used to estimate percentiles of the probability distribution from the moments.9
22.6
MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
As an alternative to the procedure described so far, the model-building approach can be
implemented using Monte Carlo simulation to generate the probability distribution

when terms of higher order than t are ignored. In practice, the  t term is so small that it is usually

for P. Suppose we wish to calculate a 1-day VaR for a portfolio. The procedure is
as follows:
1. Value the portfolio today in the usual way using the current values of market
variables.
2. Sample once from the multivariate normal probability distribution of the xi.10
3. Use the values of the xi that are sampled to determine the value of each market
variable at the end of one day.
4. Revalue the portfolio at the end of the day in the usual way.
5. Subtract the value calculated in Step 1 from the value in Step 4 to determine a
sample P.
6. Repeat Steps 2 to 5 many times to build up a probability distribution for P.
The VaR is calculated as the appropriate percentile of the probability distribution of
P. Suppose, for example, that we calculate 5,000 diﬀerent sample values of P in the
way just described. The 1-day 99% VaR is the value of P for the 50th worst outcome;
the 1-day VaR 95% is the value of P for the 250th worst outcome; and so on.11 The
N-day VaR is usually assumed to be the 1-day VaR multiplied by
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N

.12
The drawback of Monte Carlo simulation is that it tends to be slow because a
company’s complete portfolio (which might consist of hundreds of thousands of
diﬀerent instruments) has to be revalued many times.13 One way of speeding things up
is to assume that equation (22.7) describes the relationship between P and the xi. We
can then jump straight from Step 2 to Step 5 in the Monte Carlo simulation and avoid the
need for a complete revaluation of the portfolio. This is sometimes referred to as the
partial simulation approach. A similar approach is sometimes used when implementing
historical simulation.
22.7
COMPARISON OF APPROACHES
We have discussed two methods for estimating VaR: the historical simulation approach
and the model-building approach. The advantages of the model-building approach are
that results can be produced very quickly and it can easily be used in conjunction with
volatility updating schemes such as those we will describe in the next chapter. The main
disadvantage of the model-building approach is that it assumes that the market variables
have a multivariate normal distribution. In practice, daily changes in market variables
often have distributions with tails that are quite diﬀerent from the normal distribution.
This is illustrated in Table 20.1.
The historical simulation approach has the advantage that historical data determine
the joint probability distribution of the market variables. It also avoids the need for
10 One way of doing so is given in Section 21.6.
11 As in the case of historical simulation, extreme value theory can be used to ‘‘smooth the tails’’ so that
better estimates of extreme percentiles are obtained.
12 This is only approximately true when the portfolio includes options, but it is the assumption that is made
in practice for most VaR calculation methods.
13 An approach for limiting the number of portfolio revaluations is proposed in F. Jamshidian and Y. Zhu
‘‘Scenario simulation model: theory and methodology,’’ Finance and Stochastics, 1 (1997), 43–67.

cash-ﬂow mapping. The main disadvantages of historical simulation are that it is
computationally slow and does not easily allow volatility updating schemes to be used.14
One disadvantage of the model-building approach is that it tends to give poor results
for low-delta portfolios (see Problem 22.21).
22.8
STRESS TESTING AND BACK TESTING
In addition to calculating VaR, many companies carry out what is known as stress
testing. This involves estimating how a company’s portfolio would have performed
under some of the most extreme market moves seen in the last 10 to 20 years.
For example, to test the impact of an extreme movement in US equity prices, a
company might set the percentage changes in all market variables equal to those on
October 19, 1987 (when the S&P 500 moved by 22.3 standard deviations). If this is
considered to be too extreme, the company might choose January 8, 1988 (when the S&P
500 moved by 6.8 standard deviations). To test the eﬀect of extreme movements in UK
interest rates, the company might set the percentage changes in all market variables equal
to those on April 10, 1992 (when 10-year bond yields moved by 7.7 standard deviations).
The scenarios used in stress testing are also sometimes generated by senior manage-
ment. One technique sometimes used is to ask senior management to meet periodically
and ‘‘brainstorm’’ to develop extreme scenarios that might occur given the current
economic environment and global uncertainties.
Stress testing can be considered as a way of taking into account extreme events that
do occur from time to time but are virtually impossible according to the probability
distributions assumed for market variables. A 5-standard-deviation daily move in a
market variable is one such extreme event. Under the assumption of a normal
distribution, it happens about once every 7,000 years, but, in practice, it is not
uncommon to see a 5-standard-deviation daily move once or twice every 10 years.
Following the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, regulators have proposed the calculation
of stressed VaR. This is VaR based on a historical simulation of how market variables
moved during a period of stressed market conditions (such as those in 2008).
Whatever the method used for calculating VaR, an important reality check is back
testing. It involves testing how well the VaR estimates would have performed in the past.
Suppose that we are calculating a 1-day 99% VaR. Back testing would involve looking
at how often the loss in a day exceeded the 1-day 99% VaR that would have been
calculated for that day. If this happened on about 1% of the days, we can feel
reasonably comfortable with the methodology for calculating VaR. If it happened
on, say, 7% of days, the methodology is suspect.
22.9
PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS
One approach to handling the risk arising from groups of highly correlated market
variables is principal components analysis. This is a standard statistical tool with many

applications in risk management. It takes historical data on movements in the market
variables and attempts to deﬁne a set of components or factors that explain the
movements.
The approach is best illustrated with an example. The market variables we will
consider are swap rates with maturities 1 year, 2 years 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 7 years,
10 years, and 30 years. Tables 22.7 and 22.8 show results produced for these market
variables using 2,780 daily observations between 2000 and 2011. The ﬁrst column in
Table 22.7 shows the maturities of the rates that were considered. The remaining eight
columns in the table show the eight factors (or principal components) describing the
rate moves. The ﬁrst factor, shown in the column labeled PC1, corresponds to a roughly
parallel shift in the yield curve. When we have one unit of that factor, the 1-year rate
increases by 0.216 basis points, the 2-year rate increases by 0.331 basis points, and so
on. The second factor is shown in the column labeled PC2. It corresponds to a ‘‘twist’’
or change of slope of the yield curve. Rates between 1 year and 4 years move in one
direction; rates between 5 years and 30 years move in the other direction. The third
factor corresponds to a ‘‘bowing’’ of the yield curve. Relatively short rates (1 year and
2 year) and relatively long rates (10 year and 30 year) move in one direction; the
intermediate rates move in the other direction. The interest rate move for a particular
factor is known as factor loading. In our example, the ﬁrst factor’s loading for the
1-year rate is 0.216.15
Because there are eight rates and eight factors, the interest rate changes observed on
any given day can always be expressed as a linear sum of the factors by solving a set of
eight simultaneous equations. The quantity of a particular factor in the interest rate
changes on a particular day is known as the factor score for that day.
The importance of a factor is measured by the standard deviation of its factor score.
The standard deviations of the factor scores in our example are shown in Table 22.8 and
the factors are listed in order of their importance. The numbers in Table 22.8 are
measured in basis points. A quantity of the ﬁrst factor equal to 1 standard deviation,
therefore, corresponds to the 1-year rate moving by 0:216  17:55 ¼ 3:78 basis points,
the 2-year rate moving by 0:331  17:55 ¼ 5:81 basis points, and so on.

author’s website. The factors have the property that the factor scores are uncorrelated
across the data. For instance, in our example, the ﬁrst factor score (amount of parallel
shift) is uncorrelated with the second factor score (amount of twist) across the 2,780
days. The variances of the factor scores have the property that they add up to the total
variance of the data. From Table 22.8, the total variance of the original data (that is,
sum of the variance of the observations on the 1-year rate, the variance of the
observations on the 2-year rate, and so on) is
17:552 þ 4:772 þ 2:082 þ    þ 0:532 ¼ 338:8
From this it can be seen that the ﬁrst factor accounts for 17:552=338:8 ¼ 90:9% of the
variance in the original data; the ﬁrst two factors account for
ð17:552 þ 4:772Þ=338:8 ¼ 97:7%
of the variance in the data; the third factor accounts for a further 1.3% of the variance.
This shows that most of the risk in interest rate moves is accounted for by the ﬁrst two
or three factors. It suggests that we can relate the risks in a portfolio of interest rate

Using Principal Components Analysis to Calculate VaR
To illustrate how a principal components analysis can be used to calculate VaR, consider
a portfolio with the exposures to interest rate moves shown in Table 22.9. A 1-basis-point
change in the 3-year rate causes the portfolio value to increase by $10 million, a 1-basis-
point change in the 4-year rate causes it to increase by $4 million, and so on. Suppose the
ﬁrst two factors are used to model rate moves. (As mentioned above, this captures 97.7%
of the variance in rate moves.) Using the data in Table 22.7, the exposure to the ﬁrst
factor (measured in millions of dollars per factor score basis point) is
10  0:372 þ 4  0:392  8  0:404  7  0:394 þ 2  0:376 ¼ 0:05

Suppose that f1 and f2 are the factor scores (measured in basis points). The change in
the portfolio value is, to a good approximation, given by
P ¼ 0:05f1  3:87f2
The factor scores are uncorrelated and have the standard deviations given in Table 22.8.
The standard deviation of P is therefore

Hence, the 1-day 99% VaR is 18:48  2:326 ¼ 42:99. Note that the data in Table 22.9
are such that there is very little exposure to the ﬁrst factor and signiﬁcant exposure to
the second factor. Using only one factor would signiﬁcantly understate VaR (see
Problem 22.11). The duration-based method for handling interest rates, mentioned in
Section 22.4, would also signiﬁcantly understate VaR as it considers only parallel shifts
in the yield curve.
A principal components analysis can in theory be used for market variables other
than interest rates. Suppose that a ﬁnancial institution has exposures to a number of

diﬀerent stock indices. A principal components analysis can be used to identify factors
describing movements in the indices and the most important of these can be used to
replace the market indices in a VaR analysis. How eﬀective a principal components
analysis is for a group of market variables depends on how closely correlated they are.
As explained earlier in the chapter, VaR is usually calculated by relating the actual
changes in a portfolio to percentage changes in market variables (the xi). For a VaR
calculation, it may therefore be most appropriate to carry out a principal components
analysis on percentage changes in market variables rather than actual changes.
SUMMARY
A value at risk (VaR) calculation is aimed at making a statement of the form: ‘‘We
are X percent certain that we will not lose more than V dollars in the next N days.’’
The variable V is the VaR, X% is the conﬁdence level, and N days is the time
horizon.
One approach to calculating VaR is historical simulation. This involves creating a
database consisting of the daily movements in all market variables over a period of
time. The ﬁrst simulation trial assumes that the percentage changes in each market
variable are the same as those on the ﬁrst day covered by the database; the second
simulation trial assumes that the percentage changes are the same as those on the
second day; and so on. The change in the portfolio value, P, is calculated for each
simulation trial, and the VaR is calculated as the appropriate percentile of the
probability distribution of P.
An alternative is the model-building approach. This is relatively straightforward if
two assumptions can be made:
1. The change in the value of the portfolio (P) is linearly dependent on percentage
changes in market variables.
2. The percentage changes in market variables are multivariate normally distributed.
The probability distribution of P is then normal, and there are analytic formulas for
relating the standard deviation of P to the volatilities and correlations of the under-
lying market variables. The VaR can be calculated from well-known properties of the
normal distribution.
When a portfolio includes options, P is not linearly related to the percentage
changes in market variables. From knowledge of the gamma of the portfolio, we can
derive an approximate quadratic relationship between P and percentage changes in
market variables. Monte Carlo simulation can then be used to estimate VaR.
In the next chapter we discuss how volatilities and correlations can be estimated and
monitored.

Practice Questions (Answers in Solutions Manual)
22.1. Consider a position consisting of a $100,000 investment in asset A and a $100,000
investment in asset B. Assume that the daily volatilities of both assets are 1% and that
the coeﬃcient of correlation between their returns is 0.3. What is the 5-day 99% VaR for
the portfolio?
22.2. Describe three ways of handling instruments that are dependent on interest rates when
the model-building approach is used to calculate VaR. How would you handle these
instruments when historical simulation is used to calculate VaR?
22.3. A ﬁnancial institution owns a portfolio of options on the US dollar–sterling exchange
rate. The delta of the portfolio is 56.0. The current exchange rate is 1.5000. Derive an
approximate linear relationship between the change in the portfolio value and the
percentage change in the exchange rate. If the daily volatility of the exchange rate is
0.7%, estimate the 10-day 99% VaR.
22.4. Suppose you know that the gamma of the portfolio in the previous question is 16.2. How
does this change your estimate of the relationship between the change in the portfolio
value and the percentage change in the exchange rate?
22.5. Suppose that the daily change in the value of a portfolio is, to a good approximation,
linearly dependent on two factors, calculated from a principal components analysis. The
delta of a portfolio with respect to the ﬁrst factor is 6 and the delta with respect to the
second factor is 4. The standard deviations of the factors are 20 and 8, respectively.

Assume that there are no derivatives. Explain the assumptions underlying (a) the linear
model and (b) the historical simulation model for calculating VaR.
22.7. Explain how an interest rate swap is mapped into a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds with
standard maturities for the purposes of a VaR calculation.
22.8. Explain the diﬀerence between value at risk and expected shortfall.
22.9. Explain why the linear model can provide only approximate estimates of VaR for a
portfolio containing options.
22.10. Some time ago a company entered into a forward contract to buy £1 million for
$1.5 million. The contract now has 6 months to maturity. The daily volatility of a
6-month zero-coupon sterling bond (when its price is translated to dollars) is 0.06% and
the daily volatility of a 6-month zero-coupon dollar bond is 0.05%. The correlation
between returns from the two bonds is 0.8. The current exchange rate is 1.53. Calculate
the standard deviation of the change in the dollar value of the forward contract in 1 day.
What is the 10-day 99% VaR? Assume that the 6-month interest rate in both sterling and
dollars is 5% per annum with continuous compounding.
22.11. The text calculates a VaR estimate for the example in Table 22.9 assuming two factors.
How does the estimate change if you assume (a) one factor and (b) three factors.
22.12. A bank has a portfolio of options on an asset. The delta of the options is –30 and the
gamma is 5. Explain how these numbers can be interpreted. The asset price is 20 and
its volatility is 1% per day. Adapt Sample Application E in the DerivaGem Application
Builder software to calculate VaR.
22.13. Suppose that in Problem 22.12 the vega of the portfolio is 2 per 1% change in the
annual volatility. Derive a model relating the change in the portfolio value in 1 day to
delta, gamma, and vega. Explain without doing detailed calculations how you would use
the model to calculate a VaR estimate.
22.14. The one-day 99% VaR is calculated for the four-index example in Section 22.2 as
$253,385. Look at the underlying spreadsheets on the author’s website and calculate:
(a) the one-day 95% VaR and (b) the one-day 97% VaR.
22.15. Use the spreadsheets on the author’s website to calculate the one-day 99% VaR, using the
basic methodology in Section 22.2, if the four-index portfolio considered in Section 22.2 is
equally divided between the four indices.
Further Questions
22.16. A company has a position in bonds worth $6 million. The modiﬁed duration of the
portfolio is 5.2 years. Assume that only parallel shifts in the yield curve can take place
and that the standard deviation of the daily yield change (when yield is measured in
percent) is 0.09. Use the duration model to estimate the 20-day 90% VaR for the
portfolio. Explain carefully the weaknesses of this approach to calculating VaR. Explain
two alternatives that give more accuracy.
22.17. Consider a position consisting of a $300,000 investment in gold and a $500,000
investment in silver. Suppose that the daily volatilities of these two assets are 1.8%
and 1.2%, respectively, and that the coeﬃcient of correlation between their returns is 0.6.

What is the 10-day 97.5% VaR for the portfolio? By how much does diversiﬁcation
reduce the VaR?
22.18. Consider a portfolio of options on a single asset. Suppose that the delta of the portfolio
is 12, the value of the asset is $10, and the daily volatility of the asset is 2%. Estimate the
1-day 95% VaR for the portfolio from the delta. Suppose next that the gamma of the
portfolio is 2:6. Derive a quadratic relationship between the change in the portfolio
value and the percentage change in the underlying asset price in one day. How would
you use this in a Monte Carlo simulation?
22.19. A company has a long position in a 2-year bond and a 3-year bond, as well as a short
position in a 5-year bond. Each bond has a principal of $100 and pays a 5% coupon
annually. Calculate the company’s exposure to the 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and
5-year rates. Use the data in Tables 22.7 and 22.8 to calculate a 20-day 95% VaR on the
assumption that rate changes are explained by (a) one factor, (b) two factors,
and (c) three factors. Assume that the zero-coupon yield curve is ﬂat at 5%.
22.20. A bank has written a call option on one stock and a put option on another stock. For
the ﬁrst option the stock price is 50, the strike price is 51, the volatility is 28% per
annum, and the time to maturity is 9 months. For the second option the stock price is
20, the strike price is 19, the volatility is 25% per annum, and the time to maturity is
1 year. Neither stock pays a dividend, the risk-free rate is 6% per annum, and the
correlation between stock price returns is 0.4. Calculate a 10-day 99% VaR:
(a) Using only deltas
(b) Using the partial simulation approach
(c) Using the full simulation approach.
22.21. A common complaint of risk managers is that the model-building approach (either linear
or quadratic) does not work well when delta is close to zero. Test what happens when delta
is close to zero by using Sample Application E in the DerivaGem Applications. (You can
do this by experimenting with diﬀerent option positions and adjusting the position in the
underlying to give a delta of zero.) Explain the results you get.
22.22. Suppose that the portfolio considered in Section 22.2 has (in $000s) 3,000 in DJIA, 3,000
in FTSE, 1,000 in CAC 40 and 3,000 in Nikkei 225. Use the spreadsheet on the author’s
website to calculate what diﬀerence this makes to the one-day 99% VaR that is
calculated in Section 22.2.

CHAPTER 22

Estimating
Volatilities and
Correlations
In this chapter we explain how historical data can be used to produce estimates of the
current and future levels of volatilities and correlations. The chapter is relevant both to
the calculation of value at risk using the model-building approach and to the valuation
of derivatives. When calculating value at risk, we are most interested in the current
levels of volatilities and correlations because we are assessing possible changes in the
value of a portfolio over a very short period of time. When valuing derivatives, forecasts
of volatilities and correlations over the whole life of the derivative are usually required.
The chapter considers models with imposing names such as exponentially weighted
moving average (EWMA), autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), and
generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH). The distinctive
feature of the models is that they recognize that volatilities and correlations are not
constant. During some periods, a particular volatility or correlation may be relatively
low, whereas during other periods it may be relatively high. The models attempt to keep
track of the variations in the volatility or correlation through time.
23.1
ESTIMATING VOLATILITY
Deﬁne n as the volatility of a market variable on day n, as estimated at the end of
day n  1. The square of the volatility, 2
n, on day n is the variance rate. We described
the standard approach to estimating n from historical data in Section 15.4. Suppose
that the value of the market variable at the end of day i is Si. The variable ui is deﬁned
as the continuously compounded return during day i (between the end of day i  1 and
the end of day i):
ui ¼ ln Si
Si1
An unbiased estimate of the variance rate per day, 2
n, using the most recent m
observations on the ui is
2
n ¼
1
m  1
X
m
i¼1
ðuni  uÞ2
ð23:1Þ
543
23
C H A P T E R

where u is the mean of the uis:
u ¼ 1
m
X
m
i¼1
uni
For the purposes of monitoring daily volatility, the formula in equation (23.1) is
usually changed in a number of ways:
1. ui is deﬁned as the percentage change in the market variable between the end of
day i  1 and the end of day i, so that:1
ui ¼ Si  Si1
Si1
ð23:2Þ
2. u is assumed to be zero.2
3. m  1 is replaced by m.3
These three changes make very little diﬀerence to the estimates that are calculated, but
they allow us to simplify the formula for the variance rate to
2
n ¼ 1
m
X
m
i¼1
u2
ni
ð23:3Þ
where ui is given by equation (23.2).4
Weighting Schemes
Equation (23.3) gives equal weight to u2
n1; u2
n2; . . . ; u2
nm. Our objective is to estimate
the current level of volatility, n. It therefore makes sense to give more weight to recent
data. A model that does this is
2
n ¼
X
m
i¼1
i u2
ni
ð23:4Þ
The variable i is the amount of weight given to the observation i days ago. The ’s are
positive. If we choose them so that i < j when i > j, less weight is given to older
observations. The weights must sum to unity, so that
X
m
i¼1
i ¼ 1
1 This is consistent with the point made in Section 22.3 about the way that volatility is deﬁned for the
purposes of VaR calculations.
2 As explained in Section 22.3, this assumption usually has very little eﬀect on estimates of the variance
because the expected change in a variable in one day is very small when compared with the standard deviation
of changes.
3 Replacing m  1 by m moves us from an unbiased estimate of the variance to a maximum likelihood
estimate. Maximum likelihood estimates are discussed later in the chapter.
4 Note that the u’s in this chapter play the same role as the x’s in Chapter 22. Both are daily percentage
changes in market variables. In the case of the u’s, the subscripts count observations made on diﬀerent days
on the same market variable. In the case of the x’s, they count observations made on the same day on
diﬀerent market variables. The use of subscripts for  is similarly diﬀerent between the two chapters. In this
chapter, the subscripts refer to days; in Chapter 22 they referred to market variables.
544
CHAPTER 23

An extension of the idea in equation (23.4) is to assume that there is a long-run average
variance rate and that this should be given some weight. This leads to the model that
takes the form
2
n ¼ VL þ
X
m
i¼1
i u2
ni
ð23:5Þ
where VL is the long-run variance rate and  is the weight assigned to VL. Since the
weights must sum to unity, we have
 þ
X
m
i¼1
i ¼ 1
This is known as an ARCH(m) model. It was ﬁrst suggested by Engle.5 The estimate of
the variance is based on a long-run average variance and m observations. The older an
observation, the less weight it is given. Deﬁning ! ¼ VL, the model in equation (23.5)
can be written
2
n ¼ ! þ
X
m
i¼1
i u2
ni
ð23:6Þ
In the next two sections we discuss two important approaches to monitoring volatility
using the ideas in equations (23.4) and (23.5).
23.2
THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE MODEL
The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model is a particular case of the
model in equation (23.4) where the weights i decrease exponentially as we move back
through time. Speciﬁcally, iþ1 ¼ i, where  is a constant between 0 and 1.
It turns out that this weighting scheme leads to a particularly simple formula for
updating volatility estimates. The formula is
2
n ¼ 2
n1 þ ð1  Þu2
n1
ð23:7Þ
The estimate, n, of the volatility of a variable for day n (made at the end of day n  1) is
calculated from n1 (the estimate that was made at the end of day n  2 of the volatility
for day n  1) and un1 (the most recent daily percentage change in the variable).
To understand why equation (23.7) corresponds to weights that decrease exponen-
tially, we substitute for 2
n1 to get
2
n ¼ ½2
n2 þ ð1  Þu2
n2 þ ð1  Þu2
n1
or
2
n ¼ ð1  Þðu2
n1 þ u2
n2Þ þ 22
n2
Substituting in a similar way for 2
n2 gives
2
n ¼ ð1  Þðu2
n1 þ u2
n2 þ 2u2
n3Þ þ 32
n3
5 See R. Engle ‘‘Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity with Estimates of the Variance of UK
Inﬂation,’’ Econometrica, 50 (1982): 987–1008.
Estimating Volatilities and Correlations
545

Continuing in this way gives
2
n ¼ ð1  Þ
X
m
i¼1
i1u2
ni þ m2
nm
For large m, the term m2
nm is suﬃciently small to be ignored, so that equation (23.7)
is the same as equation (23.4) with i ¼ ð1  Þi1. The weights for the ui decline at
rate  as we move back through time. Each weight is  times the previous weight.
Example 23.1
Suppose that  is 0.90, the volatility estimated for a market variable for day n  1
is 1% per day, and during day n  1 the market variable increased by 2%. This
means that 2
n1 ¼ 0:012 ¼ 0:0001 and u2
n1 ¼ 0:022 ¼ 0:0004. Equation (23.7)
gives
2
n ¼ 0:9  0:0001 þ 0:1  0:0004 ¼ 0:00013
The estimate of the volatility, n, for day n is therefore
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:00013
p
, or 1.14%, per
day. Note that the expected value of u2
n1 is 2
n1, or 0.0001. In this example, the
realized value of u2
n1 is greater than the expected value, and as a result our
volatility estimate increases. If the realized value of u2
n1 had been less than its
expected value, our estimate of the volatility would have decreased.
The EWMA approach has the attractive feature that relatively little data need be
stored. At any given time, only the current estimate of the variance rate and the most
recent observation on the value of the market variable need be remembered. When a
new observation on the market variable is obtained, a new daily percentage change is
calculated and equation (23.7) is used to update the estimate of the variance rate. The
old estimate of the variance rate and the old value of the market variable can then be
discarded.
The EWMA approach is designed to track changes in the volatility. Suppose there
is a big move in the market variable on day n  1, so that u2
n1 is large. From
equation (23.7) this causes the estimate of the current volatility to move upward.
The value of  governs how responsive the estimate of the daily volatility is to the
most recent daily percentage change. A low value of  leads to a great deal of weight
being given to the u2
n1 when n is calculated. In this case, the estimates produced for
the volatility on successive days are themselves highly volatile. A high value of  (i.e.,
a value close to 1.0) produces estimates of the daily volatility that respond relatively
slowly to new information provided by the daily percentage change.
The RiskMetrics database, which was originally created by JPMorgan and made
publicly available in 1994, used the EWMA model with  ¼ 0:94 for updating daily
volatility estimates. This is because the company found that, across a range of diﬀerent
market variables, this value of  gives forecasts of the variance rate that come closest to
the realized variance rate.6 The realized variance rate on a particular day was calculated
as an equally weighted average of the u2
i on the subsequent 25 days (see Problem 23.19).
6 See JPMorgan, RiskMetrics Monitor, Fourth Quarter, 1995. We will explain an alternative (maximum
likelihood) approach to estimating parameters later in the chapter.
546
CHAPTER 23

23.3
THE GARCH(1,1) MODEL
We now move on to discuss what is known as the GARCH(1,1) model, proposed by
Bollerslev in 1986.7 The diﬀerence between the GARCH(1,1) model and the EWMA
model is analogous to the diﬀerence between equation (23.4) and equation (23.5). In
GARCH(1,1), 2
n is calculated from a long-run average variance rate, VL, as well as
from n1 and un1. The equation for GARCH(1,1) is
2
n ¼ VL þ u2
n1 þ 2
n1
ð23:8Þ
where  is the weight assigned to VL,  is the weight assigned to u2
n1, and  is the weight
assigned to 2
n1. Since the weights must sum to unity, it follows that
 þ  þ  ¼ 1
The EWMA model is a particular case of GARCH(1,1) where  ¼ 0,  ¼ 1  ,
and  ¼ .
The ‘‘(1,1)’’ in GARCH(1,1) indicates that 2
n is based on the most recent observa-
tion of u2 and the most recent estimate of the variance rate. The more general
GARCH(p, q) model calculates 2
n from the most recent p observations on u2 and
the most recent q estimates of the variance rate.8 GARCH(1,1) is by far the most
popular of the GARCH models.
Setting ! ¼ VL, the GARCH(1,1) model can also be written
2
n ¼ ! þ u2
n1 þ 2
n1
ð23:9Þ
This is the form of the model that is usually used for the purposes of estimating the
parameters. Once !, , and  have been estimated, we can calculate  as 1    . The
long-term variance VL can then be calculated as !=. For a stable GARCH(1,1) process
we require  þ  < 1. Otherwise the weight applied to the long-term variance is
negative.
Example 23.2
Suppose that a GARCH(1,1) model is estimated from daily data as
2
n ¼ 0:000002 þ 0:13u2
n1 þ 0:862
n1
This
corresponds
to
 ¼ 0:13,
 ¼ 0:86,
and
! ¼ 0:000002.
Because
 ¼ 1    , it follows that  ¼ 0:01. Because ! ¼ VL, it follows that
VL ¼ 0:0002. In other words, the long-run average variance per day implied by
the model is 0.0002. This corresponds to a volatility of
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:0002
p
¼ 0:014, or 1.4%,
per day.
7 See T. Bollerslev, ‘‘Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity,’’ Journal of Econometrics,
31 (1986): 307–27.
8 Other GARCH models have been proposed that incorporate asymmetric news. These models are designed
so that n depends on the sign of un1. Arguably, the models are more appropriate for equities than
GARCH(1,1). As mentioned in Chapter 20, the volatility of an equity’s price tends to be inversely related to
the price so that a negative un1 should have a bigger eﬀect on n than the same positive un1. For a
discussion of models for handling asymmetric news, see D. Nelson, ‘‘Conditional Heteroscedasticity and
Asset Returns: A New Approach,’’ Econometrica, 59 (1990): 347–70; R. F. Engle and V. Ng, ‘‘Measuring and
Testing the Impact of News on Volatility,’’ Journal of Finance, 48 (1993): 1749–78.
Estimating Volatilities and Correlations
547

Suppose that the estimate of the volatility on day n  1 is 1.6% per day, so that
2
n1 ¼ 0:0162 ¼ 0:000256, and that on day n  1 the market variable decreased
by 1%, so that u2
n1 ¼ 0:012 ¼ 0:0001. Then
2
n ¼ 0:000002 þ 0:13  0:0001 þ 0:86  0:000256 ¼ 0:00023516
The new estimate of the volatility is therefore
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:00023516
p
¼ 0:0153, or 1.53%,
per day.
The Weights
Substituting for 2
n1 in equation (23.9) gives
2
n ¼ ! þ u2
n1 þ ð! þ u2
n2 þ 2
n2Þ
or
2
n ¼ ! þ ! þ u2
n1 þ u2
n2 þ 22
n2
Substituting for 2
n2 gives
2
n ¼ ! þ ! þ 2! þ u2
n1 þ u2
n2 þ 2u2
n3 þ 32
n3
Continuing in this way, we see that the weight applied to u2
ni is i1. The weights
decline exponentially at rate . The parameter  can be interpreted as a ‘‘decay rate’’. It
is similar to  in the EWMA model. It deﬁnes the relative importance of the observa-
tions on the u’s in determining the current variance rate. For example, if  ¼ 0:9, then
u2
n2 is only 90% as important as u2
n1; u2
n3 is 81% as important as u2
n1; and so on.
The GARCH(1,1) model is similar to the EWMA model except that, in addition to
assigning weights that decline exponentially to past u2, it also assigns some weight to
the long-run average volatility.
Mean Reversion
The GARCH (1,1) model recognizes that over time the variance tends to get pulled
back to a long-run average level of VL. The amount of weight assigned to VL is  ¼
1    . The GARCH(1,1) is equivalent to a model where the variance V follows the
stochastic process
dV ¼ aðVL  VÞ dt þ V dz
where time is measured in days, a ¼ 1    , and  ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
(see Problem 23.14). This
is a mean-reverting model. The variance has a drift that pulls it back to VL at rate a.
When V > VL, the variance has a negative drift; when V < VL, it has a positive drift.
Superimposed on the drift is a volatility . Chapter 27 discusses this type of model
further.
23.4
CHOOSING BETWEEN THE MODELS
In practice, variance rates do tend to be mean reverting. The GARCH(1,1) model
incorporates mean reversion, whereas the EWMA model does not. GARCH (1,1) is
therefore theoretically more appealing than the EWMA model.
548
CHAPTER 23

In the next section, we will discuss how best-ﬁt parameters !, , and  in GARCH(1,1)
can be estimated. When the parameter ! is zero, the GARCH(1,1) reduces to EWMA. In
circumstances where the best-ﬁt value of ! turns out to be negative, the GARCH(1,1)
model is not stable and it makes sense to switch to the EWMA model.
23.5
MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD METHODS
It is now appropriate to discuss how the parameters in the models we have been
considering are estimated from historical data. The approach used is known as the
maximum likelihood method. It involves choosing values for the parameters that
maximize the chance (or likelihood) of the data occurring.
To illustrate the method, we start with a very simple example. Suppose that we
sample 10 stocks at random on a certain day and ﬁnd that the price of one of them
declined on that day and the prices of the other nine either remained the same or
increased. What is the best estimate of the probability of a stock’s price declining on the
day? The natural answer is 0.1. Let us see if this is what the maximum likelihood
method gives.
Suppose that the probability of a price decline is p. The probability that one
particular stock declines in price and the other nine do not is pð1  pÞ9. Using the
maximum likelihood approach, the best estimate of p is the one that maximizes
pð1  pÞ9. Diﬀerentiating this expression with respect to p and setting the result equal
to zero, we ﬁnd that p ¼ 0:1 maximizes the expression. This shows that the maximum
likelihood estimate of p is 0.1, as expected.
Estimating a Constant Variance
Our next example of maximum likelihood methods considers the problem of estimating
the variance of a variable X from m observations on X when the underlying distribution
is normal with zero mean. Assume that the observations are u1, u2, . . . , um. Denote the
variance by v. The likelihood of ui being observed is deﬁned as the probability density
function for X when X ¼ ui. This is

Using the maximum likelihood method, the best estimate of v is the value that

Maximizing an expression is equivalent to maximizing the logarithm of the expres-
sion. Taking logarithms of the expression in equation (23.10) and ignoring constant
multiplicative factors, it can be seen that we wish to maximize

Estimating EWMA or GARCH (1,1) Parameters
We now consider how the maximum likelihood method can be used to estimate the
parameters when EWMA, GARCH (1,1), or some other volatility updating scheme is
used. Deﬁne vi ¼ 2

The spreadsheet in Table 23.1 indicates how the calculations could be organized for
the GARCH(1,1) model. The table analyzes data on the S&P 500 between July 18, 2005,

counts the days. The third column shows the S&P 500, Si, at the end of day i. The fourth
column shows the proportional change in the S&P 500 between the end of day i  1 and
the end of day i. This is ui ¼ ðSi  Si1Þ=Si1. The ﬁfth column shows the estimate of the
variance rate, vi ¼ 2
i , for day i made at the end of day i  1. On day 3, we start things oﬀ
by setting the variance equal to u2
2. On subsequent days, equation (23.9) is used. The
sixth column tabulates the likelihood measure,  lnðviÞ  u2
i =vi. The values in the ﬁfth
and sixth columns are based on the current trial estimates of !, , and . We are
interested in choosing !, , and  to maximize the sum of the numbers in the sixth
column. This involves an iterative search procedure.11

In our example, the optimal values of the parameters turn out to be
! ¼ 0:0000013465;
 ¼ 0:083394;
 ¼ 0:910116
and the maximum value of the function in equation (23.12) is 10,228.2349. The
numbers shown in Table 23.1 were calculated on the ﬁnal iteration of the search for
the optimal !, , and .

, or 1.4404%, per day.
Figures 23.1 and 23.2 show the S&P 500 index and its GARCH(1,1) volatility during
the 5-year period covered by the data. Most of the time, the volatility was less than 2%
per day, but volatilities as high as 5% per day were experienced during the credit crisis.
(Very high volatilities are also indicated by the VIX index—see Section 15.11.)
An alternative approach to estimating parameters in GARCH(1,1), which is sometimes
more robust, is known as variance targeting.12 This involves setting the long-run average
variance rate, VL, equal to the sample variance calculated from the data (or to some other
value that is believed to be reasonable). The value of ! then equals VLð1    Þ and only
two parameters have to be estimated. For the data in Table 23.1, the sample variance is
0.0002412, which gives a daily volatility of 1.5531%. Setting VL equal to the sample
variance, the values of  and  that maximize the objective function in equation (23.12)
are 0.08445 and 0.9101, respectively. The value of the objective function is 10,228.1941,
only marginally below the value of 10,228.2349 obtained using the earlier procedure.

When the EWMA model is used, the estimation procedure is relatively simple. We set
! ¼ 0,  ¼ 1  , and  ¼ , and only one parameter has to be estimated. In the data in
Table 23.1, the value of  that maximizes the objective function in equation (23.12) is
0.9374 and the value of the objective function is 10,192.5104.
For both GARCH (1,1) and EWMA, we can use the Solver routine in Excel to search
for the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. The routine
works well provided that the spreadsheet is structured so that the parameters being
searched for have roughly equal values. For example, in GARCH (1,1) we could let cells

A1, A2, and A3 contain !  105, 10, and . We could then set B1=A1/100,000,
B2=A2/10, and B3=A3. We would use B1, B2, and B3 to calculate the likelihood
function. We would ask Solver to calculate the values of A1, A2, and A3 that maximize
the likelihood function. Occasionally Solver gives a local maximum, so testing a number
of diﬀerent starting values for parameters is a good idea.
How Good Is the Model?
The assumption underlying a GARCH model is that volatility changes with the passage
of time. During some periods volatility is relatively high; during other periods it is
relatively low. To put this another way, when u2
i is high, there is a tendency for u2
iþ1,
u2
iþ2, . . . to be high; when u2
i is low, there is a tendency for u2
iþ1, u2
iþ2, . . . to be low. We
can test how true this is by examining the autocorrelation structure of the u2
i .
Let us assume the u2
i do exhibit autocorrelation. If a GARCH model is working well, it
should remove the autocorrelation. We can test whether it has done so by considering the
autocorrelation structure for the variables u2
i =2
i . If these show very little autocorrelation,
our model for i has succeeded in explaining autocorrelations in the u2
i .
Table 23.2 shows results for the S&P 500 data used above. The ﬁrst column shows the
lags considered when the autocorrelation is calculated. The second shows autocorrela-
tions for u2
i ; the third shows autocorrelations for u2
i =2
i .13 The table shows that the
autocorrelations are positive for u2
i for all lags between 1 and 15. In the case of u2
i =2
i ,
some of the autocorrelations are positive and some are negative. They are all much
smaller in magnitude than the autocorrelations for u2
i .

The GARCH model appears to have done a good job in explaining the data. For a
more scientiﬁc test, we can use what is known as the Ljung–Box statistic.14 If a certain
series has m observations the Ljung–Box statistic is
m
X
K
k¼1
wk 	2
k
where 	k is the autocorrelation for a lag of k, K is the number of lags considered, and
wk ¼ m þ 2
m  k
For K ¼ 15, zero autocorrelation can be rejected with 95% conﬁdence when the Ljung–
Box statistic is greater than 25.
From Table 23.2, the Ljung–Box statistic for the u2
i series is about 1,566. This is
strong evidence of autocorrelation. For the u2
i =2
i series, the Ljung–Box statistic is 21.7,
suggesting that the autocorrelation has been largely removed by the GARCH model.
23.6
USING GARCH(1,1) TO FORECAST FUTURE VOLATILITY
The variance rate estimated at the end of day n  1 for day n, when GARCH(1,1) is
used, is
2
n ¼ ð1    ÞVL þ u2
n1 þ 2
n1
so that
2
n  VL ¼ ðu2
n1  VLÞ þ ð2

On day n þ t in the future,
2
nþt  VL ¼ ðu2
nþt1  VLÞ þ ð2
nþt1  VLÞ
The expected value of u2
nþt1 is 2
nþt1. Hence,
E½2
nþt  VL ¼ ð þ ÞE½2
nþt1  VL
where E denotes expected value. Using this equation repeatedly yields
E½2
nþt  VL ¼ ð þ Þtð2
n  VLÞ
or
E½2
nþt ¼ VL þ ð þ Þtð2
n  VLÞ
ð23:13Þ
This equation forecasts the volatility on day n þ t using the information available at the
end of day n  1. In the EWMA model,  þ  ¼ 1 and equation (23.13) shows that the
expected future variance rate equals the current variance rate. When  þ  < 1, the ﬁnal
term in the equation becomes progressively smaller as t increases. Figure 23.3 shows the
expected path followed by the variance rate for situations where the current variance
rate is diﬀerent from VL. As mentioned earlier, the variance rate exhibits mean reversion
with a reversion level of VL and a reversion rate of 1    . Our forecast of the future

CHAPTER 23

variance rate tends towards VL as we look further and further ahead. This analysis
emphasizes the point that we must have  þ  < 1 for a stable GARCH(1,1) process.
When  þ  > 1, the weight given to the long-term average variance is negative and the
process is ‘‘mean ﬂeeing’’ rather than ‘‘mean reverting’’.
For the S&P 500 data considered earlier,  þ  ¼ 0:9935 and VL ¼ 0:0002075.
Suppose that the estimate of the current variance rate per day is 0.0003. (This
corresponds to a volatility of 1.732% per day.) In 10 days, the expected variance rate is
0:0002075 þ 0:993510ð0:0003  0:0002075Þ ¼ 0:0002942
The expected volatility per day is 1.72%, still well above the long-term volatility of
1.44% per day. However, the expected variance rate in 500 days is
0:0002075 þ 0:9935500ð0:0003  0:0002075Þ ¼ 0:0002110
and the expected volatility per day is 1.45%, very close to the long-term volatility.

and
a ¼ ln

so that equation (23.13) becomes
VðtÞ ¼ VL þ eat½Vð0Þ  VL
Here, VðtÞ is an estimate of the instantaneous variance rate in t days. The average

As discussed in Chapter 20, the market prices of diﬀerent options on the same asset are
often used to calculate a volatility term structure. This is the relationship between the
implied volatilities of the options and their maturities. Equation (23.14) can be used to
estimate a volatility term structure based on the GARCH(1,1) model. The estimated
volatility term structure is not usually the same as the implied volatility term structure.
However, as we will show, it is often used to predict the way that the implied volatility
term structure will respond to volatility changes.
When the current volatility is above the long-term volatility, the GARCH(1,1)
model estimates a downward-sloping volatility term structure. When the current
volatility is below the long-term volatility, it estimates an upward-sloping volatility
term structure. In the case of the S&P 500 data, a ¼ lnð1=0:99351Þ ¼ 0:006511 and
VL ¼ 0:0002075. Suppose that the current variance rate per day, Vð0Þ, is estimated as
0.0003 per day. It follows from equation (23.14) that

CHAPTER 23

Table 23.4 shows the eﬀect of a volatility change on options of varying maturities for
the S&P 500 data considered above. We assume as before that Vð0Þ ¼ 0:0003, so that

¼ 27:50%. The table considers a 100-basis-point change in the
instantaneous volatility from 27.50% per year to 28.50% per year. This means that
ð0Þ ¼ 0:01, or 1%.
Many ﬁnancial institutions use analyses such as this when determining the exposure
of their books to volatility changes. Rather than consider an across-the-board increase
of 1% in implied volatilities when calculating vega, they relate the size of the volatility
increase that is considered to the maturity of the option. Based on Table 23.4, a 0.97%
volatility increase would be considered for a 10-day option, a 0.92% increase for a
30-day option, a 0.87% increase for a 50-day option, and so on.
23.7
CORRELATIONS
The discussion so far has centered on the estimation and forecasting of volatility. As
explained in Chapter 22, correlations also play a key role in the calculation of VaR. In
this section, we show how correlation estimates can be updated in a similar way to
volatility estimates.
The correlation between two variables X and Y can be deﬁned as
covðX; YÞ
XY
where X and Y are the standard deviations of X and Y and covðX; YÞ is the covariance
between X and Y. The covariance between X and Y is deﬁned as
E½ðX  
XÞðY  
YÞ
where 
X and 
Y are the means of X and Y, and E denotes the expected value.
Although it is easier to develop intuition about the meaning of a correlation than it
is for a covariance, it is covariances that are the fundamental variables of our analysis.15
Deﬁne xi and yi as the percentage changes in X and Y between the end of day i  1
and the end of day i:
xi ¼ Xi  Xi1
Xi1
;
yi ¼ Yi  Yi1
Yi1
where Xi and Yi are the values of X and Y at the end of day i. We also deﬁne the
Table 23.4

procedures in the ﬁrst part of this chapter, even though volatilities are easier to understand.

following:
x;n: Daily volatility of variable X, estimated for day n
y;n: Daily volatility of variable Y, estimated for day n
covn: Estimate of covariance between daily changes in X and Y, calculated on day n.
The estimate of the correlation between X and Y on day n is
covn
x;n y;n
Using equal weighting and assuming that the means of xi and yi are zero, equation (23.3)
shows that the variance rates of X and Y can be estimated from the most recent m
observations as
2

One alternative for updating covariances is an EWMA model similar to equation (23.7).
The formula for updating the covariance estimate is then
covn ¼  covn1 þð1  Þxn1 yn1
A similar analysis to that presented for the EWMA volatility model shows that the
weights given to observations on the xi yi decline as we move back through time. The
lower the value of , the greater the weight that is given to recent observations.
Example 23.3
Suppose that  ¼ 0:95 and that the estimate of the correlation between two
variables X and Y on day n  1 is 0.6. Suppose further that the estimate of the
volatilities for the X and Y on day n  1 are 1% and 2%, respectively. From the
relationship between correlation and covariance, the estimate of the covariance
between the X and Y on day n  1 is
0:6  0:01  0:02 ¼ 0:00012
Suppose that the percentage changes in X and Y on day n  1 are 0.5% and 2.5%,
respectively. The variance and covariance for day n would be updated as follows:
2
x;n ¼ 0:95  0:012 þ 0:05  0:0052 ¼ 0:00009625
2
y;n ¼ 0:95  0:022 þ 0:05  0:0252 ¼ 0:00041125
covn ¼ 0:95  0:00012 þ 0:05  0:005  0:025 ¼ 0:00012025
The new volatility of X is
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:00009625
p
¼ 0:981% and the new volatility of Y is
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:00041125
p
¼ 2:028%. The new coeﬃcient of correlation between X and Y is
0:00012025
0:00981  0:02028 ¼ 0:6044
558
CHAPTER 23

GARCH models can also be used for updating covariance estimates and forecasting the
future level of covariances. For example, the GARCH(1,1) model for updating a
covariance is
covn ¼ ! þ xn1 yn1 þ  covn1
and the long-term average covariance is !=ð1    Þ. Formulas similar to those in
equations (23.13) and (23.14) can be developed for forecasting future covariances and
calculating the average covariance during the life of an option.16
Consistency Condition for Covariances
Once all the variances and covariances have been calculated, a variance–covariance
matrix can be constructed. As explained in Section 22.4, when i 6 ¼ j, the ði; jÞth element
of this matrix shows the covariance between variable i and variable j. When i ¼ j, it
shows the variance of variable i.
Not all variance–covariance matrices are internally consistent. The condition for an
N  N variance–covariance matrix  to be internally consistent is
wTw > 0
ð23:17Þ
for all N  1 vectors w, where wT is the transpose of w. A matrix that satisﬁes this
property is known as positive-semideﬁnite.
To understand why the condition in equation (23.17) must hold, suppose that wT is
½w1; w2; . . . ; wn. The expression wTw is the variance of w1x1 þ w2x2 þ    þ wnxn,
where xi is the value of variable i. As such, it cannot be negative.
To ensure that a positive-semideﬁnite matrix is produced, variances and covariances
should be calculated consistently. For example, if variances are calculated by giving equal
weight to the last m data items, the same should be done for covariances. If variances are
updated using an EWMA model with  ¼ 0:94, the same should be done for covariances.
An example of a variance–covariance matrix that is not internally consistent is

0:9

The variance of each variable is 1.0, and so the covariances are also coeﬃcients of
correlation. The ﬁrst variable is highly correlated with the third variable and the second
variable is highly correlated with the third variable. However, there is no correlation at
all between the ﬁrst and second variables. This seems strange. When w is set equal to
ð1; 1; 1Þ, the condition in equation (23.17) is not satisﬁed, proving that the matrix is
not positive-semideﬁnite.17
16 The ideas in this chapter can be extended to multivariate GARCH models, where an entire variance–
covariance matrix is updated in a consistent way. For a discussion of alternative approaches, see R. Engle and
J. Mezrich, ‘‘GARCH for Groups,’’ Risk, August 1996: 36–40.

APPLICATION OF EWMA TO FOUR-INDEX EXAMPLE
We now return to the example considered in Section 22.2. This involved a portfolio on
September 25, 2008, consisting of a $4 million investment in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, a $3 million investment in the FTSE 100, a $1 million investment in the
CAC 40, and a $2 million investment in the Nikkei 225. Daily returns were collected
over 500 days ending on September 25, 2008. Data and all calculations presented here
can be found at: www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/OFOD/VaRExample.
The correlation matrix that would be calculated on September 25, 2008, by giving
equal weight to the last 500 returns is shown in Table 23.5. The FTSE 100 and CAC 40
are very highly correlated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is moderately highly
correlated with both the FTSE 100 and the CAC 40. The correlation of the Nikkei 225
with other indices is less high.
The covariance matrix for the equal-weight case is shown in Table 23.6. From
equation (22.3), this matrix gives the variance of the portfolio losses ($000s) as
8,761.833. The standard deviation is the square root of this, or 93.60. The one-day
99% VaR in $000s is therefore 2:33  93:60 ¼ 217:757. This is $217,757, which
compares with $253,385, calculated using the historical simulation approach in
Section 22.2.
Instead of calculating variances and covariances by giving equal weight to all observed
returns, we now use the exponentially weighted moving average method with  ¼ 0:94.
This gives the variance–covariance matrix in Table 23.7.18 From equation (22.3), the

18 In the EWMA calculations, the variance was initially set equal to the population variance. This is an
alternative to setting it equal to the ﬁrst squared return as in Table 23.1. The two approaches give similar ﬁnal
variances, and the ﬁnal variance is all we are interested in.

CHAPTER 23

variance of portfolio losses ($000s) is 40,995.765. The standard deviation is the square
root of this, or 202.474. The one-day 99% VaR is therefore
2:33  202:474 ¼ 471:025
This is $471,025, over twice as high as the value given when returns are equally
weighted. Tables 23.8 and 23.9 show the reasons. The standard deviation of a portfolio
consisting of long positions in securities increases with the standard deviations of
security returns and also with the correlations between security returns. Table 23.8
shows that the estimated daily standard deviations are much higher when EWMA is
used than when data are equally weighted. This is because volatilities were much higher
during the period immediately preceding September 25, 2008, than during the rest of
the 500 days covered by the data. Comparing Table 23.9 with Table 23.5, we see that
correlations had also increased.19

Estimating Volatilities and Correlations

SUMMARY
Most popular option pricing models, such as Black–Scholes–Merton, assume that the
volatility of the underlying asset is constant. This assumption is far from perfect. In
practice, the volatility of an asset, like the asset’s price, is a stochastic variable. Unlike
the asset price, it is not directly observable. This chapter has discussed procedures for
attempting to keep track of the current level of volatility.
We deﬁne ui as the percentage change in a market variable between the end of
day i  1 and the end of day i. The variance rate of the market variable (that is, the
square of its volatility) is calculated as a weighted average of the u2
i . The key feature of
the procedures that have been discussed here is that they do not give equal weight to
the observations on the u2
i . The more recent an observation, the greater the weight
assigned to it. In the EWMA and the GARCH(1,1) models, the weights assigned to
observations
decrease
exponentially
as
the
observations
become
older.
The
GARCH(1,1) model diﬀers from the EWMA model in that some weight is also
assigned to the long-run average variance rate. It has a structure that enables forecasts
of the future level of variance rate to be produced relatively easily.
Maximum likelihood methods are usually used to estimate parameters from historical
data in the EWMA, GARCH(1,1), and similar models. These methods involve using an
iterative procedure to determine the parameter values that maximize the chance or
likelihood that the historical data will occur. Once its parameters have been determined,
a GARCH(1,1) model can be judged by how well it removes autocorrelation from the u2
i .
For every model that is developed to track variances, there is a corresponding model
that can be developed to track covariances. The procedures described here can therefore
be used to update the complete variance–covariance matrix used in value at risk
calculations.

the GARCH(1,1) model for updating volatilities?
23.3. The most recent estimate of the daily volatility of an asset is 1.5% and the price of the
asset at the close of trading yesterday was $30.00. The parameter  in the EWMA model
is 0.94. Suppose that the price of the asset at the close of trading today is $30.50. How
will this cause the volatility to be updated by the EWMA model?
23.4. A company uses an EWMA model for forecasting volatility. It decides to change the
parameter  from 0.95 to 0.85. Explain the likely impact on the forecasts.
23.5. The volatility of a certain market variable is 30% per annum. Calculate a 99%
conﬁdence interval for the size of the percentage daily change in the variable.
23.6. A company uses the GARCH(1,1) model for updating volatility. The three parameters
are !, , and . Describe the impact of making a small increase in each of the parameters
while keeping the others ﬁxed.
23.7. The most recent estimate of the daily volatility of the US dollar/sterling exchange rate is
0.6% and the exchange rate at 4 p.m. yesterday was 1.5000. The parameter  in the
EWMA model is 0.9. Suppose that the exchange rate at 4 p.m. today proves to be 1.4950.
How would the estimate of the daily volatility be updated?
23.8. Assume that S&P 500 at close of trading yesterday was 1,040 and the daily volatility of
the index was estimated as 1% per day at that time. The parameters in a GARCH(1,1)
model are ! ¼ 0:000002,  ¼ 0:06, and  ¼ 0:92. If the level of the index at close of
trading today is 1,060, what is the new volatility estimate?
23.9. Suppose that the daily volatilities of asset A and asset B, calculated at the close of trading
yesterday, are 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively. The prices of the assets at close of trading
yesterday were $20 and $40 and the estimate of the coeﬃcient of correlation between the

 ¼ 0:92. What is the long-run average volatility and what is the equation describing the
way that the variance rate reverts to its long-run average? If the current volatility is 20%
per year, what is the expected volatility in 20 days?
23.11. Suppose that the current daily volatilities of asset X and asset Y are 1.0% and 1.2%,
respectively. The prices of the assets at close of trading yesterday were $30 and $50 and
the estimate of the coeﬃcient of correlation between the returns on the two assets made
at this time was 0.50. Correlations and volatilities are updated using a GARCH(1,1)
model. The estimates of the model’s parameters are  ¼ 0:04 and  ¼ 0:94. For the
correlation ! ¼ 0:000001, and for the volatilities ! ¼ 0:000003. If the prices of the two
assets at close of trading today are $31 and $51, how is the correlation estimate
updated?
23.12. Suppose that the daily volatility of the FTSE 100 stock index (measured in pounds
sterling) is 1.8% and the daily volatility of the dollar/sterling exchange rate is 0.9%.
Suppose further that the correlation between the FTSE 100 and the dollar/sterling
exchange rate is 0.4. What is the volatility of the FTSE 100 when it is translated to
US dollars? Assume that the dollar/sterling exchange rate is expressed as the number of

dollars) and the FTSE 100 Index (measured in sterling) is 0.7, the correlation between
the S&P 500 Index (measured in dollars) and the dollar/sterling exchange rate is 0.3, and
the daily volatility of the S&P 500 index is 1.6%. What is the correlation between the
S&P 500 index (measured in dollars) and the FTSE 100 index when it is translated to

Credit Risk
Most of the derivatives considered so far in this book have been concerned with market
risk. In this chapter we consider another important risk for ﬁnancial institutions: credit
risk. Most ﬁnancial institutions devote considerable resources to the measurement and
management of credit risk. Regulators have for many years required banks to keep
capital to reﬂect the credit risks they are bearing.
Credit risk arises from the possibility that borrowers and counterparties in derivatives
transactions may default. This chapter discusses a number of diﬀerent approaches to
estimating the probability that a company will default and explains the key diﬀerence
between risk-neutral and real-world probabilities of default. It examines the nature of
the credit risk in over-the-counter derivatives transactions and discusses the clauses
derivatives dealers write into their contracts to reduce credit risk. It also covers
default correlation, Gaussian copula models, and the estimation of credit value at
risk.
Chapter 25 will discuss credit derivatives and show how ideas introduced in this
chapter can be used to value these instruments.
24.1
CREDIT RATINGS
Rating agencies, such as Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, are in the business of providing
ratings describing the creditworthiness of corporate bonds. The best rating assigned by
Moody’s is Aaa. Bonds with this rating are considered to have almost no chance of
defaulting. The next best rating is Aa. Following that comes A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca,
and C. Only bonds with ratings of Baa or above are considered to be investment grade.
The S&P and Fitch ratings corresponding to Moody’s Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa,
Ca, and C are AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, and C, respectively. To create ﬁner
rating measures, Moody’s divides its Aa rating category into Aa1, Aa2, and Aa3, its A
category into A1, A2, and A3, and so on. Similarly, S&P and Fitch divide their AA
rating category into AAþ, AA, and AA, their A rating category into Aþ, A, and A,
and so on. Moody’s Aaa category and the S&P/Fitch AAA category are not sub-
divided, nor usually are the two lowest rating categories.

24.2
HISTORICAL DEFAULT PROBABILITIES
Table 24.1 is typical of the data produced by rating agencies. It shows the default
experience during a 20-year period of bonds that had a particular rating at the
beginning of the period. For example, a bond with a credit rating of Baa has a
0.177% chance of defaulting by the end of the ﬁrst year, a 0.495% chance of defaulting
by the end of the second year, and so on. The probability of a bond defaulting during a
particular year can be calculated from the table. For example, the probability that a
bond initially rated Baa will default during the second year is 0:495  0:177 ¼ 0:318%.
Table 24.1 shows that, for investment-grade bonds, the probability of default in a
year tends to be an increasing function of time (e.g., the probabilities of an A-rated
bond defaulting during years 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, and 15–20 are 0.870%, 1.610%,
1.775%, and 2.586%, respectively). This is because the bond issuer is initially con-
sidered to be creditworthy, and the more time that elapses, the greater the possibility
that its ﬁnancial health will decline. For bonds with a poor credit rating, the probability
of default is often a decreasing function of time (e.g., the probabilities that a B-rated
bond will default during years 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, and 15–20 are 24.613%, 17.334%,
10.270%, and 5.867%, respectively). The reason here is that, for a bond with a poor
credit rating, the next year or two may be critical. The longer the issuer survives, the
greater the chance that its ﬁnancial health improves.
Hazard Rates
From Table 24.1 we can calculate the probability of a bond rated Caa or below
defaulting during the third year as 36:908  27:867 ¼ 9:041%. We will refer to this as
the unconditional default probability. It is the probability of default during the third year
as seen today. The probability that the bond will survive until the end of year 2 is
100  27:867 ¼ 72:133%. The probability that it will default during the third year
conditional on no earlier default is therefore 0:09041=0:72133, or 12.53%.
The 12.53% we have just calculated is a conditional probability for a 1-year time
period. Suppose instead that we consider a short time period of length t. The hazard
rate ðtÞ at time t is deﬁned so that ðtÞ t is the probability of default between time t
and t þ t conditional on no earlier default.
If VðtÞ is the cumulative probability of the company surviving to time t (i.e., no
default by time t), the conditional probability of default between time t and t þ t is

RECOVERY RATES
When a company goes bankrupt, those that are owed money by the company ﬁle claims
against the assets of the company.1 Sometimes there is a reorganization in which these
creditors agree to a partial payment of their claims. In other cases the assets are sold by
the liquidator and the proceeds are used to meet the claims as far as possible. Some
claims typically have priority over other claims and are met more fully.
The recovery rate for a bond is normally deﬁned as the bond’s market value a few
days after a default, as a percent of its face value. Table 24.2 provides historical data on
average recovery rates for diﬀerent categories of bonds. The average recovery rate ranges
from 51.6% for bonds that are both senior to other lenders and secured to 24.7% for
bonds that rank after other lenders with a security interest that is subordinate to other
lenders.

CHAPTER 24

The Dependence of Recovery Rates on Default Rates
In Chapter 8, we saw that one of the lessons from the credit crisis of 2007 is that the
average recovery rate on mortgages is negatively related to the mortgage default rate. As
the mortgage default rate increases, foreclosures lead to more houses being oﬀered for
sale and a decline in house prices. This in turn results in a decline in recovery rates.
The average recovery rate on corporate bonds exhibits a similar negative dependence
on default rates.2 In a year when the number of bonds defaulting is low, economic
conditions are usually good and the average recovery rate on those bonds that do default
might be as high as 60%; in a year when the default rate on corporate bonds is high,
economic conditions are usually poor and the average recovery rate on the defaulting
bonds might be as low as 30%. The result of the negative dependence is that a bad year
for defaults is doubly bad for a lender because it is usually accompanied by a low
recovery rate.
24.4
ESTIMATING DEFAULT PROBABILITIES FROM BOND
YIELD SPREADS
Tables such as Table 24.1 provide one way of estimating default probabilities. Another
approach is to look at bond yield spreads. A bond’s yield spread is the excess of the
promised yield on the bond over the risk-free rate. The usual assumption is that the
excess yield is compensation for the possibility of default.3
Suppose that the bond yield spread for a T-year bond is sðTÞ per annum. This means
that the average loss rate on the bond between time 0 and time T should be approxi-
mately sðTÞ per annum. Suppose that the average hazard rate during this time is ðTÞ.
Another expression for the average loss rate is ðTÞð1  RÞ, where R is the estimated
recovery rate. This means that it is approximately true that
ðTÞð1  RÞ ¼ sðTÞ
or
ðTÞ ¼ sðTÞ
1  R
ð24:2Þ
The approximation works very well in a wide range of situations.
Example 24.1
Suppose that 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year bonds issued by a corporation yield 150,
180, and 195 basis points more than the risk-free rate, respectively. If the recovery
rate is estimated at 40%, the average hazard rate for year 1 given by equa-
tion (24.2) is 0:0150=ð1  0:4Þ ¼ 0:025 or 2.5% per annum. Similarly, the average
hazard rate for years 1 and 2 is 0:0180=ð1  0:4Þ ¼ 0:030 or 3.0% per annum, and
the average hazard rate for all three years is 0:0195=ð1  0:4Þ ¼ 0:0325 or 3.25%.
These results imply that the average hazard rate for the second year is

its liquidity. The lower the liquidity, the lower its price.

third year is 3  0:0325  2  0:03 ¼ 0:0375 or 3.75%.
Matching Bond Prices
For a more precise calculation we can choose hazard rates so that they match bond
prices. The approach is similar to the bootstrap method for calculating a zero-coupon
yield curve described in Section 4.5. Suppose that bonds with maturities ti are used,
where t1 < t2 < t3    . The shortest maturity bond is used to calculate the hazard rate
out to time t1. The next shortest maturity bond is used to calculate the hazard between
times t1 and t2, and so on.
Example 24.2
Suppose that the risk-free rate is 5% per annum (continuously compounded) for
all maturities and 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year bonds have yields of 6.5%, 6.8%,
and 6.95%, respectively (also continuously compounded). (This is consistent with
the data in Example 24.1.) We suppose that each bond has a face value of $100
and provides semiannual coupons at the rate of 8% per year (with a coupon
having just been paid). The values of the bonds can be calculated from their
yields as $101.33, $101.99, and $102.47. If the bonds were risk-free the bond
values (obtained by discounting cash ﬂows at 5%) would be $102.83, $105.52,
and $108.08, respectively. This means that the present value of expected default
losses on the 1-year bond must be $102:83  $101:33 ¼ $1:50. Similarly, the
present value of expected default losses on the 2-year and 3-year bonds must
be $3.53 and $5.61. Suppose that the hazard rate in year i is i (1 6 i 6 3) and
the recovery rate is 40%.
Consider the 1-year bond. The probability of a default in the ﬁrst 6 months is
1  e0:51 and the probability of a default during the following 6 months is
e0:51  e1. We assume that defaults can happen only at the midpoints of
these 6-month intervals. The possible default times are therefore in 3 months
and 9 months. The (forward) risk-free value of the bond at the 3-month point is
4e0:050:25 þ 104e0:050:75 ¼ $104:12
Given the deﬁnition of recovery rate in the previous section, if there is a default
the bond will be worth $40. The present value of the loss if there is a default at the
3-month point is therefore
ð104:12  40Þe0:050:25 ¼ $63:33
The risk-free value of the bond at the 9-month point is 104e0:050:25 ¼ $102:71.
If there is a default, the bond will be worth $40. The present value of a loss if there
is a default at the 9-month point is therefore
ð102:71  40Þe0:050:75 ¼ $60:40
The hazard rate 1 must therefore satisfy
ð1  e0:51Þ  63:33 þ ðe0:51  e1Þ  60:40 ¼ 1:50
The solution to this (e.g., by using Solver in Excel) is 1 ¼ 2:46%.

CHAPTER 24

The 2-year bond is considered next. Its default probabilities at times 3 months
and 9 months are known from the analysis of the 1-year bond. The hazard rate for
the second year is calculated so that the present value of the expected loss on the
bond is $3.53. The 3-year bond is treated similarly. The hazard rate for the second
and third years prove to be 3.48% and 3.74%. (Note that the three estimated
hazard rates are very similar to those calculated in Example 24.1 using equa-
tion (24.2)) A worksheet showing the calculations is on the author’s website.
The Risk-Free Rate
The methods we have just presented for calculating default probabilities are critically
dependent on the choice of a risk-free rate. The spreads in Example 24.1 are diﬀerences
between bond yields and risk-free rates. The calculation of the expected losses from
default implied by bond prices in Example 24.2 depends on calculating the prices of
risk-free bonds. The benchmark risk-free rate used by bond traders is usually a
Treasury rate. For example, a bond trader might quote the yield on a bond as being
a spread of 250 basis points over Treasuries. However, as discussed in Section 9.1,
Treasury rates are too low to be useful proxies for risk-free rates.
Credit default swap (CDS) spreads, which were brieﬂy explained in Section 7.11 and
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 25, provide a credit spread estimate that does
not depend on the risk-free rate. A number of researchers have attempted to imply risk-
free rates by comparing bond yields to CDS spreads. The evidence is that the implied
risk-free rate is close to the corresponding LIBOR/swap rate. For example, one estimate
puts implied risk-free rates at about 10 basis points below LIBOR/swap rates.4
Asset Swap Spreads
In practice, the LIBOR/swap rate is often used as the risk-free benchmark when credit
calculations are carried out. Asset swap spreads provide a useful direct estimate of the
spread of bond yields over the LIBOR/swap curve.
To explain how asset swaps work, consider the situation where an asset swap spread
for a particular bond is quoted as 150 basis points. There are three possible situations:
1. The bond sells for its par value of 100. The swap then involves one side
(company A) paying the coupon on the bond and the other side (company B)
paying LIBOR plus 150 basis points. Note that it is the promised coupons that are
exchanged. The exchanges take place regardless of whether the bond defaults.
2. The bond sells below its par value, say, for 95. The swap is then structured so that,
in addition to the coupons, company A pays $5 per $100 of notional principal at
the outset. Company B pays LIBOR plus 150 basis points.
3. The underlying bond sells above par, say, for 108. The swap is then structured so
that, in addition to LIBOR plus 150 basis points, company B makes a payment
of $8 per $100 of principal at the outset. Company A pays the coupons.
The eﬀect of all this is that the present value of the asset swap spread is the amount by
which the price of the corporate bond is exceeded by the price of a similar risk-free

Yields, and Credit Rating Announcements,’’ Journal of Banking and Finance, 28 (November 2004): 2789–2811.

bond where the risk-free rate is assumed to be given by the LIBOR/swap curve (see
Problem 24.20). This result is useful for calculations such as those in Example 24.2.
24.5
COMPARISON OF DEFAULT PROBABILITY ESTIMATES
The default probabilities estimated from historical data are usually much less than those
derived from bond yield spreads. The diﬀerence between the two was particularly large
during the credit crisis which started in mid-2007. This is because there was what is
termed a ‘‘ﬂight to quality’’ during the crisis, where all investors wanted to hold safe
securities such as Treasury bonds. The prices of corporate bonds declined, thereby
increasing their yields. The credit spread on these bonds increased and calculations such
as the one in equation (24.2) gave very high default probability estimates.
Table 24.3 shows the diﬀerence between default probability estimates calculated from
historical data and those implied from credit spreads. To avoid results being heavily
inﬂuenced by the crisis period, it uses only pre-crisis data in calculating estimates from
bond yield spreads.
The second column of Table 24.3 is based on the 7-year column of Table 24.1. (We
use the 7-year column because the bonds we will look at later have a life of about
7 years.) To explain the calculations, note that equation (24.1) gives
ð7Þ ¼  1
7 ln½1  Qð7Þ
where ðtÞ is the average hazard rate by time t and QðtÞ is the cumulative probability of
default by time t. The values of Qð7Þ for diﬀerent rating categories are in Table 24.1.
For example, for an A-rated company, Qð7Þ is 0.01441. The average 7-year hazard rate
is therefore
ð7Þ ¼  1
7 lnð1  0:01441Þ ¼ 0:0021
or 0.21%.
To calculate average hazard rates from bond yields in the third column of Table 24.3,
we use equation (24.2) and bond yields published by Merrill Lynch. The results shown
are averages between December 1996 and June 2007. The recovery rate is assumed to be
40%. The Merrill Lynch bonds have a life of about seven years. (This explains why we
focused on the 7-year column in Table 24.1 when calculating historical default

probabilities.) To calculate the bond yield spread, we assume, as discussed in the
previous section, that the risk-free interest rate is the 7-year swap rate minus 10 basis
points. For example, for A-rated bonds, the average Merrill Lynch yield was 5.995%.
The average 7-year swap rate was 5.408%, so that the average risk-free rate was
5.308%. This gives the average 7-year hazard rate as
0:05995  0:05308
1  0:4
¼ 0:0115
or 1.15%.
Table 24.3 shows that the ratio of the hazard rate backed out from bond prices to the
hazard rate calculated from historical data is very high for investment-grade companies
and tends to decline as a company’s credit rating declines.5 The diﬀerence between the
two hazard rates tends to increase as the credit rating declines.
Table 24.4 provides another way of looking at these results. It shows the excess return
over the risk-free rate (still assumed to be the 7-year swap rate minus 10 basis points)
earned by investors in bonds with diﬀerent credit rating. Consider again an A-rated
bond. The average spread over 7-year Treasuries is 111 basis points. Of this, 42 basis
points are accounted for by the average spread between 7-year Treasuries and our proxy
for the risk-free rate. A spread of 12 basis points is necessary to cover expected defaults.
(This equals the historical hazard rate from Table 24.3 multiplied by 0.6 to allow for
recoveries.) This leaves an excess return (after expected defaults have been taken into
account) of 57 basis points.
Tables 24.3 and 24.4 show that a large percentage diﬀerence between default
probability estimates translates into a small (but signiﬁcant) excess return on the bond.
For Aaa-rated bonds, the ratio of the two hazard rates is 17.0, but the expected excess
return is only 34 basis points. The excess return tends to increase as credit quality
declines.6
The excess return in Table 24.4 does not remain constant through time. Credit
spreads, and therefore excess returns, were high in 2001, 2002, and the ﬁrst half of
2003. After that they were fairly low until the credit crisis.

Real-World vs. Risk-Neutral Probabilities
The default probabilities or hazard rates implied from credit spreads are risk-neutral
estimates. They can be used to calculate expected cash ﬂows in a risk-neutral world
when there is credit risk. The value of the cash ﬂows is obtained using risk-neutral
valuation by discounting the expected cash ﬂows at a risk-free rate. Example 24.2 shows
an application of this to the calculation of the cost of defaults. We will see more
applications in the next chapter.
Default probabilities or hazard rates calculated from historical data are real-world
(sometimes termed physical) default probabilities. Table 24.3 shows that risk-neutral
default probabilities are much higher than real world default probabilities. The expected
excess return in Table 24.4 arises directly from the diﬀerence between real-world and
risk-neutral default probabilities. If there were no expected excess return, then the real-
world and risk-neutral default probabilities would be the same, and vice versa.
Why do we see such big diﬀerences between real-world and risk-neutral default
probabilities? As we have just argued, this is the same as asking why corporate bond
traders earn more than the risk-free rate on average.
One reason often advanced for the results is that corporate bonds are relatively
illiquid and the returns on bonds are higher than they would otherwise be to
compensate for this. This is true, but research shows that it does not fully explain the
results in Table 24.4.7 Another possible reason for the results is that the subjective
default probabilities of bond traders may be much higher than the those given in
Table 24.1. Bond traders may be allowing for depression scenarios much worse than
anything seen during the period covered by historical data. However, it is diﬃcult to see
how this can explain a large part of the excess return that is observed.
By far the most important reason for the results in Tables 24.3 and 24.4 is that bonds
do not default independently of each other. There are periods of time when default
rates are very low and periods of time when they are very high. Evidence for this can be
obtained by looking at the default rates in diﬀerent years. Moody’s statistics show that
since 1970 the default rate per year has ranged from a low of 0.09% in 1979 to highs of
3.97% and 5.35% in 2001 and 2009, respectively. The year-to-year variation in default
rates gives rise to systematic risk (i.e., risk that cannot be diversiﬁed away) and bond
traders earn an excess expected return for bearing the risk. (This is similar to the excess
expected return earned by equity holders that is calculated by the capital asset pricing
model—see the appendix to Chapter 3.) The variation in default rates from year to year
may be because of overall economic conditions and it may be because a default by one
company has a ripple eﬀect resulting in defaults by other companies. (The latter is
referred to by researchers as credit contagion.)
In addition to the systematic risk we have just talked about, there is nonsystematic (or
idiosyncratic) risk associated with each bond. If we were talking about stocks, we would
argue that investors can to a large extent diversify away the nonsystematic risk by
choosing a portfolio of, say, 30 stocks. They should not therefore demand a risk premium
for bearing nonsystematic risk. For bonds, the arguments are not so clear-cut. Bond
returns are highly skewed with limited upside. (For example, on an individual bond, there
7 For example, J. Dick-Nielsen, P. Feldhu¨ tter, and D. Lando, ‘‘Corporate Bond Liquidity before and after the
Onset of the Subprime Crisis,’’ Journal of Financial Economics, 103, 3 (2012), 471–92, uses a number of diﬀerent
liquidity measures and a large database of bond trades. It shows that the liquidity component of credit spreads
is relatively small.
574
CHAPTER 24

might be a 99.75% chance of a 7% return in a year, and a 0.25% chance of a 60%
return in the year, the ﬁrst outcome corresponding to no default and the second to
default.) This type of risk is diﬃcult to ‘‘diversify away’’.8 It would require tens of
thousands of diﬀerent bonds. In practice, many bond portfolios are far from fully
diversiﬁed. As a result, bond traders may earn an extra return for bearing nonsystematic
risk as well as for bearing the systematic risk mentioned in the previous paragraph.
Which Default Probability Estimate Should Be Used?
At this stage it is natural to ask whether we should use real-world or risk-neutral default
probabilities in the analysis of credit risk. The answer depends on the purpose of the
analysis. When valuing credit derivatives or estimating the impact of default risk on the
pricing of instruments, risk-neutral default probabilities should be used. This is because
the analysis calculates the present value of expected future cash ﬂows and almost
invariably (implicitly or explicitly) involves using risk-neutral valuation. When carrying
out scenario analyses to calculate potential future losses from defaults, real-world
default probabilities should be used.
24.6
USING EQUITY PRICES TO ESTIMATE DEFAULT PROBABILITIES
When we use a table such as Table 24.1 to estimate a company’s real-world probability
of default, we are relying on the company’s credit rating. Unfortunately, credit ratings
are revised relatively infrequently. This has led some analysts to argue that equity prices
can provide more up-to-date information for estimating default probabilities.
In 1974, Merton proposed a model where a company’s equity is an option on the
assets of the company.9 Suppose, for simplicity, that a ﬁrm has one zero-coupon bond
outstanding and that the bond matures at time T. Deﬁne:
V0: Value of company’s assets today
VT : Value of company’s assets at time T
E0: Value of company’s equity today
ET : Value of company’s equity at time T
D: Debt repayment due at time T
V : Volatility of assets (assumed constant)
E: Instantaneous volatility of equity.
If VT < D, it is (at least in theory) rational for the company to default on the debt at
time T. The value of the equity is then zero. If VT > D, the company should make the
debt repayment at time T and the value of the equity at this time is VT  D. Merton’s
model, therefore, gives the value of the ﬁrm’s equity at time T as
ET ¼ maxðVT  D; 0Þ
This shows that the equity is a call option on the value of the assets with a strike price

equal to the repayment required on the debt. The Black–Scholes–Merton formula gives

The value of the debt today is V0  E0.
The risk-neutral probability that the company will default on the debt is Nðd2Þ. To
calculate this, we require V0 and V. Neither of these are directly observable. However,
if the company is publicly traded, we can observe E0. This means that equation (24.3)
provides one condition that must be satisﬁed by V0 and V. We can also estimate E
from historical data or options. From Itoˆ ’s lemma,
EE0 ¼ @E
@V VV0 ¼ Nðd1ÞVV0
ð24:4Þ
This provides another equation that must be satisﬁed by V0 and V. Equations (24.3)
and (24.4) provide a pair of simultaneous equations that can be solved for V0 and V.10
Example 24.3
The value of a company’s equity is $3 million and the volatility of the equity is
80%. The debt that will have to be paid in 1 year is $10 million. The risk-free rate
is 5% per annum. In this case E0 ¼ 3, E ¼ 0:80, r ¼ 0:05, T ¼ 1, and D ¼ 10.
Solving equations (24.3) and (24.4) yields V0 ¼ 12:40 and V ¼ 0:2123. The par-
ameter d2 is 1.1408, so that the probability of default is Nðd2Þ ¼ 0:127, or 12.7%.
The market value of the debt is V0  E0, or 9.40. The present value of the
promised payment on the debt is 10e0:051 ¼ 9:51. The expected loss on the debt
is therefore ð9:51  9:40Þ=9:51, or about 1.2% of its no-default value. The expected
loss (EL) equals the probability of default (PD) times one minus the recovery rate.
It follows that the recovery rate equals one minus EL/PD. In this case, the recovery
rate is 1  1:2=12:7, or about 91%, of the debt’s no-default value.
The basic Merton model we have just presented has been extended in a number of ways.
For example, one version of the model assumes that a default occurs whenever the
value of the assets falls below a barrier level. Another allows payments on debt
instruments to be required at more than one time.
How well do the default probabilities produced by Merton’s model and its extensions
correspond to actual default experience? The answer is that Merton’s model and its
extensions produce a good ranking of default probabilities (risk-neutral or real-world).
This means that a monotonic transformation can be used to convert the probability of
default output from Merton’s model into a good estimate of either the real-world or
risk-neutral default probability.11 It may seem strange to take a default probability
10 To solve two nonlinear equations of the form Fðx; yÞ ¼ 0 and Gðx; yÞ ¼ 0, the Solver routine in Excel can
be asked to ﬁnd the values of x and y that minimize ½Fðx; yÞ2 þ ½Gðx; yÞ2.
11 Moody’s KMV provides a service that transforms a default probability produced by Merton’s model into a
real-world default probability (which it refers to as an expected default frequency, or EDF). CreditGrades use
Merton’s model to estimate credit spreads, which are closely linked to risk-neutral default probabilities.

CHAPTER 24

Nðd2Þ that is in theory a risk-neutral default probability (because it is calculated from
an option-pricing model) and use it to estimate a real-world default probability. Given
the nature of the calibration process we have just described, the underlying assumption
is that the ranking of the risk-neutral default probabilities of diﬀerent companies is the
same as the ranking of their real-world default probabilities.
24.7
CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS
In this section we consider how credit risk is quantiﬁed for bilaterally cleared derivatives
transactions. Typically, bilaterally cleared derivatives between two companies are
governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master
Agreement. One important provision of this agreement is netting. This states that all
outstanding transactions are treated as a single transaction for the purposes of
(a) calculating claims in the event of a default and (b) calculating the collateral which
must be posted.
The Master Agreement deﬁnes the circumstances when an event of default occurs. For
example, when one side fails to make payments on outstanding derivatives transactions
as required or fails to post collateral as required or declares bankruptcy, there is an
event of default. The other side then has the right to terminate all outstanding trans-
actions. There are two circumstances when this is likely to lead to a loss for the
nondefaulting party:
1. The total value of the transactions to the nondefaulting party is positive and
greater than the collateral (if any) posted by the defaulting party. The nondefault-
ing party is then an unsecured creditor for the uncollateralized value of the
transactions.
2. The total value of the transactions is positive to the defaulting party and the
collateral posted by the nondefaulting party is greater than this value. The
nondefaulting party is then an unsecured creditor for the return of the excess
collateral it has posted.
For the purposes of our discussion, we ignore the bid–oﬀer spread costs incurred by the
nondefaulting party when it replaces the transactions it had with the defaulting party.
CVA and DVA
CVA and DVA were introduced in Chapter 9. A bank’s credit value adjustment (CVA)
for a counterparty is the present value of the expected cost to the bank of a default by
the counterparty. Its debit (or debt) value adjustment (DVA) is the present value of the
cost to the counterparty of a default by the bank. The possibility of the bank defaulting
is a beneﬁt to the bank because it means that there is some possibility that the bank will
not have to make payments as required on its derivatives. DVA, a cost to the counter-
party, is therefore a beneﬁt to the bank.
The no-default value of outstanding transactions is their value assuming neither side
will default. (Derivatives pricing models such as Black–Scholes–Merton provide no-

transactions with the counterparty, the value the outstanding transactions when

possible defaults are taken into account is
fnd  CVA þ DVA
Suppose that the life of the longest outstanding derivative between the bank and the
counterparty is T years. As explained in Chapter 9, the interval between time 0 and
time T is divided into N subintervals and CVA and DVA are estimated as
CVA ¼

DVA ¼

Here qi is the risk-neutral probability of the counterparty defaulting during the ith
interval, vi is the present value of the expected loss to the bank if the counterparty
defaults at the midpoint of the ith interval, q
i is the risk-neutral probability of the bank
defaulting during the ith interval, and v
i is the present value of the expected loss to the
counterparty (gain to the bank) if the bank defaults at the midpoint of the ith interval.
Consider ﬁrst the calculation of qi. Note that qi should be a risk-neutral default
probability because we are valuing future cash ﬂows and (implicitly) using risk-neutral
valuation (see Section 24.5). Suppose that ti is the end point of the ith interval, so that
qi is the risk-neutral probability of a counterparty default between times ti1 and ti. We
ﬁrst estimate credit spreads for the counterparty for a number of diﬀerent maturities.
Using interpolation, we then obtain an estimate, sðtiÞ, of the counterparty’s credit
spread for maturity ti ð1 6 i 6 NÞ. From equation (24.2), an estimate of the counter-
party’s average hazard rate between times 0 and ti is sðtiÞ=ð1  RÞ, where R is the
recovery rate expected in the event of a counterparty default. From equation (24.1), the
probability that the counterparty will not default by time ti is

is the probability of the counterparty defaulting during the ith interval. The probability
q
i is similarly calculated from the bank’s credit spreads.
Consider next the calculation of the vi assuming that no collateral is posted. This
usually requires a computationally very time consuming Monte Carlo simulation. The
market variables determining the no-default value of the outstanding transactions
between the dealer and the counterparty are simulated in a risk-neutral world between
time 0 and time T. On each simulation trial, the exposure of the bank to the counterparty
at the midpoint of each interval is calculated. The exposure is equal to maxðV; 0Þ, where
V is the total value of the transactions to the bank. (If the transactions in total have a
negative value to the bank, there is no exposure; if they have a positive value, the exposure
is equal to this positive value.) The variable vi is set equal to the present value of the
average exposure across all simulation trials multiplied by one minus the recovery rate.
The variable v
i is calculated similarly from the counterparty’s exposure to the bank.
When there is a collateral agreement between the bank and the counterparty, the
calculation of vi is more complicated. It is necessary to estimate on each simulation trial
the amount of collateral held by each side at the midpoint of the ith interval in the event
578
CHAPTER 24

of a default. In this calculation, it is usually assumed that the counterparty stops
posting collateral and stops returning any excess collateral held c days before a default.
The parameter c, which is typically 10 or 20 days, is referred to as the cure period or
margin period of risk. In order to know what collateral is held at the midpoint of an
interval in the event of a default, it is necessary to calculate the value of transactions c
days earlier. The way exposure is calculated is illustrated with the following example.
The present value of the expected loss vi is calculated from the average exposure across
all simulation trials as in the no-collateral case. A similar analysis of the average
exposure of the counterparty to the bank leads to v
i .
Example 24.4
There is a two-way zero-threshold collateral agreement between a bank and its
counterparty. This means that each side is required to post collateral worth
maxðV; 0Þ with the other side, where V is the value of the outstanding transactions
to the other side. The cure period is 20 days. Suppose that time  is the midpoint
of one of the intervals used in the bank’s CVA calculation.
1. On a particular simulation trial, the value of outstanding transactions to the
bank at time  is 50 and their value 20 days earlier is 45. In this case, the
calculation assumes that the bank has collateral worth 45 in the event of a
default at time . The bank’s exposure is the uncollateralized value it has in
the derivatives transactions, or 5.
2. On a particular simulation trial the value of outstanding transactions to the
bank at time  is 50 and their value 20 days earlier is 55. In this case, it is
assumed that the bank will have adequate collateral and its exposure is
zero.
3. On a particular simulation trial the value of outstanding transactions to the
bank at time  is 50 and the value 20 days earlier is 45. In this case, the
bank is assumed to have posted less than 50 of collateral in the event of a
default at time  and its exposure is zero.
4. On a particular simulation trial the value of outstanding transactions to the
bank at time  is 50 and the value 20 days earlier is 55. In this case, it is
assumed that 55 of collateral is held by the counterparty 20 days before time
 and, in the event of a default at time , none of it is returned. The bank’s
exposure is therefore 5, the excess collateral it has posted.
In addition to calculating CVA, banks usually calculate peak exposure at the midpoint
of each interval. This is a high percentile of the exposures given by the Monte Carlo
simulation trials. For example, if the percentile is 97.5% and there are 10,000 Monte
Carlo trials, the peak exposure at a particular midpoint is the 250th highest exposure at
that point. The maximum peak exposure is the maximum of the peak exposures at all
midpoints.12
Banks usually store all the paths sampled for all market variables and all the
valuations calculated on each path. This enables the impact of a new transaction on
CVA and DVA to be calculated relatively quickly. Only the value of the new transaction
for each sample path needs to be calculated in order to determine its incremental eﬀect
12 There is a theoretical issue here (which is usually ignored). The peak exposure is a scenario analysis
measure and should be calculated using real-world default estimates rather than risk-neutral estimates.

on CVA and DVA. If the value of the new transaction is positively correlated to existing
transactions, it is likely to increase CVA and DVA. If it is negatively correlated to
existing transactions (e.g., because it is wholly or partially unwinding those trans-
actions), it is likely to decrease CVA and DVA.
The method for calculating CVA that we have presented assumes that the probability
of default by the counterparty is independent of the bank’s exposure. This is a reason-
able assumption in many situations. Traders use the term wrong-way risk to describe the
situation where the probability of default is positively correlated with exposure and the
term right-way risk to describe the situation where the probability of default is
negatively correlated with exposure. More complicated models than those we describe
have been developed to describe dependence between default probability and exposure.
A bank has one CVA and one DVA for each of its counterparties. The CVAs and
DVAs can be regarded as derivatives which change in value as market variables change,
counterparty credit spreads change, and bank credit spreads change. Often the risks in
CVA and DVA are managed in the same way as the risks in other derivatives using
Greek letter calculations, scenario analyses, etc.
Credit Risk Mitigation
There are a number of ways banks try to reduce credit risk in bilaterally cleared trans-
actions. One, which we have already mentioned, is netting. Suppose a bank has three
uncollateralized transactions with a counterparty worth þ$10 million, þ$30 million, and
$25 million. If they are regarded as independent transactions, the bank’s exposure on
the transactions is $10 million, $30 million, and $0 for a total exposure of $40 million.
With netting, the transactions are regarded as a single transaction worth $15 million and
the exposure is reduced from $40 million to $15 million.
Collateral agreements are an important way of reducing credit risk. Collateral can be
either cash (which earns interest) or marketable securities. The market value of the
latter may be reduced by a certain percentage to calculate their cash-equivalent for
collateral purposes. The reduction is referred to as a haircut. Derivatives transactions
receive favorable treatment in the event of a default. The nondefaulting party is entitled
to keep any collateral posted by the other side. Expensive and time-consuming legal
proceedings are not usually necessary.
Another credit risk mitigation technique used by ﬁnancial institutions is known as a
downgrade trigger. This is a clause in the Master Agreement stating that if the credit
rating of the counterparty falls below a certain level, say BBB, the bank has the option to
close out all outstanding derivatives transactions at market value. Downgrade triggers do
not provide protection against a relatively big jump in a counterparty’s credit rating
(e.g., from A to default). Moreover, they work well only if relatively little use is made of
them. If a company has many downgrade triggers with its counterparties, they are likely
to provide little protection to those counterparties (see Business Snapshot 24.1).
Special Cases
In this section we consider two special cases where CVA can be calculated without
Monte Carlo simulation.
The ﬁrst special case is where the portfolio between the bank and the counterparty
consists of a single uncollateralized derivative that provides a payoﬀto the bank at
580
CHAPTER 24

time T. (The bank could for instance have bought a European option with remaining
life T from the counterparty.) The bank’s exposure at a future time is the no-default
value of the derivative at that time. The present value of the exposure is therefore the
present value of the derivative’s future value. This is the no-default value of the
derivative today. Hence
vi ¼ fndð1  RÞ
for all i, where fnd is the no-default value of the derivative today and R is the recovery
rate. This implies

Business Snapshot 24.1
Downgrade Triggers and Enron’s Bankruptcy
In December 2001, Enron, one of the largest companies in the United States, went
bankrupt. Right up to the last few days, it had an investment-grade credit rating. The
Moody’s rating immediately prior to default was Baa3 and the S&P rating was BBB.
The default was, however, anticipated to some extent by the stock market because
Enron’s stock price fell sharply in the period leading up to the bankruptcy. The
probability of default estimated by models such as the one described in Section 24.6
increased sharply during this period.
Enron had entered into a huge number of derivatives transactions with downgrade
triggers. The downgrade triggers stated that, if its credit rating fell below investment
grade (i.e., below Baa3/BBB), its counterparties would have the option of closing
out the transactions. Suppose that Enron had been downgraded to below investment
grade in, say, October 2001. The transactions that counterparties would choose to
close out would be those with negative values to Enron (and positive values to the
counterparties). So, Enron would have been required to make huge cash payments to
its counterparties. It would not have been able to do this and immediate bankruptcy
would have resulted.
This example illustrates that downgrade triggers provide protection only when
relatively little use is made of them. When a company enters into a large number of
contracts with downgrade triggers, they may actually cause a company to go bank-
rupt prematurely. In Enron’s case, we could argue that it was going to go bankrupt
anyway and accelerating the event by two months would not have done any harm. In
fact, Enron did have a chance of survival in October 2001. Attempts were being made
to work out a deal with another energy company, Dynergy, and so forcing bank-
ruptcy in October 2001 was not in the interests of either creditors or shareholders.
The credit rating companies found themselves in a diﬃcult position. If they
downgraded Enron to recognize its deteriorating ﬁnancial position, they were signing
its death warrant. If they did not do so, there was a chance of Enron surviving.

One particular derivative of the type we are considering is a T-year zero-coupon bond

This shows that the derivative can be valued by increasing the discount rate that is
applied to the expected payoﬀin a risk-neutral world by the counterparty’s T-year
credit spread.
Example 24.5
The Black–Scholes–Merton price of a 2-year uncollateralized option is $3. Two-
year zero-coupon bonds issued by the company selling the option have a yield
1.5% greater than the risk-free rate. The value of the option after default risk is
considered is 3e0:0152 ¼ $2:91. (This assumes that the option stands alone and
is not netted with other derivatives in the event of default.)
For the second special case, we consider a bank that has entered into an uncollateral-
ized forward transaction with a counterparty where it has agreed to buy an asset for
price K at time T. Deﬁne Ft as the forward price at time t for delivery of the asset at
time T. The value of the transaction at time t is, from Section 5.7,

The expected value of Ft in a risk-neutral world is F0. The standard deviation of ln Ft is

Example 24.6
A bank has entered into a forward contract to buy 1 million ounces of gold from a
mining company in 2 years for $1,500 per ounce. The current 2-year forward price
is $1,600 per ounce. We suppose that only two intervals each 1-year long are
considered in the calculation of CVA. The probability of the company defaulting
during the ﬁrst year is 2% and the probability that it will default during the
second year is 3%. The risk-free rate is 5% per annum. A 30% recovery in the
event of default is anticipated. The volatility of the forward price of gold is 20%.
In this case, q1 ¼ 0:02, q2 ¼ 0:03, F0 ¼ 1,600, K ¼ 1,500,  ¼ 0:2, r ¼ 0:05,

company can default to be more frequent (see Problem 24.29). DVA, which
increases the value of the derivative, can be calculated in a similar way to CVA
(see Problem 24.30).
24.8
DEFAULT CORRELATION
The term default correlation is used to describe the tendency for two companies to
default at about the same time. There are a number of reasons why default correlation
exists. Companies in the same industry or the same geographic region tend to be
aﬀected similarly by external events and as a result may experience ﬁnancial diﬃculties
at the same time. Economic conditions generally cause average default rates to be
higher in some years than in other years. A default by one company may cause a default
by another—the credit contagion eﬀect. Default correlation means that credit risk
cannot be completely diversiﬁed away and is the major reason why risk-neutral default
probabilities are greater than real-world default probabilities (see Section 24.5).
Default correlation is important in the determination of probability distributions for
default losses from a portfolio of exposures to diﬀerent counterparties.13 Two types of
13 A binomial correlation measure that has been used by rating agencies is described in Technical Note 26 at
www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes.

default correlation models that have been suggested by researchers are referred to as
reduced form models and structural models.
Reduced form models assume that the hazard rates for diﬀerent companies follow
stochastic processes and are correlated with macroeconomic variables. When the hazard
rate for company A is high there is a tendency for the hazard rate for company B to be
high. This induces a default correlation between the two companies.
Reduced form models are mathematically attractive and reﬂect the tendency for
economic cycles to generate default correlations. Their main disadvantage is that the
range of default correlations that can be achieved is limited. Even when there is a perfect
correlation between the hazard rates of the two companies, the probability that they will
both default during the same short period of time is usually very low. This is liable to be a
problem in some circumstances. For example, when two companies operate in the same
industry and the same country or when the ﬁnancial health of one company is for some
reason heavily dependent on the ﬁnancial health of another company, a relatively high
default correlation may be warranted. One approach to solving this problem is by
extending the model so that the hazard rate exhibits large jumps.
Structural models are based on a model similar to Merton’s model (see Section 24.6).
A company defaults if the value of its assets is below a certain level. Default correlation
between companies A and B is introduced into the model by assuming that the
stochastic process followed by the assets of company A is correlated with the stochastic
process followed by the assets of company B. Structural models have the advantage
over reduced form models that the correlation can be made as high as desired. Their
main disadvantage is that they are liable to be computationally quite slow.
The Gaussian Copula Model for Time to Default
A model that has become a popular practical tool is the Gaussian copula model for the
time to default. It can be shown to be similar to Merton’s structural model. It assumes that
all companies will default eventually and attempts to quantify the correlation between the
probability distributions of the times to default for two or more diﬀerent companies.
The model can be used in conjunction with either real-world or risk-neutral default
probabilities. The left tail of the real-world probability distribution for the time to
default of a company can be estimated from data produced by rating agencies such as
that in Table 24.1. The left tail of the risk-neutral probability distribution of the time to
default can be estimated from bond prices using the approach in Section 24.4.
Deﬁne t1 as the time to default of company 1 and t2 as the time to default of
company 2. If the probability distributions of t1 and t2 were normal, we could assume
that the joint probability distribution of t1 and t2 is bivariate normal. As it happens, the
probability distribution of a company’s time to default is not even approximately
normal. This is where a Gaussian copula model comes in. We transform t1 and t2 into
new variables x1 and x2 using
x1 ¼ N1½Q1ðt1Þ;
x2 ¼ N1½Q2ðt2Þ
where Q1 and Q2 are the cumulative probability distributions for t1 and t2, and N1 is the
inverse of the cumulative normal distribution (u ¼ N1ðvÞ when v ¼ NðuÞ). These are
‘‘percentile-to-percentile’’ transformations. The 5-percentile point in the probability
distribution for t1 is transformed to x1 ¼ 1:645, which is the 5-percentile point in the
standard normal distribution; the 10-percentile point in the probability distribution for t1
584
CHAPTER 24

is transformed to x1 ¼ 1:282, which is the 10-percentile point in the standard normal
distribution; and so on. The t2-to-x2 transformation is similar.
By construction, x1 and x2 have normal distributions with mean zero and unit
standard deviation. The model assumes that the joint distribution of x1 and x2 is
bivariate normal. This assumption is referred to as using a Gaussian copula. The
assumption is convenient because it means that the joint probability distribution of
t1 and t2 is fully deﬁned by the cumulative default probability distributions Q1 and Q2
for t1 and t2, together with a single correlation parameter.
The attraction of the Gaussian copula model is that it can be extended to many
companies. Suppose that we are considering n companies and that ti is the time to default
of the ith company. We transform each ti into a new variable, xi, that has a standard
normal distribution. The transformation is the percentile-to-percentile transformation
xi ¼ N1½QiðtiÞ
where Qi is the cumulative probability distribution for ti. It is then assumed that the xi
are multivariate normal. The default correlation between ti and tj is measured as the
correlation between xi and xj. This is referred to as the copula correlation.14
The Gaussian copula is a useful way of representing the correlation structure
between variables that are not normally distributed. It allows the correlation structure
of the variables to be estimated separately from their marginal (unconditional)
distributions. Although the variables themselves are not multivariate normal, the
approach assumes that after a transformation is applied to each variable they are
multivariate normal.
Example 24.6
Suppose that we wish to simulate defaults during the next 5 years in 10 com-
panies. The copula default correlations between each pair of companies is 0.2. For
each company the cumulative probability of a default during the next 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 years is 1%, 3%, 6%, 10%, 15%, respectively. When a Gaussian copula is used
we sample from a multivariate normal distribution to obtain the xi ð1 6 i 6 10Þ
with the pairwise correlation between the xi being 0.2. We then convert the xi
to ti, a time to default. When the sample from the normal distribution is less than
N1ð0:01Þ ¼ 2:33, a default takes place within the ﬁrst year; when the sample is
between 2:33 and N1ð0:03Þ ¼ 1:88, a default takes place during the second
year; when the sample is between –1.88 and N1ð0:06Þ ¼ 1:55, a default takes
place during the third year; when the sample is between 1:55 and N1ð0:10Þ ¼
1:28, a default takes place during the fourth year; when the sample is between
1:28 and N1ð0:15Þ ¼ 1:04, a default takes place during the ﬁfth year. When
the sample is greater than 1:04, there is no default during the 5 years.
A Factor-Based Correlation Structure
To avoid deﬁning a diﬀerent correlation between xi and xj for each pair of companies i
and j in the Gaussian copula model, a one-factor model is often used. The assumption
14 As an approximation, the copula correlation between ti and tj is often assumed to be the correlation
between the equity returns for companies i and j.

In this equation, F is a common factor aﬀecting defaults for all companies and Zi is a

standard normal distributions. The ai are constant parameters between 1 and þ1. The
correlation between xi and xj is ai aj.15
Suppose that the probability that company i will default by a particular time T
is QiðTÞ. Under the Gaussian copula model, a default happens by time T when

CREDIT VaR
Credit value at risk can be deﬁned analogously to the way value at risk is deﬁned for
market risks (see Chapter 22). For example, a credit VaR with a conﬁdence level of
99.9% and a 1-year time horizon is the credit loss that we are 99.9% conﬁdent will not
be exceeded over 1 year.
Consider a bank with a very large portfolio of similar loans. As an approximation,
assume that the probability of default is the same for each loan and the correlation
between each pair of loans is the same. When the Gaussian copula model for time to
default is used, the right-hand side of equation (24.9) is to a good approximation
equal to the percentage of defaults by time T as a function of F. The factor F has a
standard normal distribution. We are X% certain that its value will be greater than

This result was ﬁrst produced by Vasicek.16 As in equation (24.9), QðTÞ is the probability

R is the recovery rate. The contribution of a particular loan of size Li to the credit VaR

credit risk capital.17

of credit losses by carrying out a Monte Carlo simulation of the credit rating changes of
all counterparties. Suppose we are interested in determining the probability distribution
of losses over a 1-year period. On each simulation trial, we sample to determine the credit
rating changes and defaults of all counterparties during the year. We then revalue our
outstanding contracts to determine the total of credit losses for the year. After a large
number of simulation trials, a probability distribution for credit losses is obtained. This
can be used to calculate credit VaR.
This approach is liable to be computationally quite time intensive. However, it has
the advantage that credit losses are deﬁned as those arising from credit downgrades as
well as defaults. Also the impact of credit mitigation clauses such as those described in
Section 24.7 can be approximately incorporated into the analysis.
Table 24.5 is typical of the historical data provided by rating agencies on credit
rating changes and could be used as a basis for a CreditMetrics Monte Carlo
simulation. It shows the percentage probability of a bond moving from one rating

were published in Risk magazine in December 2002 under the title ‘‘Loan Portfolio Value’’.

category to another during a 1-year period. For example, a bond that starts with an A
credit rating has a 90.91% chance of still having an A rating at the end of 1 year. It
has a 0.05% chance of defaulting during the year, a 0.09% chance of dropping to B,
and so on.18
In sampling to determine credit losses, the credit rating changes for diﬀerent counter-
parties should not be assumed to be independent. A Gaussian copula model is typically
used to construct a joint probability distribution of rating changes similarly to the way
it is used in the model in the previous section to describe the joint probability
distribution of times to default. The copula correlation between the rating transitions
for two companies is usually set equal to the correlation between their equity returns
using a factor model similar to that in Section 24.8.
As an illustration of the CreditMetrics approach suppose that we are simulating the
rating change of a Aaa and a Baa company over a 1-year period using the transition
matrix in Table 24.5. Suppose that the correlation between the equities of the two
companies is 0.2. On each simulation trial, we would sample two variables xA and xB
from normal distributions so that their correlation is 0.2. The variable xA determines
the new rating of the Aaa company and variable xB determines the new rating
of the Baa company. Since N1ð0:9059Þ ¼ 1:3159, the Aaa company stays Aaa if
xA < 1:3159; since N1ð0:9059 þ 0:0831Þ ¼ 2:2904, it becomes Aa if 1:3159 6 xA <
2:2904; since N1ð0:9059 þ 0:0831 þ 0:0089Þ ¼ 2:8627, it becomes A if 2:2904 6 xA <
2:8627; and so on. Consider next the Baa company. Since N1ð0:0004Þ ¼ 3:3528, the
Baa company becomes Aaa if xB < 3:3528; since N1ð0:0004 þ 0:0030Þ ¼ 2:7065, it
becomes Aa if 3:3528 6 xB < 2:7065; since
N1ð0:0004 þ 0:0030 þ 0:0458Þ ¼ 1:6527
it becomes A if 2:7065 6 xB < 1:6527; and so on. The Aaa never defaults during the
year. The Baa defaults when xB > N1ð0:9970Þ, that is when xB > 2:7478.

CHAPTER 24

SUMMARY
The probability that a company will default during a particular period of time in the
future can be estimated from historical data, bond prices, or equity prices. The default
probabilities calculated from bond prices are risk-neutral probabilities, whereas those
calculated from historical data are real-world probabilities. Real-world probabilities
should be used for scenario analysis and the calculation of credit VaR. Risk-neutral
probabilities should be used for valuing credit-sensitive instruments. Risk-neutral
default probabilities are often signiﬁcantly higher than real-world default probabilities.
The credit value adjustment (CVA) is the amount by which a bank reduces the value
of a derivatives portfolio with a counterparty because of the possibility of the counter-
party defaulting. The debt (or debit) value adjustment is the amount by which it
increases the value of a portfolio because it might itself default. The calculation of
CVA and DVA involves a time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation to determine the
expected future exposures of the two sides of the portfolio.
Credit VaR can be deﬁned similarly to the way VaR is deﬁned for market risk. One
approach to calculating it is the Gaussian copula model of time to default. This is used
by regulators in the calculation of capital for credit risk. Another popular approach for
calculating credit VaR is CreditMetrics. This uses a Gaussian copula model for credit
rating changes.

CHAPTER 24

Credit Derivatives
An important development in derivatives markets since the late 1990s has been the
growth of credit derivatives. In 2000, the total notional principal for outstanding
credit derivatives contracts was about $800 billion. By the credit crisis of 2007, this
had become $50 trillion. After the crisis, the size of the market declined. The total
notional principal was about $25 trillion in December 2012. Credit derivatives are
contracts where the payoﬀdepends on the creditworthiness of one or more companies
or countries. This chapter explains how credit derivatives work and how they are
valued.
Credit derivatives allow companies to trade credit risks in much the same way that
they trade market risks. Banks and other ﬁnancial institutions used to be in the position
where they could do little once they had assumed a credit risk except wait (and hope for
the best). Now they can actively manage their portfolios of credit risks, keeping some
and entering into credit derivative contracts to protect themselves from others. Banks
have historically been the biggest buyers of credit protection and insurance companies
have been the biggest sellers.
Credit derivatives can be categorized as ‘‘single-name’’ or ‘‘multi-name.’’ The most
popular single-name credit derivative is a credit default swap. The payoﬀfrom this
instrument depends on the creditworthiness of one company or country. There are two
sides to the contract: the buyer and seller of protection. There is a payoﬀfrom the seller
of protection to the buyer of protection if the speciﬁed entity (company or country)
defaults on its obligations. A popular multi-name credit derivative is a collateralized
debt obligation. In this, a portfolio of debt instruments is speciﬁed and a complex
structure is created where the cash ﬂows from the portfolio are channelled to diﬀerent
categories of investors. Chapter 8 describes how multi-name credit derivatives were
created from residential mortgages during the period leading up to the credit crisis. This
chapter focuses on the situation where the underlying credit risks are those of corpora-
tions or countries.
This chapter starts by explaining how credit default swaps work and how they are
valued. It then explains credit indices and the way in which traders can use them to buy
protection on a portfolio. After that it moves on to cover basket credit default swaps,
asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. It expands on the material
in Chapter 24 to show how the Gaussian copula model of default correlation can be
used to value tranches of collateralized debt obligations.

25.1
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
The most popular credit derivative is a credit default swap (CDS). This was introduced
in Section 7.12. It is a contract that provides insurance against the risk of a default by
particular company. The company is known as the reference entity and a default by the
company is known as a credit event. The buyer of the insurance obtains the right to sell
bonds issued by the company for their face value when a credit event occurs and the
seller of the insurance agrees to buy the bonds for their face value when a credit event
occurs.1 The total face value of the bonds that can be sold is known as the credit default
swap’s notional principal.
The buyer of the CDS makes periodic payments to the seller until the end of the life
of the CDS or until a credit event occurs. These payments are typically made in arrears
every quarter, but deals where payments are made every month, 6 months, or 12 months
also occur and sometimes payments are made in advance. The settlement in the event of
a default involves either physical delivery of the bonds or a cash payment.
An example will help to illustrate how a typical deal is structured. Suppose that two
parties enter into a 5-year credit default swap on March 20, 2015. Assume that the
notional principal is $100 million and the buyer agrees to pay 90 basis points per annum
for protection against default by the reference entity, with payments being made
quarterly in arrears.
The CDS is shown in Figure 25.1. If the reference entity does not default (i.e., there is
no credit event), the buyer receives no payoﬀand pays 22.5 basis points (a quarter of
90 basis points) on $100 million on June 20, 2015, and every quarter thereafter until
March 20, 2020. The amount paid each quarter is 0:00225  100,000,000, or $225,000.2
If there is a credit event, a substantial payoﬀis likely. Suppose that the buyer notiﬁes the
seller of a credit event on May 20, 2018 (2 months into the fourth year). If the contract
Business Snapshot 25.1
Who Bears the Credit Risk?
Traditionally banks have been in the business of making loans and then bearing the
credit risk that the borrower will default. However, banks have for some time been
reluctant to keep loans on their balance sheets. This is because, after the capital
required by regulators has been accounted for, the average return earned on loans is
often less attractive than that on other assets. As discussed in Section 8.1, banks
created asset-backed securities to pass loans (and their credit risk) on to investors. In
the late 1990s and early 2000s, banks also made extensive use of credit derivatives to
shift the credit risk in their loans to other parts of the ﬁnancial system.
The result of all this is that the ﬁnancial institution bearing the credit risk of a loan
is often diﬀerent from the ﬁnancial institution that did the original credit checks. As
the credit crisis starting in 2007 has shown, this is not always good for the overall
health of the ﬁnancial system.
1 The face value (or par value) of a coupon-bearing bond is the principal amount that the issuer repays at
maturity if it does not default.
2 The quarterly payments are liable to be slightly diﬀerent from $225,000 because of the application of the
day count conventions described in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 25

speciﬁes physical settlement, the buyer has the right to sell bonds issued by the reference
entity with a face value of $100 million for $100 million. If, as is now usual, there is cash
settlement, an ISDA-organized auction process is used to determine the mid-market
value of the cheapest deliverable bond several days after the credit event. Suppose the
auction indicates that the bond is worth $35 per $100 of face value. The cash payoﬀ
would be $65 million.
The regular quarterly, semiannual, or annual payments from the buyer of protection
to the seller of protection cease when there is a credit event. However, because these
payments are made in arrears, a ﬁnal accrual payment by the buyer is usually required.
In our example, where there is a default on May 20, 2018, the buyer would be required
to pay to the seller the amount of the annual payment accrued between March 20, 2018,
and May 20, 2018 (approximately $150,000), but no further payments would be
required.
The total amount paid per year, as a percent of the notional principal, to buy
protection (90 basis points in our example) is known as the CDS spread. Several large
banks are market makers in the credit default swap market. When quoting on a new
5-year credit default swap on a company, a market maker might bid 250 basis points
and oﬀer 260 basis points. This means that the market maker is prepared to buy
protection by paying 250 basis points per year (i.e., 2.5% of the principal per year) and
to sell protection for 260 basis points per year (i.e., 2.6% of the principal per year).
Many diﬀerent companies and countries are reference entities for the CDS contracts
that trade. As mentioned, payments are usually made quarterly in arrears. Contracts
with maturities of 5 years are most popular, but other maturities such as 1, 2, 3, 7, and
10 years are not uncommon. Usually contracts mature on one of the following standard
dates: March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. The eﬀect of this is that the
actual time to maturity of a contract when it is initiated is close to, but not necessarily
the same as, the number of years to maturity that is speciﬁed. Suppose you call a dealer
on November 15, 2015, to buy 5-year protection on a company. The contract would
probably last until December 20, 2020. Your ﬁrst payment would be due on Decem-
ber 20, 2015, and would equal an amount covering the November 15, 2015, to
December 20, 2015, period.3 A key aspect of a CDS contract is the deﬁnition of a
credit event (i.e., a default). Usually a credit event is deﬁned as a failure to make a
payment as it becomes due, a restructuring of debt, or a bankruptcy. Restructuring is
sometimes excluded in North American contracts, particularly in situations where the
yield on the company’s debt is high. More information on the CDS market is given in
Business Snapshot 25.2.

Business Snapshot 25.2
The CDS Market
In 1998 and 1999, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)
developed a standard contract for trading credit default swaps in the over-the-
counter market. Since then the market has grown in popularity. A CDS contract is
like an insurance contract in many ways, but there is one key diﬀerence. An insurance
contract provides protection against losses on an asset that is owned by the protec-
tion buyer. In the case of a CDS, the underlying asset does not have to be owned.
During the credit turmoil that started in August 2007, regulators became very
concerned about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). They felt that credit default
swaps were a source of vulnerability for ﬁnancial markets. The danger is that a default
by one ﬁnancial institution might lead to big losses by its counterparties in CDS
transactions and further defaults by other ﬁnancial institutions. Regulatory concerns
were fueled by troubles at insurance giant AIG. This was a big seller of protection on
the AAA-rated tranches created from mortgages (see Chapter 8). The protection
proved very costly to AIG and the company was bailed out by the U.S. government.
During 2007 and 2008, trading ceased in many types of credit derivatives, but CDSs
continued to trade actively (although the cost of protection increased dramatically).
The advantage of CDSs over some other credit derivatives is that the way they work is
straightforward. Other credit derivatives, such as those created from the securitization
of household mortgages (see Chapter 8), lack this transparency.
It is not uncommon for the volume of CDSs on a company to be greater than its
debt. Cash settlement of contracts is then clearly necessary. When Lehman defaulted
in September 2008, there was about $400 billion of CDS contracts and $155 billion of
Lehman debt outstanding. The cash payout to the buyers of protection (determined by
an ISDA auction process) was 91.375% of principal.
There is one important diﬀerence between credit default swaps and the other over-
the-counter derivatives that we have considered in this book. The other over-the-
counter derivatives depend on interest rates, exchange rates, equity indices, commodity
prices, and so on. There is no reason to assume that any one market participant has
better information than any other market participant about these variables.
Credit default swaps spreads depend on the probability that a particular company
will default during a particular period of time. Arguably some market participants
have more information to estimate this probability than others. A ﬁnancial institu-
tion that works closely with a particular company by providing advice, making
loans, and handling new issues of securities is likely to have more information about
the creditworthiness of the company than another ﬁnancial institution that has no
dealings with the company. Economists refer to this as an asymmetric information
problem. Financial institutions emphasize that the decision to buy protection against
the risk of default by a company is normally made by a risk manager and is not
based on any special information that may exist elsewhere in the ﬁnancial institution
about the company.

CHAPTER 25

time enters into a 5-year CDS to buy protection against the issuer of the bond
defaulting. Suppose that the CDS spread is 200 basis points, or 2%, per annum. The
eﬀect of the CDS is to convert the corporate bond to a risk-free bond (at least
approximately). If the bond issuer does not default, the investor earns 5% per year
when the CDS spread is netted against the corporate bond yield. If the bond does
default, the investor earns 5% up to the time of the default. Under the terms of the
CDS, the investor is then able to exchange the bond for its face value. This face value
can be invested at the risk-free rate for the remainder of the 5 years.
This shows that the spread of the yield on an n-year bond issued by a company over the
risk-free rate should approximately equal the company’s n-year CDS spread. If it is
markedly more than this, an investor can earn more than the risk-free rate by buying the
corporate bond and buying protection. If it is markedly less than this, an investor can
borrow at less than the risk-free rate by shorting the bond and selling CDS protection.
The CDS–bond basis is deﬁned as
CDS–bond basis ¼ CDS spread  Bond yield spread
The bond yield spread is calculated using the LIBOR/swap rate as the risk-free rate.
Usually the bond yield spread is set equal to the asset swap spread.
The arbitrage argument given above suggests that the CDS–bond basis should be
close to zero. In fact it tends to be positive during some periods (e.g., pre-2007) and
negative during other periods (e.g., 2007–2009). The sign of the CDS–bond basis at any
given time can depend on the underlying reference entity.
The Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond
As explained in Section 24.3, the recovery rate on a bond is deﬁned as the value of the
bond immediately after default as a percent of face value. This means that the payoﬀ
from a CDS is Lð1  RÞ, where L is the notional principal and R is the recovery rate.
Usually a CDS speciﬁes that a number of diﬀerent bonds can be delivered in the event
of a default. The bonds typically have the same seniority, but they may not sell for the
same percentage of face value immediately after a default.4 This gives the holder of a CDS
a cheapest-to-deliver bond option. As already mentioned, an auction process, organized
by ISDA, is usually used to determine the value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and,
therefore, the payoﬀto the buyer of protection.
25.2
VALUATION OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
The CDS spread for a particular reference entity can be calculated from default
probability estimates. We will illustrate how this is done for a 5-year CDS.
Suppose that the hazard rate of the reference entity is 2% per annum for the whole of
the 5-year life of the CDS. Table 25.1 shows survival probabilities and unconditional
probabilities of default. From equation (24.1), the probability of survival to time t
4 There are a number of reasons for this. The claim that is made in the event of a default is typically equal to
the bond’s face value plus accrued interest. Bonds with high accrued interest at the time of default therefore
tend to have higher prices immediately after default. Also the market may judge that in the event of a
reorganization of the company some bond holders will fare better than others.

is e0:02t. The probability of default during a year is the probability of survival to the
beginning of the year minus the probability of survival to the end of the year. For
example, the probability of survival to time 2 years is e0:022 ¼ 0:9608 and the
probability of survival to time 3 years is e0:023 ¼ 0:9418. The probability of default
during the third year is 0:9608  0:9418 ¼ 0:0190.
We will assume that defaults always happen halfway through a year and that payments
on the credit default swap are made once a year, at the end of each year. We also assume
that the risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum with continuous compounding and the
recovery rate is 40%. There are three parts to the calculation. These are shown in
Tables 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4.
Table 25.2 shows the calculation of the present value of the expected payments made
on the CDS assuming that payments are made at the rate of s per year and the notional
principal is $1. For example, there is a 0.9418 probability that the third payment of s is
made.

Table 25.3 shows the calculation of the present value of the expected payoﬀassuming
a notional principal of $1. As mentioned earlier, we are assuming that defaults always
happen halfway through a year. For example, there is a 0.0190 probability of a payoﬀ
halfway through the third year. Given that the recovery rate is 40%, the expected payoﬀ
at this time is 0:0190  0:6  1 ¼ 0:0114. The present value of the expected payoﬀis

CHAPTER 25

As a ﬁnal step, Table 25.4 considers the accrual payment made in the event of a default.
For example, there is a 0.0190 probability that there will be a ﬁnal accrual payment
halfway through the third year. The accrual payment is 0:5s. The expected accrual
payment at this time is therefore 0:0190  0:5s ¼ 0:0095s. Its present value is
0:0095se0:052:5 ¼ 0:0084s. The total present value of the expected accrual payments
is 0:0422s.
From Tables 25.2 and 25.4, the present value of the expected payments is
4:0728s þ 0:0422s ¼ 4:1150s
From Table 25.3, the present value of the expected payoﬀis 0.0506. Equating the two
gives
4:1150s ¼ 0:0506
or s ¼ 0:0123. The mid-market CDS spread for the 5-year deal we have considered
should be 0.0123 times the principal or 123 basis points per year. This result can also be
produced using the DerivaGem CDS worksheet.
The calculations assume that defaults happen only at points midway between
payment dates. This simple assumption usually gives good results, but can easily be
relaxed so that more default times are considered.

Marking to Market a CDS
A CDS, like most other swaps, is marked to market daily. It may have a positive or
negative value. Suppose, for example the credit default swap in our example had been
negotiated some time ago for a spread of 150 basis points, the present value of the
payments by the buyer would be 4:1150  0:0150 ¼ 0:0617 and the present value of the
payoﬀwould be 0.0506 as above. The value of swap to the seller would therefore be
0:0617  0:0506, or 0.0111 times the principal. Similarly the mark-to-market value of
the swap to the buyer of protection would be 0:0111 times the principal.
Estimating Default Probabilities
The default probabilities used to value a CDS should be risk-neutral default prob-
abilities, not real-world default probabilities (see Section 24.5 for a discussion of the
diﬀerence between the two). Risk-neutral default probabilities can be estimated from
bond prices or asset swaps as explained in Chapter 24. An alternative is to imply them
from CDS quotes. The latter approach is similar to the practice in options markets of
implying volatilities from the prices of actively traded options and using them to value
other options.
Suppose we change the example in Tables 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 so that we do not know
the default probabilities. Instead we know that the mid-market CDS spread for a newly
issued 5-year CDS is 100 basis points per year. We can reverse-engineer our calculations
(using Excel in conjunction with Solver) to conclude that the implied hazard rate is
1.63% per year. DerivaGem can be used to calculate a term structure of hazard rates
from a term structure of credit spreads.
Binary Credit Default Swaps
A binary credit default swap is structured similarly to a regular credit default swap
except that the payoﬀis a ﬁxed dollar amount. Suppose that, in the example we
considered in Tables 25.1 to 25.4, the payoﬀis $1 instead of 1  R dollars and the
swap spread is s. Tables 25.1, 25.2 and 25.4 are the same, but Table 25.3 is replaced by
Table 25.5. The CDS spread for a new binary CDS is given by 4:1150s ¼ 0:0844, so that
the CDS spread s is 0.0205, or 205 basis points.

CHAPTER 25

How Important Is the Recovery Rate?
Whether we use CDS spreads or bond prices to estimate default probabilities we need
an estimate of the recovery rate. However, provided that we use the same recovery rate
for (a) estimating risk-neutral default probabilities and (b) valuing a CDS, the value of
the CDS (or the estimate of the CDS spread) is not very sensitive to the recovery rate.
This is because the implied probabilities of default are approximately proportional to
1=ð1  RÞ and the payoﬀs from a CDS are proportional to 1  R.
This argument does not apply to the valuation of binary CDS. Implied probabilities of
default are still approximately proportional to 1=ð1  RÞ. However, for a binary CDS, the
payoﬀs from the CDS are independent of R. If we have a CDS spread for both a plain
vanilla CDS and a binary CDS, we can estimate both the recovery rate and the default
probability (see Problem 25.25).
25.3
CREDIT INDICES
Participants in credit markets have developed indices to track credit default swap spreads.
In 2004 there were agreements between diﬀerent producers of indices that led to some
consolidation. Two important standard portfolios used by index providers are:
1. CDX NA IG, a portfolio of 125 investment grade companies in North America
2. iTraxx Europe, a portfolio of 125 investment grade names in Europe
These portfolios are updated on March 20 and September 20 each year. Companies that
are no longer investment grade are dropped from the portfolios and new investment
grade companies are added.5
Suppose that the 5-year CDX NA IG index is quoted by a market maker as bid
65 basis points, oﬀer 66 basis points. (This is referred to as the index spread.) Roughly
speaking, this means that a trader can buy CDS protection on all 125 companies in the
index for 66 basis points per company. Suppose a trader wants $800,000 of protection
on each company. The total cost is 0:0066  800,000  125, or $660,000 per year. The
trader can similarly sell $800,000 of protection on each of the 125 companies for a total
of $650,000 per annum. When a company defaults, the protection buyer receives the
usual CDS payoﬀand the annual payment is reduced by 660,000=125 ¼ $5,280. There is
an active market in buying and selling CDS index protection for maturities of 3, 5, 7,
and 10 years. The maturities for these types of contracts on the index are usually
December 20 and June 20. (This means that a ‘‘5-year’’ contract actually lasts between
4 3
4 and 5 1
4 years.) Roughly speaking, the index is the average of the CDS spreads on the
companies in the underlying portfolio.6
5 On September 20, 2013, the Series 20 iTraxx Europe portfolio and the Series 21 CDX NA IG portfolio were
deﬁned. The series numbers indicate that, by the end of September 2013, the iTraxx Europe portfolio had
been updated 19 times and the CDX NA IG portfolio had been updated 20 times.
6 More precisely, the index is slightly lower than the average of the credit default swap spreads for the
companies in the portfolio. To understand the reason for this consider a portfolio consisting of two companies,
one with a spread of 1,000 basis points and the other with a spread of 10 basis points. To buy protection on the
companies would cost slightly less than 505 basis points per company. This is because the 1,000 basis points is
not expected to be paid for as long as the 10 basis points and should therefore carry less weight. Another
complication for CDX NA IG, but not iTraxx Europe, is that the deﬁnition of default applicable to the index
includes restructuring, whereas the deﬁnition for CDS contracts on the underlying companies may not.

25.4
THE USE OF FIXED COUPONS
The precise way in which CDS and CDS index transactions work is a little more
complicated than has been described up to now. For each underlying and each
maturity, a coupon and a recovery rate are speciﬁed. A price is calculated from the
quoted spread using the following procedure:
1. Assume four payments per year, made in arrears.
2. Imply a hazard rate from the quoted spread. This involves calculations similar to
those in Section 25.2. An iterative search is used to determine the hazard rate that
leads to the quoted spread.
3. Calculate a ‘‘duration’’ D for the CDS payments. This is the number that the
spread is multiplied by to get the present value of the spread payments. (In the
example in Section 25.2, it is 4.1130.)7
4. The price P is given by P ¼ 100  100  D  ðs  cÞ, where s is the spread and c is
the coupon expressed in decimal form.
When a trader buys protection the trader pays 100  P per $100 of the total remaining
notional and the seller of protection receives this amount. (If 100  P is negative, the
buyer of protection receives money and the seller of protection pays money.) The buyer of
protection then pays the coupon times the remaining notional on each payment date. (On
a CDS, the remaining notional is the original notional until default and zero thereafter.
For a CDS index, the remaining notional is the number of names in the index that have
not yet defaulted multiplied by the principal per name.) The payoﬀwhen there is a
default is calculated in the usual way. This arrangement facilitates trading because the
instruments trade like bonds. The regular quarterly payments made by the buyer of
protection are independent of the spread at the time the buyer enters into the contract.
Example 25.1
Suppose that the iTraxx Europe index quote is 34 basis points and the coupon is
40 basis points for a contract lasting exactly 5 years, with both quotes being
expressed using an actual/360 day count. (This is the usual day count convention
in CDS and CDS index markets.) The equivalent actual/actual quotes are 0.345%
for the index and 0.406% for the coupon. Suppose that the yield curve is ﬂat at
4% per year (actual/actual, continuously compounded). The speciﬁed recovery
rate is 40%. With four payments per year in arrears, the implied hazard rate is
0.5717%. The duration is 4.447 years. The price is therefore
100  100  4:447  ð0:00345  0:00406Þ ¼ 100:27
Consider a contract where protection is $1 million per name. Initially, the seller of
protection would pay the buyer $1,000,000  125  0:0027. Thereafter, the buyer
of protection would make quarterly payments in arrears at an annual rate of
$1,000,000  0:00406  n, where n is the number of companies that have not
defaulted. When a company defaults, the payoﬀis calculated in the usual way
and there is an accrual payment from the buyer to the seller calculated at the rate
of 0.406% per year on $1 million.
7 This use of the term ‘‘duration’’ is diﬀerent from that in Chapter 4.
602
CHAPTER 25

25.5
CDS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS
Once the CDS market was well established, it was natural for derivatives dealers to
trade forwards and options on credit default swap spreads.8
A forward credit default swap is the obligation to buy or sell a particular credit
default swap on a particular reference entity at a particular future time T. If the
reference entity defaults before time T, the forward contract ceases to exist. Thus a
bank could enter into a forward contract to sell 5-year protection on a company for
280 basis points starting in 1 year. If the company defaulted before the 1-year point, the
forward contract would cease to exist.
A credit default swap option is an option to buy or sell a particular credit default
swap on a particular reference entity at a particular future time T. For example, a trader
could negotiate the right to buy 5-year protection on a company starting in 1 year for
280 basis points. This is a call option. If the 5-year CDS spread for the company in
1 year turns out to be more than 280 basis points, the option will be exercised;
otherwise it will not be exercised. The cost of the option would be paid up front.
Similarly an investor might negotiate the right to sell 5-year protection on a company
for 280 basis points starting in 1 year. This is a put option. If the 5-year CDS spread for
the company in 1 year turns out to be less than 280 basis points, the option will be
exercised; otherwise it will not be exercised. Again the cost of the option would be paid
up front. Like CDS forwards, CDS options are usually structured so that they cease to
exist if the reference entity defaults before option maturity.
25.6
BASKET CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
In what is referred to as a basket credit default swap there are a number of reference
entities. An add-up basket CDS provides a payoﬀwhen any of the reference entities
default. A ﬁrst-to-default CDS provides a payoﬀonly when the ﬁrst default occurs. A
second-to-default CDS provides a payoﬀonly when the second default occurs. More
generally, a kth-to-default CDS provides a payoﬀonly when the kth default occurs.
Payoﬀs are calculated in the same way as for a regular CDS. After the relevant default
has occurred, there is a settlement. The swap then terminates and there are no further
payments by either party.
25.7
TOTAL RETURN SWAPS
A total return swap is a type of credit derivative. It is an agreement to exchange the
total return on a bond (or any portfolio of assets) for LIBOR plus a spread. The total
return includes coupons, interest, and the gain or loss on the asset over the life of the
swap.
An example of a total return swap is a 5-year agreement with a notional principal of
$100 million to exchange the total return on a corporate bond for LIBOR plus 25 basis
points. This is illustrated in Figure 25.2. On coupon payment dates the payer pays the

Default Swap Options,’’ Journal of Derivatives, 10, 5 (Spring 2003): 40–50.

coupons earned on an investment of $100 million in the bond. The receiver pays interest
at a rate of LIBOR plus 25 basis points on a principal of $100 million. (LIBOR is set on
one coupon date and paid on the next as in a plain vanilla interest rate swap.) At the
end of the life of the swap there is a payment reﬂecting the change in value of the bond.
For example, if the bond increases in value by 10% over the life of the swap, the payer
is required to pay $10 million (¼ 10% of $100 million) at the end of the 5 years.
Similarly, if the bond decreases in value by 15%, the receiver is required to pay
$15 million at the end of the 5 years. If there is a default on the bond, the swap is
usually terminated and the receiver makes a ﬁnal payment equal to the excess of $100
million over the market value of the bond.
If the notional principal is added to both sides at the end of the life of the swap, the
total return swap can be characterized as follows. The payer pays the cash ﬂows on an
investment of $100 million in the corporate bond. The receiver pays the cash ﬂows on a
$100 million bond paying LIBOR plus 25 basis points. If the payer owns the corporate
bond, the total return swap allows it to pass the credit risk on the bond to the receiver.
If it does not own the bond, the total return swap allows it to take a short position in
the bond.
Total return swaps are often used as a ﬁnancing tool. One scenario that could lead to
the swap in Figure 25.2 is as follows. The receiver wants ﬁnancing to invest $100 million
in the reference bond. It approaches the payer (which is likely to be a ﬁnancial
institution) and agrees to the swap. The payer then invests $100 million in the bond.
This leaves the receiver in the same position as it would have been if it had borrowed
money at LIBOR plus 25 basis points to buy the bond. The payer retains ownership of
the bond for the life of the swap and faces less credit risk than it would have done if it
had lent money to the receiver to ﬁnance the purchase of the bond, with the bond being
used as collateral for the loan. If the receiver defaults the payer does not have the legal
problem of trying to realize on the collateral. Total return swaps are similar to repos
(see Section 4.1) in that they are structured to minimize credit risk when securities are
being ﬁnanced.
The spread over LIBOR received by the payer is compensation for bearing the risk
that the receiver will default. The payer will lose money if the receiver defaults at a time
when the reference bond’s price has declined. The spread therefore depends on the
credit quality of the receiver, the credit quality of the bond issuer, and the correlation
between the two.
There are a number of variations on the standard deal we have described. Sometimes,
instead of there being a cash payment for the change in value of the bond, there is
physical settlement where the payer exchanges the underlying asset for the notional
principal at the end of the life of the swap. Sometimes the change-in-value payments are
made periodically rather than all at the end.

CHAPTER 25

25.8
COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS
We discussed asset-backed securities (ABSs) in Chapter 8. Figure 8.1 shows a simple
structure. An ABS where the underlying assets are bonds is known as a collateralized
debt obligation, or CDO. A waterfall similar to that indicated in Figure 8.2 is deﬁned for
the interest and principal payments on the bonds. The precise rules underlying the
waterfall are complicated, but they are designed to ensure that, if one tranche is more
senior than another, it is more likely to receive promised interest payments and
repayments of principal.
Synthetic CDOs
When a CDO is created from a bond portfolio, as just described, the resulting structure
is known as a cash CDO. In an important market development, it was recognized that a
long position in a corporate bond has a similar risk to a short position in a CDS when
the reference entity in the CDS is the company issuing the bond. This led an alternative
structure known as a synthetic CDO, which has become very popular.
The originator of a synthetic CDO chooses a portfolio of companies and a maturity
(e.g., 5 years) for the structure. It sells CDS protection on each company in the
portfolio with the CDS maturities equaling the maturity of the structure. The synthetic
CDO principal is the total of the notional principals underlying the CDSs. The
originator has cash inﬂows equal to the the CDS spreads and cash outﬂows when
companies in the portfolio default. Tranches are formed and the cash inﬂows and
outﬂows are distributed to tranches. The rules for determining the cash inﬂows and
outﬂows of tranches are more straightforward for a synthetic CDO than for a cash
CDO. Suppose that there are only three tranches: equity, mezzanine, and senior. The
rules might be as follows:
1. The equity tranche is responsible for the payouts on the CDSs until they reach 5%
of the synthetic CDO principal. It earns a spread of 1,000 basis points per year on
the outstanding tranche principal.
2. The mezzanine tranche is responsible for payouts in excess of 5% up to a
maximum of 20% of the synthetic CDO principal. It earns a spread of 100 basis
points per year on the outstanding tranche principal.
3. The senior tranche is responsible for payouts in excess of 20%. It earns a spread of
10 basis points per year on the outstanding tranche principal.
To understand how the synthetic CDO would work, suppose that its principal is
$100 million. The equity, mezzanine, and senior tranche principals are $5 million,
$15 million, and $80 million, respectively. The tranches initially earn the speciﬁed
spreads on these notional principals. Suppose that after 1 year defaults by companies
in the portfolio lead to payouts of $2 million on the CDSs. The equity tranche holders
are responsible for these payouts. The equity tranche principal reduces to $3 million
and its spread (1,000 basis points) is then earned on $3 million instead of $5 million. If,
later during the life of the CDO, there are further payouts of $4 million on the CDSs,
the cumulative of the payments required by the equity tranche is $5 million, so that its
outstanding principal becomes zero. The mezzanine tranche holders have to pay
$1 million. This reduces their outstanding principal to $14 million.

Cash CDOs require an initial investment by the tranche holders (to ﬁnance the
underlying bonds). By contrast, the holders of synthetic CDOs do not have to make
an initial investment. They just have to agree to the way cash inﬂows and outﬂows will
be calculated. In practice, they are almost invariably required to post the initial tranche
principal as collateral. When the tranche becomes responsible for a payoﬀon a CDS,
the money is taken out of the collateral. The balance in the collateral account earns
interest at LIBOR.
Standard Portfolios and Single-Tranche Trading
In the synthetic CDO we have described, the tranche holders sell protection to the
originator of the CDO, who in turn sells protection on CDSs to other market
participants. An innovation in the market was the trading of a tranche without the
underlying portfolio of short CDS positions being created. This is sometimes referred
to as single-tranche trading. There are two parties to a trade: the buyer of protection on
a tranche and the seller of protection on the tranche. The portfolio of short CDS
positions is used as a reference point to deﬁne the cash ﬂows between the two sides, but
it is not created. The buyer of protection pays the tranche spread to the seller of
protection, and the seller of protection pays amounts to the buyer that correspond to
those losses on the reference portfolio of CDSs that the tranche is responsible for.
In Section 25.3, we discussed CDS indices such as CDX NA IG and iTraxx Europe.
The market has used the portfolios underlying these indices to deﬁne standard synthetic
CDO tranches. These trade very actively. The six standard tranches of iTraxx Europe
cover losses in the ranges 0–3%, 3–6%, 6–9%, 9–12%, 12–22%, and 22–100%. The
six standard tranches of CDX NA IG cover losses in the ranges 0–3%, 3–7%, 7–10%,
10–15%, 15–30%, and 30–100%.
Table 25.6 shows the quotes for 5-year iTraxx tranches at the end of January of three
successive years. The index spread is the cost in basis points of buying protection on all
the companies in the index, as described in Section 25.3. The quotes for all tranches
except the 0–3% tranche is the cost in basis point per year of buying tranche protection.
(As explained earlier, this is paid on a principal that declines as the tranche experiences
losses.) In the case of the 0–3% (equity) tranche, the protection buyer makes an initial
payment and then pays 500 basis points per year on the outstanding tranche principal.
The quote is for the initial payment as a percentage of the initial tranche principal.
What a diﬀerence two years makes in the credit markets! Table 25.6 shows that the
credit crisis led to a huge increase in credit spreads. The iTraxx index rose from 23 basis

points in January 2007 to 165 basis points in January 2009. The individual tranche
quotes have also shown huge increases. One reason for the changes is that the default
probabilities assessed by the market for investment-grade corporations increased.
However, it is also the case that protection sellers were in many cases experiencing
liquidity problems. They became more averse to risk and increased the risk premiums
they required.
25.9
ROLE OF CORRELATION IN A BASKET CDS AND CDO
The cost of protection in a kth-to-default CDS or a tranche of a CDO is critically
dependent on default correlation. Suppose that a basket of 100 reference entities is used
to deﬁne a 5-year kth-to-default CDS and that each reference entity has a risk-neutral
probability of 2% of defaulting during the 5 years. When the default correlation
between the reference entities is zero the binomial distribution shows that the prob-
ability of one or more defaults during the 5 years is 86.74% and the probability of 10 or
more defaults is 0.0034%. A ﬁrst-to-default CDS is therefore quite valuable whereas a
tenth-to-default CDS is worth almost nothing.
As the default correlation increases the probability of one or more defaults declines
and the probability of 10 or more defaults increases. In the limit where the default
correlation between the reference entities is perfect the probability of one or more
defaults equals the probability of ten or more defaults and is 2%. This is because in this
extreme situation the reference entities are essentially the same. Either they all default
(with probability 2%) or none of them default (with probability 98%).
The valuation of a tranche of a synthetic CDO is similarly dependent on default
correlation. If the correlation is low, the junior equity tranche is very risky and the
senior tranches are very safe. As the default correlation increases, the junior tranches
become less risky and the senior tranches become more risky. In the limit where the
default correlation is perfect and the recovery rate is zero, the tranches are equally
risky.
25.10
VALUATION OF A SYNTHETIC CDO
Synthetic CDOs can be valued using the DerivaGem software. To explain the calcula-
tions, suppose that the payment dates on a synthetic CDO tranche are at times
1; 2; . . . ; m and 0 ¼ 0. Deﬁne Ej as the expected tranche principal at time j and
vðÞ as the present value of $1 received at time . Suppose that the spread on a
particular tranche (i.e., the number of basis points paid for protection) is s per year.
This spread is paid on the remaining tranche principal. The present value of the
expected regular spread payments on the CDO is therefore given by sA, where

The value of the tranche to the protection buyer is C  sA  sB. The breakeven spread
on the tranche occurs when the present value of the payments equals the present value
of the payoﬀs or
C ¼ sA þ sB
The breakeven spread is therefore
s ¼

ð25:4Þ
Equations (25.1) to (25.3) show the key role played by the expected tranche principal in
calculating the breakeven spread for a tranche. If we know the expected principal for a
tranche on all payment dates and we also know the zero-coupon yield curve, the
breakeven tranche spread can be calculated from equation (25.4).
Using the Gaussian Copula Model of Time to Default
The one-factor Gaussian copula model of time to default was introduced in Section 24.8.
This is the standard market model for valuing synthetic CDOs. All companies are
assumed to have the same probability QðtÞ of defaulting by time t. Equation (24.9)
converts this unconditional probability of default by time t to the probability of default
by time t conditional on the factor F:

ð25:5Þ
Here  is the copula correlation, assumed to be the same for any pair of companies.
In the calculation of QðtÞ, it is usually assumed that the hazard rate for a company is
constant and consistent with the index spread. The hazard rate that is assumed can be
calculated by using the CDS valuation approach in Section 25.2 and searching for the
hazard rate that gives the index spread. Suppose that this hazard rate is . Then, from
equation (24.1),
QðtÞ ¼ 1  et
ð25:6Þ
From the properties of the binomial distribution, the standard market model gives the
probability of exactly k defaults by time t, conditional on F, as

where n is the number of reference entities in the portfolio. Suppose that the tranche

Without loss of generality, we assume that the initial tranche principal is 1. The tranche
principal stays 1 while the number of defaults, k, is less than mðnLÞ. It is zero when the
number of defaults is greater than or equal to mðnHÞ. Otherwise, the tranche principal is

The variable F has a standard normal distribution. To calculate the unconditional
values of A, B, and C, it is necessary to integrate AðFÞ, BðFÞ, and CðFÞ over a standard
normal distribution. Once the unconditional values have been calculated, the breakeven
spread on the tranche can be calculated as C=ðA þ BÞ.9
The integration is best accomplished with a procedure known as Gaussian quadrature.

usually gives good results.
Example 25.2
Consider the mezzanine tranche of iTraxx Europe (5-year maturity) when the
copula correlation is 0.15 and the recovery rate is 40%. In this case, L ¼ 0:03,
H ¼ 0:06, n ¼ 125, nL ¼ 6:25, and nH ¼ 12:5. We suppose that the term structure
of interest rates is ﬂat at 3.5%, payments are made quarterly, and the CDS spread
on the index is 50 basis points. A calculation similar to that in Section 25.2 shows
that the constant hazard rate corresponding to the CDS spread is 0.83% (with
continuous compounding). An extract from the remaining calculations is shown
in Table 25.7. A value of M ¼ 60 is used in equation (25.12). The factor values, Fk,

principals on payment dates conditional on the factor values are calculated from
equations (25.5) to (25.8) and shown in the second segment of the table. The values
of A, B, and C conditional on the factor values are calculated in the last three
segments of the table using equations (25.9) to (25.11). The unconditional values of
A, B, and C are calculated by integrating AðFÞ, BðFÞ, and CðFÞ over the probability
distribution of F. This is done by setting gðFÞ equal in turn to AðFÞ, BðFÞ, and CðFÞ
in equation (25.12). The result is
A ¼ 4:2846;
B ¼ 0:0187;
C ¼ 0:1496
The breakeven tranche spread is 0:1496=ð4:2846 þ 0:0187Þ ¼ 0:0348, or 348 basis
points.
This result can be obtained from DerivaGem. The CDS worksheet is used to
convert the 50-basis-point spread to a hazard rate of 0.83%. The CDO worksheet
is then used with this hazard rate and 30 integration points.
Valuation of kth-to-Default CDS
A kth-to-default CDS (see Section 25.6) can also be valued using the standard market
model by conditioning on the factor F. The conditional probability that the kth default
happens between times j1 and j is the conditional probability that there are k or
more defaults by time j minus the conditional probability that there are k or more
defaults by time j1. This can be calculated from equations (25.5) to (25.7) as
X
n
q¼k
Pðq; j j FÞ 
X
n
q¼k
Pðq; j1 j FÞ
Defaults between time j1 and j can be assumed to happen at time 0:5j1 þ 0:5j. This
allows the present value of payments and of payoﬀs, conditional on F, to be calculated in
the same way as for regular CDS payoﬀs (see Section 25.2). By integrating over F, the
unconditional present values of payments and payoﬀs can be calculated.
Example 25.3
Consider a portfolio consisting of 10 bonds each with a hazard rate of 2% per
annum. Suppose we are interested in valuing a third-to-default CDS where pay-
ments are made annually in arrears. Assume that the copula correlation is 0.3,
the recovery rate is 40%, and all risk-free rates are 5%. As in Table 25.7, we
consider M ¼ 60 diﬀerent factor values. The unconditional cumulative probabil-
ity of each bond defaulting by years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 0.0198, 0.0392, 0.0582, 0.0769,
0.0952, respectively. Equation (25.5) shows that, conditional on F ¼ 1:0104,
these default probabilities are 0.0361, 0.0746, 0.1122, 0.1484, 0.1830, respectively.
From the binomial distribution, the conditional probability of three or more
defaults by times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years is 0.0047, 0.0335, 0.0928, 0.1757, 0.2717,
respectively. The conditional probability of the third default happening during
years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is therefore 0.0047, 0.0289, 0.0593, 0.0829, 0.0960, respectively.
An analysis similar to that in Section 25.2 shows that the present values of
payoﬀs, regular payments, and accrual payments conditional on F ¼ 1:0104
are 0:1379; 3:8443s, and 0:1149s, where s is the spread. Similar calculations are
carried out for the other 59 factor values and equation (25.12) is used to integrate
over F. The unconditional present values of payoﬀs, regular payments, and
Credit Derivatives
611

accrual payments are 0:0629, 4:0580s, and 0:0524s. The breakeven CDS spread is
therefore 0:0629=ð4:0580 þ 0:0524Þ ¼ 0:0153, or 153 basis points.
Implied Correlation
In the standard market model, the recovery rate R is usually assumed to be 40%. This
leaves the copula correlation  as the only unknown parameter. This makes the model
similar to Black–Scholes–Merton, where there is only one unknown parameter, the
volatility. Market participants like to imply a correlation from the market quotes for
tranches in the same way that they imply a volatility from the market prices of options.
Suppose that the values of fL; Hg for successively more senior tranches are
f0; 1g, f1; 2g, f2; 3g, . . . , with 0 ¼ 0. (For example, in the case of iTraxx Europe,
0 ¼ 0, 1 ¼ 0:03, 2 ¼ 0:06, 3 ¼ 0:09, 4 ¼ 0:12, 5 ¼ 0:22, 6 ¼ 1:00.) There are
two alternative implied correlation measures. One is compound correlation or tranche
correlation. For a tranche fq1; qg, this is the value of the correlation, , that leads to
the spread calculated from the model being the same as the spread in the market. It is
found using an iterative search. The other is base correlation. For a particular value of
q ðq > 1Þ, this is the value of  that leads to the f0; qg tranche being priced
consistently with the market. It is obtained using the following steps:
1. Calculate the compound correlation for each tranche.
2. Use the compound correlation to calculate the present value of the expected loss
on each tranche during the life of the CDO as a percent of the initial tranche
principal. This is the variable we have deﬁned as C above. Suppose that the value
of C for the fq1; qg tranche is Cq.
3. Calculate the present value of the expected loss on the f0; qg tranche as a percent
of the total principal of the underlying portfolio. This is Pq

CHAPTER 25

4. The C-value for the f0; qg tranche is the value calculated in Step 3 divided by q.
The base correlation is the value of the correlation parameter, , that is consistent
with this C-value. It is found using an iterative search.
The present value of the loss as a percent of underlying portfolio that would be calculated
in Step 3 for the iTraxx Europe quotes for January 31, 2007, given in Table 25.6 are
shown in Figure 25.3. The implied correlations for these quotes are shown in Table 25.8.
The calculations were carried out using DerivaGem assuming that the term structure of
interest rates is ﬂat at 3% and the recovery rate is 40%. The CDSs worksheet shows that
the 23-basis-point spread implies a hazard rate of 0.382%. The implied correlations are
calculated using the CDOs worksheet. The values underlying Figure 25.3 can also be
calculated with this worksheet using the expression in Step 3 above.
The correlation patterns in Table 25.8 are typical of those usually observed. The
compound correlations exhibit a ‘‘correlation smile’’. As the tranche becomes more
senior, the implied correlation ﬁrst decreases and then increases. The base correlations
exhibit a correlation skew where the implied correlation is an increasing function of the
tranche detachment point.
If market prices were consistent with the one-factor Gaussian copula model, then the
implied correlations (both compound and base) would be the same for all tranches.
From the pronounced smiles and skews that are observed in practice, we can infer that
market prices are not consistent with this model.
Valuing Nonstandard Tranches
We do not need a model to value the standard tranches of a standard portfolio such as
iTraxx Europe because the spreads for these tranches can be observed in the market.
Sometimes quotes need to be produced for nonstandard tranches of a standard
portfolio. Suppose that you need a quote for the 4–8% iTraxx Europe tranche. One
approach is to interpolate base correlations so as to estimate the base correlation for the
0–4% tranche and the 0–8% tranche. These two base correlations allow the present
value of expected loss (as a percent of the underlying portfolio principal) to be
estimated for these tranches. The present value of the expected loss for the 4–8%
tranche (as a percent of the underlying principal) can be estimated as the diﬀerence
between the present value of expected losses for the 0–8% and 0–4% tranches. This can
be used to imply a compound correlation and a breakeven spread for the tranche.
It is now recognized that this is not the best way to proceed. A better approach is to
calculate expected losses for each of the standard tranches and produce a chart such as
Table 25.8

Figure 25.3 showing the variation of expected loss for the 0–X% tranche with X. Values
on this chart can be interpolated to give the expected loss for the 0–4% and the 0–8%
tranches. The diﬀerence between these expected losses is a better estimate of the
expected loss on the 4–8% tranche than that obtained from the base correlation
approach.
It can be shown that for no arbitrage the expected losses when calculated as in
Figure 25.3 must increase with X at a decreasing rate. If base correlations are interpolated
and then used to calculate expected losses, this no-arbitrage condition is often not
satisﬁed. (The problem here is that the base correlation for the 0–X% tranche is a
nonlinear function of the expected loss on the 0–X% tranche.) The direct approach of
interpolating expected losses is therefore much better than the indirect approach of
interpolating base correlations. What is more, it can be done so as to ensure that the
no-arbitrage condition just mentioned is satisﬁed.

ALTERNATIVES TO THE STANDARD MARKET MODEL
This section outlines a number of alternatives to the one-factor Gaussian copula model
that has become the market standard.
Heterogeneous Model
The standard market model is a homogeneous model in the sense that the time-to-
default probability distributions are assumed to be the same for all companies and the
copula correlations for any pair of companies are the same. The homogeneity assump-
tion can be relaxed so that a more general model is used. However, this model is more
complicated to implement because each company has a diﬀerent probability of default-
ing by any given time and Pðk; t j FÞ can no longer be calculated using the binomial
formula in equation (25.7). It is necessary to use a numerical procedure such as that
described in Andersen et al. (2003) and Hull and White (2004).11
Other Copulas
The one-factor Gaussian copula model is a particular model of the correlation between
times to default. Many other one-factor copula models have been proposed. These
include the Student t copula, the Clayton copula, Archimedean copula, and Marshall–
Olkin copula. We can also create new one-factor copulas by assuming that F and the Zi
in equation (24.10) have nonnormal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
Hull and White show that a good ﬁt to the market is obtained when F and the Zi have
Student t distributions with four degrees of freedom.12 They call this the double t copula.
Another approach is to increase the number of factors in the model. Unfortunately,
the model is then much slower to run because it is necessary to integrate over several
normal distributions instead of just one.

CHAPTER 25

Random Factor Loadings
Andersen and Sidenius have suggested a model where the copula correlation  in
equation (25.5) is a function of F.13
In general,  increases as F decreases. This means that in states of the world where the
default rate is high (i.e., states of the world where F is low) the default correlation is also
high. There is empirical evidence suggesting that this is the case.14 Andersen and Sidenius
ﬁnd that this model ﬁts market quotes much better than the standard market model.
The Implied Copula Model
Hull and White show how a copula can be implied from market quotes.15 The simplest
version of the model assumes that a certain average hazard rate applies to all companies
in a portfolio over the life of a CDO. That average hazard rate has a probability
distribution that can be implied from the pricing of tranches. The calculation of the
implied copula is similar in concept to the idea, discussed in Chapter 20, of calculating
an implied probability distribution for a stock price from option prices.
Dynamic Models
The models discussed so far can be characterized as static models. In essence they
model the average default environment over the life of the CDO. The model con-
structed for a 5-year CDO is diﬀerent from the model constructed for a 7-year CDO,
which is in turn diﬀerent from the model constructed for a 10-year CDO. Dynamic
models are diﬀerent from static models in that they attempt to model the evolution of
the loss on a portfolio through time. There are three diﬀerent types of dynamic
models:
1. Structural Models: These are similar to the models described in Section 24.6
except that the stochastic processes for the asset prices of many companies are
modeled simultaneously. When the asset price for a company reaches a barrier,
there is a default. The processes followed by the assets are correlated. The problem
with these types of models is that they have to be implemented with Monte Carlo
simulation and calibration is therefore diﬃcult.
2. Reduced Form Models: In these models the hazard rates of companies are modeled.
In order to build in a realistic amount of correlation, it is necessary to assume that
there are jumps in the hazard rates.

3. Top Down Models: These are models where the total loss on a portfolio is
modeled directly. The models do not consider what happens to individual
companies.
SUMMARY
Credit derivatives enable banks and other ﬁnancial institutions to actively manage their
credit risks. They can be used to transfer credit risk from one company to another and
to diversify credit risk by swapping one type of exposure for another.
The most common credit derivative is a credit default swap. This is a contract where
one company buys insurance from another company against a third company (the
reference entity) defaulting on its obligations. The payoﬀis usually the diﬀerence
between the face value of a bond issued by the reference entity and its value immedi-
ately after a default. Credit default swaps can be analyzed by calculating the present
value of the expected payments and the present value of the expected payoﬀin a risk-
neutral world.
A forward credit default swap is an obligation to enter into a particular credit default
swap on a particular date. A credit default swap option is the right to enter into a
particular credit default swap on a particular date. Both instruments cease to exist if the
reference entity defaults before the date. A kth-to-default CDS is deﬁned as a CDS that
pays oﬀwhen the kth default occurs in a portfolio of companies.
A total return swap is an instrument where the total return on a portfolio of credit-
sensitive assets is exchanged for LIBOR plus a spread. Total return swaps are often used
as ﬁnancing vehicles. A company wanting to purchase a portfolio of assets will approach
a ﬁnancial institution to buy the assets on its behalf. The ﬁnancial institution then enters
into a total return swap with the company where it pays the return on the assets to the
company and receives LIBOR plus a spread. The advantage of this type of arrangement
is that the ﬁnancial institution reduces its exposure to a default by the company.
In a collateralized debt obligation a number of diﬀerent securities are created from a
portfolio of corporate bonds or commercial loans. There are rules for determining how
credit losses are allocated. The result of the rules is that securities with both very high
and very low credit ratings are created from the portfolio. A synthetic collateralized
debt obligation creates a similar set of securities from credit default swaps. The
standard market model for pricing both a kth-to-default CDS and tranches of a
synthetic CDO is the one-factor Gaussian copula model for time to default.

Practice Questions (Answers in Solutions Manual)
25.1. Explain the diﬀerence between a regular credit default swap and a binary credit default
swap.
25.2. A credit default swap requires a semiannual payment at the rate of 60 basis points per
year. The principal is $300 million and the credit default swap is settled in cash.
A default occurs after 4 years and 2 months, and the calculation agent estimates that the
price of the cheapest deliverable bond is 40% of its face value shortly after the default.
List the cash ﬂows and their timing for the seller of the credit default swap.
25.3. Explain the two ways a credit default swap can be settled.
25.4. Explain how a cash CDO and a synthetic CDO are created.

as the default correlation between the companies in the basket increases? Explain.
25.6. Explain the diﬀerence between risk-neutral and real-world default probabilities.
25.7. Explain why a total return swap can be useful as a ﬁnancing tool.
25.8. Suppose that the risk-free zero curve is ﬂat at 7% per annum with continuous

reference entities where each reference entity has a probability of defaulting in each year
of 1%. As the default correlation between the reference entities increases what would
you expect to happen to the value of the swap when (a) n ¼ 1 and (b) n ¼ 25. Explain
your answer.

25.14. Verify that, if the CDS spread for the example in Tables 25.1 to 25.4 is 100 basis points,
the hazard rate must be 1.63% per year. How does the hazard rate change when the
recovery rate is 20% instead of 40%? Verify that your answer is consistent with the
implied hazard rate being approximately proportional to 1=ð1  RÞ, where R is the
recovery rate.

25.17. ‘‘The position of a buyer of a credit default swap is similar to the position of someone
who is long a risk-free bond and short a corporate bond.’’ Explain this statement.
25.18. Why is there a potential asymmetric information problem in credit default swaps?
25.19. Does valuing a CDS using real-world default probabilities rather than risk-neutral
default probabilities overstate or understate its value? Explain your answer.
25.20. What is the diﬀerence between a total return swap and an asset swap?
25.21. Suppose that in a one-factor Gaussian copula model the 5-year probability of default for
each of 125 names is 3% and the pairwise copula correlation is 0.2. Calculate, for factor
values of 2, 1, 0, 1, and 2: (a) the default probability conditional on the factor value
and (b) the probability of more than 10 defaults conditional on the factor value.
25.22. Explain the diﬀerence between base correlation and compound correlation.
25.23. In Example 25.2, what is the tranche spread for the 9% to 12% tranche assuming a
tranche correlation of 0.15?
Further Questions
25.24. Suppose that the risk-free zero curve is ﬂat at 6% per annum with continuous
compounding and that defaults can occur at times 0.25 years, 0.75 years, 1.25 years,
and 1.75 years in a 2-year plain vanilla credit default swap with semiannual payments.
Suppose that the recovery rate is 20% and the unconditional probabilities of default (as
seen at time zero) are 1% at times 0.25 years and 0.75 years, and 1.5% at times 1.25
years and 1.75 years. What is the credit default swap spread? What would the credit
default spread be if the instrument were a binary credit default swap?
25.25. Assume that the hazard rate for a company is  and the recovery rate is R. The risk-free
interest rate is 5% per annum. Default always occurs halfway through a year. The spread
for a 5-year plain vanilla CDS where payments are made annually is 120 basis points and
the spread for a 5-year binary CDS where payments are made annually is 160 basis
points. Estimate R and .
25.26. Explain how you would expect the returns oﬀered on the various tranches in a synthetic
CDO to change when the correlation between the bonds in the portfolio increases.
25.27. Suppose that:
(a) The yield on a 5-year risk-free bond is 7%.
(b) The yield on a 5-year corporate bond issued by company X is 9.5%.
(c) A 5-year credit default swap providing insurance against company X defaulting
costs 150 basis points per year.

CHAPTER 25

What arbitrage opportunity is there in this situation? What arbitrage opportunity would
there be if the credit default spread were 300 basis points instead of 150 basis points?
25.28. In Example 25.3, what is the spread for (a) a ﬁrst-to-default CDS and (b) a second-to-
default CDS?
25.29. In Example 25.2, what is the tranche spread for the 6% to 9% tranche assuming a
tranche correlation of 0.15?
25.30. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year CDS spreads are 100, 120, 135, 145, and 152 basis points,
respectively. The risk-free rate is 3% for all maturities, the recovery rate is 35%, and
payments are quarterly. Use DerivaGem to calculate the hazard rate each year. What is
the probability of default in year 1? What is the probability of default in year 2?
25.31. Table 25.6 shows the 5-year iTraxx index was 77 basis points on January 31, 2008.
Assume the risk-free rate is 5% for all maturities, the recovery rate is 40%, and
payments are quarterly. Assume also that the spread of 77 basis points applies to all
maturities. Use the DerivaGem CDS worksheet to calculate a hazard rate consistent
with the spread. Use this in the CDO worksheet with 10 integration points to imply base
correlations for each tranche from the quotes for January 31, 2008.

Exotic Options
Derivatives such as European and American call and put options are what are termed
plain vanilla products. They have standard well-deﬁned properties and trade actively.
Their prices or implied volatilities are quoted by exchanges or by interdealer brokers
on a regular basis. One of the exciting aspects of the over-the-counter derivatives
market is the number of nonstandard products that have been created by ﬁnancial
engineers. These products are termed exotic options, or simply exotics. Although they
usually constitute a relatively small part of its portfolio, these exotics are important to
a derivatives dealer because they are generally much more proﬁtable than plain
vanilla products.
Exotic products are developed for a number of reasons. Sometimes they meet a
genuine hedging need in the market; sometimes there are tax, accounting, legal, or
regulatory reasons why corporate treasurers, fund managers, and ﬁnancial institutions
ﬁnd exotic products attractive; sometimes the products are designed to reﬂect a view on
potential future movements in particular market variables; occasionally an exotic
product is designed by a derivatives dealer to appear more attractive than it is to an
unwary corporate treasurer or fund manager.
In this chapter, we describe some of the more commonly occurring exotic options
and discuss their valuation. We assume that the underlying asset provides a yield at rate
q. As discussed in Chapters 17 and 18, for an option on a stock index q should be set
equal to the dividend yield on the index, for an option on a currency it should be set
equal to the foreign risk-free rate, and for an option on a futures contract it should be
set equal to the domestic risk-free rate. Many of the options discussed in this chapter
can be valued using the DerivaGem software.
26.1
PACKAGES
A package is a portfolio consisting of standard European calls, standard European
puts, forward contracts, cash, and the underlying asset itself. We discussed a number of
diﬀerent types of packages in Chapter 12: bull spreads, bear spreads, butterﬂy spreads,
calendar spreads, straddles, strangles, and so on.
620

C H A P T E R

Often a package is structured by traders so that it has zero cost initially. An example
is a range forward contract.1 This was discussed in Section 17.2. It consists of a long call
and a short put or a short call and a long put. The call strike price is greater than the
put strike price and the strike prices are chosen so that the value of the call equals the
value of the put.
It is worth noting that any derivative can be converted into a zero-cost product by
deferring payment until maturity. Consider a European call option. If c is the cost of
the option when payment is made at time zero, then A ¼ cerT is the cost when payment
is made at time T, the maturity of the option. The payoﬀis then maxðST  K; 0Þ  A or
maxðST  K  A; AÞ. When the strike price, K, equals the forward price, other names
for a deferred payment option are break forward, Boston option, forward with optional
exit, and cancelable forward.
26.2
PERPETUAL AMERICAN CALL AND PUT OPTIONS
The diﬀerential equation that must be satisﬁed by the price of a derivative when there is
a dividend at rate q is equation (17.6):
@f
@t þ ðr  qÞS @f
@S þ 1
22S2 @2f
@S2 ¼ rf
Consider a derivative that pays oﬀa ﬁxed amount Q when S ¼ H for the ﬁrst time. If
S < H, the boundary conditions for the diﬀerential equation are that f ¼ Q when
S ¼ H and f ¼ 0 when S ¼ 0. The solution f ¼ QðS=HÞ satisﬁes the boundary
conditions when  > 0. Furthermore, it satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation when
ðr  qÞ þ 1
2ð  1Þ2 ¼ r
The positive solution to this equation is  ¼ 1, where
1 ¼ w þ

w2 þ 22r
p
2
and w ¼ r  q  2=2. It follows that the value of the derivative must be QðS=HÞ1
because this satisﬁes the boundary conditions and the diﬀerential equation.
Consider next a perpetual American call option with strike price K. If the option is
exercised when S ¼ H, the payoﬀis H  K and from the result just proved the value of
the option is ðH  KÞðS=HÞ1. The holder of the call option can choose the asset price,
H, at which the option is exercised. The optimal H is the one that maximizes the value
we have just calculated. Using standard calculus methods, it is H ¼ H1, where
H1 ¼ K

1 Other names used for a range forward contract are zero-cost collar, ﬂexible forward, cylinder option,
option fence, min–max, and forward band.

The price of a perpetual call if S < H1 is therefore

If S > H1, the call should be exercised immediately and is worth S  K.
To value an American put, we consider a derivative that pays oﬀQ when S ¼ H in
the situation where S > H (so that the barrier H is reached from above). In this case,
the boundary conditions for the diﬀerential equation are that f ¼ Q when S ¼ H and
f ¼ 0 as S tends to inﬁnity. In this case, the solution f ¼ QðS=HÞ satisﬁes the
boundary conditions when  > 0. As above, we can show that it also satisﬁes the
diﬀerential equation when  ¼ 2, where
2 ¼ w þ

If the holder of the American put chooses to exercise when S ¼ H, the value of the put
is ðK  HÞðS=HÞ2. The holder of the put will choose the exercise level H ¼ H2 to
maximize this. This is
H2 ¼ K

If S < H2, the put should be exercised immediately and is worth K  S.
Section 15.6 and Problem 15.23 give particular cases of the results here for q ¼ 0.
26.3
NONSTANDARD AMERICAN OPTIONS
In a standard American option, exercise can take place at any time during the life of the
option and the exercise price is always the same. The American options that are traded
in the over-the-counter market sometimes have nonstandard features. For example:
1. Early exercise may be restricted to certain dates. The instrument is then known as
a Bermudan option. (Bermuda is between Europe and America!)
2. Early exercise may be allowed during only part of the life of the option. For
example, there may be an initial ‘‘lock out’’ period with no early exercise.
3. The strike price may change during the life of the option.
The warrants issued by corporations on their own stock often have some or all of these
features. For example, in a 7-year warrant, exercise might be possible on particular dates
during years 3 to 7, with the strike price being $30 during years 3 and 4, $32 during the
next 2 years, and $33 during the ﬁnal year.
Nonstandard American options can usually be valued using a binomial tree. At each
node, the test (if any) for early exercise is adjusted to reﬂect the terms of the option.

CHAPTER 26

26.4
GAP OPTIONS
A gap call option is a European call options that pays oﬀST  K1 when ST > K2. The
diﬀerence between a gap call option and a regular call option with a strike price of K2 is
that the payoﬀwhen ST > K2 is increased by K2  K1. (This increase is positive or
negative depending on whether K2 > K1 or K1 > K2.)
A gap call option can be valued by a small modiﬁcation to the Black–Scholes–
Merton formula. With our usual notation, the value is
S0eqTNðd1Þ  K1erTNðd2Þ
ð26:1Þ
where
d1 ¼ lnðS0=K2Þ þ ðr  q þ 2=2ÞT

ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

d2 ¼ d1  

The price in this formula is greater than the price given by the Black–Scholes–Merton
formula for a regular call option with strike price K2 by
ðK2  K1ÞerTNðd2Þ
To understand this diﬀerence, note that the probability that the option will be exercised
is Nðd2Þ and, when it is exercised, the payoﬀto the holder of the gap option is greater
than that to the holder of the regular option by K2  K1.
For a gap put option, the payoﬀis K1  ST when ST < K2. The value of the option is
K1erTNðd2Þ  S0eqTNðd1Þ
ð26:2Þ
where d1 and d2 are deﬁned as for equation (26.1).
Example 26.1
An asset is currently worth $500,000. Over the next year, it is expected to have a
volatility of 20%. The risk-free rate is 5%, and no income is expected. Suppose
that an insurance company agrees to buy the asset for $400,000 if its value has
fallen below $400,000 at the end of one year. The payout will be 400,000  ST
whenever the value of the asset is less than $400,000. The insurance company has
provided a regular put option where the policyholder has the right to sell the asset
to the insurance company for $400,000 in one year. This can be valued using
equation (15.21), with S0 ¼ 500,000, K ¼ 400,000, r ¼ 0:05,  ¼ 0:2, T ¼ 1. The
value is $3,436.
Suppose next that the cost of transferring the asset is $50,000 and this cost is
borne by the policyholder. The option is then exercised only if the value of the
asset is less than $350,000. In this case, the cost to the insurance company is
K1  ST when ST < K2, where K2 ¼ 350,000, K1 ¼ 400,000, and ST is the price
of the asset in one year. This is a gap put option. The value is given by equa-
tion (26.2), with S0 ¼ 500,000, K1 ¼ 400,000, K2 ¼ 350,000, r ¼ 0:05, q ¼ 0,
 ¼ 0:2, T ¼ 1. It is $1,896. Recognizing the costs to the policyholder of making
a claim reduces the cost of the policy to the insurance company by about 45% in
this case.

26.5
FORWARD START OPTIONS
Forward start options are options that will start at some time in the future. Sometimes
employee stock options, which were discussed in Chapter 16, can be viewed as forward
start options. This is because the company commits (implicitly or explicitly) to granting
at-the-money options to employees in the future.
Consider a forward start at-the-money European call option that will start at time T1
and mature at time T2. Suppose that the asset price is S0 at time zero and S1 at time T1.
To value the option, we note from the European option pricing formulas in Chapters 15
and 17 that the value of an at-the-money call option on an asset is proportional to the
asset price. The value of the forward start option at time T1 is therefore cS1=S0, where c
is the value at time zero of an at-the-money option that lasts for T2  T1. Using risk-
neutral valuation, the value of the forward start option at time zero is
erT1 ^E

c S1
S0

where ^E denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. Since c and S0 are known and
^E½S1 ¼ S0eðrqÞT1, the value of the forward start option is ceqT1. For a non-dividend-
paying stock, q ¼ 0 and the value of the forward start option is exactly the same as the
value of a regular at-the-money option with the same life as the forward start option.
26.6
CLIQUET OPTIONS
A cliquet option (which is also called a ratchet or strike reset option) is a series of call or
put options with rules for determining the strike price. Suppose that the reset dates are
at times , 2, . . . , ðn  1Þ, with n being the end of the cliquet’s life. A simple structure
would be as follows. The ﬁrst option has a strike price K (which might equal the initial
asset price) and lasts between times 0 and ; the second option provides a payoﬀat time
2 with a strike price equal to the value of the asset at time ; the third option provides
a payoﬀat time 3 with a strike price equal to the value of the asset at time 2; and so
on. This is a regular option plus n  1 forward start options. The latter can be valued as
described in Section 26.5.
Some cliquet options are much more complicated than the one described here. For
example, sometimes there are upper and lower limits on the total payoﬀover the whole
period; sometimes cliquets terminate at the end of a period if the asset price is in a
certain range. When analytic results are not available, Monte Carlo simulation is often
the best approach for valuation.
26.7
COMPOUND OPTIONS
Compound options are options on options. There are four main types of compound
options: a call on a call, a put on a call, a call on a put, and a put on a put. Compound
options have two strike prices and two exercise dates. Consider, for example, a call on a
call. On the ﬁrst exercise date, T1, the holder of the compound option is entitled to pay
the ﬁrst strike price, K1, and receive a call option. The call option gives the holder the
624
CHAPTER 26

right to buy the underlying asset for the second strike price, K2, on the second exercise
date, T2. The compound option will be exercised on the ﬁrst exercise date only if the
value of the option on that date is greater than the ﬁrst strike price.
When the usual geometric Brownian motion assumption is made, European-style
compound options can be valued analytically in terms of integrals of the bivariate
normal distribution.2 With our usual notation, the value at time zero of a European call
option on a call option is

The function Mða; b : Þ is the cumulative bivariate normal distribution function that
the ﬁrst variable will be less than a and the second will be less than b when the coeﬃcient
of correlation between the two is .3 The variable S  is the asset price at time T1 for
which the option price at time T1 equals K1. If the actual asset price is above S  at time
T1, the ﬁrst option will be exercised; if it is not above S , the option expires worthless.

CHOOSER OPTIONS
A chooser option (sometimes referred to as an as you like it option) has the feature that,
after a speciﬁed period of time, the holder can choose whether the option is a call or a
put. Suppose that the time when the choice is made is T1. The value of the chooser
option at this time is
maxðc; pÞ
where c is the value of the call underlying the option and p is the value of the put
underlying the option.
If the options underlying the chooser option are both European and have the same
strike price, put–call parity can be used to provide a valuation formula. Suppose that S1

is the asset price at time T1, K is the strike price, T2 is the maturity of the options, and r
is the risk-free interest rate. Put–call parity implies that
maxðc; pÞ ¼ maxðc; c þ KerðT2T1Þ  S1eqðT2T1ÞÞ
¼ c þ eqðT2T1Þ maxð0; KeðrqÞðT2T1Þ  S1Þ
This shows that the chooser option is a package consisting of:
1. A call option with strike price K and maturity T2
2. eqðT2T1Þ put options with strike price KeðrqÞðT2T1Þ and maturity T1
As such, it can readily be valued.
More complex chooser options can be deﬁned where the call and the put do not have
the same strike price and time to maturity. They are then not packages and have
features that are somewhat similar to compound options.
26.9
BARRIER OPTIONS
Barrier options are options where the payoﬀdepends on whether the underlying asset’s
price reaches a certain level during a certain period of time.
A number of diﬀerent types of barrier options regularly trade in the over-the-counter
market. They are attractive to some market participants because they are less expensive
than the corresponding regular options. These barrier options can be classiﬁed as either
knock-out options or knock-in options. A knock-out option ceases to exist when the
underlying asset price reaches a certain barrier; a knock-in option comes into existence
only when the underlying asset price reaches a barrier.
Equations (17.4) and (17.5) show that the values at time zero of a regular call and put
option are
c ¼ S0eqTNðd1Þ  KerTNðd2Þ
p ¼ KerTNðd2Þ  S0eqTNðd1Þ

A down-and-out call is one type of knock-out option. It is a regular call option that
ceases to exist if the asset price reaches a certain barrier level H. The barrier level is
below the initial asset price. The corresponding knock-in option is a down-and-in call.
This is a regular call that comes into existence only if the asset price reaches the barrier
level.
If H is less than or equal to the strike price, K, the value of a down-and-in call at time
zero is

An up-and-out call is a regular call option that ceases to exist if the asset price reaches a
barrier level, H, that is higher than the current asset price. An up-and-in call is a regular
call option that comes into existence only if the barrier is reached. When H is less than
or equal to K, the value of the up-and-out call, cuo, is zero and the value of the up-and-
in call, cui, is c. When H is greater than K,

Put barrier options are deﬁned similarly to call barrier options. An up-and-out put is a
put option that ceases to exist when a barrier, H, that is greater than the current asset
price is reached. An up-and-in put is a put that comes into existence only if the barrier
is reached. When the barrier, H, is greater than or equal to the strike price, K, their

All of these valuations make the usual assumption that the probability distribution for
the asset price at a future time is lognormal. An important issue for barrier options is the
frequency with which the asset price, S, is observed for purposes of determining whether
the barrier has been reached. The analytic formulas given in this section assume that S is
observed continuously and sometimes this is the case.4 Often, the terms of a contract
state that S is observed periodically; for example, once a day at 3 p.m. Broadie, Glasser-
man, and Kou provide a way of adjusting the formulas we have just given for the
situation where the price of the underlying is observed discretely.5 The barrier level H is
replaced by He0:5826
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T=m
p
for an up-and-in or up-and-out option and by He0:5826
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T=m
p
for a down-and-in or down-and-out option, where m is the number of times the asset
price is observed (so that T=m is the time interval between observations).
Barrier options often have quite diﬀerent properties from regular options. For
example, sometimes vega is negative. Consider an up-and-out call option when the
asset price is close to the barrier level. As volatility increases, the probability that the
barrier will be hit increases. As a result, a volatility increase can cause the price of the
barrier option to decrease in these circumstances.
One disadvantage of the barrier options we have considered so far is that a ‘‘spike’’ in
the asset price can cause the option to be knocked in or out. An alternative structure is
a Parisian option, where the asset price has to be above or below the barrier for a period
of time for the option to be knocked in or out. For example, a down-and-out Parisian
put option with a strike price equal to 90% of the initial asset price and a barrier at
75% of the initial asset price might specify that the option is knocked out if the asset
price is below the barrier for 50 days. The conﬁrmation might specify that the 50 days
are a ‘‘continuous period of 50 days’’ or ‘‘any 50 days during the option’s life.’’ Parisian
options are more diﬃcult to value than regular barrier options.6 Monte Carlo simula-
tion and binomial trees can be used with the enhancements discussed in Sections 27.5
and 27.6.
26.10
BINARY OPTIONS
Binary options are options with discontinuous payoﬀs. A simple example of a binary
option is a cash-or-nothing call. This pays oﬀnothing if the asset price ends up below
4 One way to track whether a barrier has been reached from below (above) is to send a limit order to the
exchange to sell (buy) the asset at the barrier price and see whether the order is ﬁlled.

CHAPTER 26

the strike price at time T and pays a ﬁxed amount, Q, if it ends up above the strike
price. In a risk-neutral world, the probability of the asset price being above the strike
price at the maturity of an option is, with our usual notation, Nðd2Þ. The value of a
cash-or-nothing call is therefore QerTNðd2Þ. A cash-or-nothing put is deﬁned analo-
gously to a cash-or-nothing call. It pays oﬀQ if the asset price is below the strike price
and nothing if it is above the strike price. The value of a cash-or-nothing put is
QerTNðd2Þ.
Another type of binary option is an asset-or-nothing call. This pays oﬀnothing if the
underlying asset price ends up below the strike price and pays the asset price if it ends
up above the strike price. With our usual notation, the value of an asset-or-nothing call
is S0eqTNðd1Þ. An asset-or-nothing put pays oﬀnothing if the underlying asset price
ends up above the strike price and the asset price if it ends up below the strike price. The
value of an asset-or-nothing put is S0eqTNðd1Þ.
A regular European call option is equivalent to a long position in an asset-or-nothing
call and a short position in a cash-or-nothing call where the cash payoﬀin the cash-or-
nothing call equals the strike price. Similarly, a regular European put option is equivalent
to a long position in a cash-or-nothing put and a short position in an asset-or-nothing
put where the cash payoﬀon the cash-or-nothing put equals the strike price.
26.11
LOOKBACK OPTIONS
The payoﬀs from lookback options depend on the maximum or minimum asset price
reached during the life of the option. The payoﬀfrom a ﬂoating lookback call is the
amount that the ﬁnal asset price exceeds the minimum asset price achieved during the
life of the option. The payoﬀfrom a ﬂoating lookback put is the amount by which the
maximum asset price achieved during the life of the option exceeds the ﬁnal asset price.
Valuation formulas have been produced for ﬂoating lookbacks.7 The value of a
ﬂoating lookback call at time zero is

and Smax is the maximum asset price achieved to date. (If the lookback has just been

A ﬂoating lookback call is a way that the holder can buy the underlying asset at the
lowest price achieved during the life of the option. Similarly, a ﬂoating lookback put is a
way that the holder can sell the underlying asset at the highest price achieved during the
life of the option.
Example 26.2
Consider a newly issued ﬂoating lookback put on a non-dividend-paying stock
where the stock price is 50, the stock price volatility is 40% per annum, the
risk-free rate is 10% per annum, and the time to maturity is 3 months. In this
case, Smax ¼ 50, S0 ¼ 50, r ¼ 0:1, q ¼ 0,  ¼ 0:4, and T ¼ 0:25, b1 ¼ 0:025,
b2 ¼ 0:225, b3 ¼ 0:025, and Y2 ¼ 0, so that the value of the lookback put
is 7.79. A newly issued ﬂoating lookback call on the same stock is worth 8.04.
In a ﬁxed lookback option, a strike price is speciﬁed. For a ﬁxed lookback call option,
the payoﬀis the same as a regular European call option except that the ﬁnal asset price
is replaced by the maximum asset price achieved during the life of the option. For a
ﬁxed lookback put option, the payoﬀis the same as a regular European put option
except that the the ﬁnal asset price is replaced by the minimum asset price achieved
during the life of the option. Deﬁne S 
max ¼ maxðSmax; KÞ, where as before Smax is the
maximum asset price achieved to date and K is the strike price. Also, deﬁne p
ﬂas the
value of a ﬂoating lookback put which lasts for the same period as the ﬁxed lookback
call when the actual maximum asset price so far, Smax, is replaced by S 
max. A put–call

to price ﬁxed lookbacks.
Lookbacks are appealing to investors, but very expensive when compared with
regular options. As with barrier options, the value of a lookback option is liable to
be sensitive to the frequency with which the asset price is observed for the purposes of
computing the maximum or minimum. The formulas above assume that the asset price
is observed continuously. Broadie, Glasserman, and Kou provide a way of adjusting the
formulas we have just given for the situation where the asset price is observed
discretely.9
26.12
SHOUT OPTIONS
A shout option is a European option where the holder can ‘‘shout’’ to the writer at one
time during its life. At the end of the life of the option, the option holder receives either
the usual payoﬀfrom a European option or the intrinsic value at the time of the shout,
whichever is greater. Suppose the strike price is $50 and the holder of a call shouts when
the price of the underlying asset is $60. If the ﬁnal asset price is less than $60, the holder
receives a payoﬀof $10. If it is greater than $60, the holder receives the excess of the
asset price over $50.
A shout option has some of the same features as a lookback option, but is
considerably less expensive. It can be valued by noting that if the holder shouts at a
time  when the asset price is S the payoﬀfrom the option is
maxð0; ST  SÞ þ ðS  KÞ
where, as usual, K is the strike price and ST is the asset price at time T. The value at
time  if the holder shouts is therefore the present value of S  K (received at time T)
plus the value of a European option with strike price S. The latter can be calculated
using Black–Scholes–Merton formulas.
A shout option is valued by constructing a binomial or trinomial tree for the under-
lying asset in the usual way. Working back through the tree, the value of the option if the
holder shouts and the value if the holder does not shout can be calculated at each node.
The option’s price at the node is the greater of the two. The procedure for valuing a shout
option is therefore similar to the procedure for valuing a regular American option.
26.13
ASIAN OPTIONS
Asian options are options where the payoﬀdepends on the arithmetic average of the
price of the underlying asset during the life of the option. The payoﬀfrom an average
price call is maxð0; Save  KÞ and that from an average price put is maxð0; K  SaveÞ,
where Save is the average price of the underlying asset. Average price options are less

Options,’’ Finance and Stochastics, 2 (1998): 1–28.

expensive than regular options and are arguably more appropriate than regular options
for meeting some of the needs of corporate treasurers. Suppose that a US corporate
treasurer expects to receive a cash ﬂow of 100 million Australian dollars spread evenly
over the next year from the company’s Australian subsidiary. The treasurer is likely to
be interested in an option that guarantees that the average exchange rate realized during
the year is above some level. An average price put option can achieve this more
eﬀectively than regular put options.
Average price options can be valued using similar formulas to those used for regular
options if it is assumed that Save is lognomal. As it happens, when the usual assumption
is made for the process followed by the asset price, this is a reasonable assumption.10
A popular approach is to ﬁt a lognormal distribution to the ﬁrst two moments of Save
and use Black’s model.11 Suppose that M1 and M2 are the ﬁrst two moments of Save.
The value of average price calls and puts are given by equations (18.9) and (18.10), with

Consider a newly issued average price call option on a non-dividend-paying stock
where the stock price is 50, the strike price is 50, the stock price volatility is 40%
per annum, the risk-free rate is 10% per annum, and the time to maturity is 1 year.
In this case, S0 ¼ 50, K ¼ 50, r ¼ 0:1, q ¼ 0,  ¼ 0:4, and T ¼ 1. If the average is
calculated continuously, M1 ¼ 52:59 and M2 ¼ 2,922:76. From equations (26.3)
and (26.4), F0 ¼ 52:59 and  ¼ 23:54%. Equation (18.9), with K ¼ 50, T ¼ 1, and
r ¼ 0:1, gives the value of the option as 5.62. When 12, 52, and 250 observations
are used for the average, the price is 6.00, 5.70, and 5.63, respectively.
10 When the asset price follows geometric Brownian motion, the geometric average of the price is exactly
lognormal and the arithmetic average is approximately lognormal.

issued and some prices used to determine the average have already been observed.
Suppose that the averaging period is composed of a period of length t1 over which
prices have already been observed and a future period of length t2 (the remaining life of
the option). Suppose that the average asset price during the ﬁrst time period is S. The
payoﬀfrom an average price call is
max
 St1 þ Savet2
t1 þ t2
 K; 0

where Save is the average asset price during the remaining part of the averaging period.
This is the same as
t2
t1 þ t2
maxðSave  K; 0Þ
where
K ¼ t1 þ t2
t2
K  t1

S
When K > 0, the option can be valued in the same way as a newly issued Asian option
provided that we change the strike price from K to K and multiply the result by
t2=ðt1 þ t2Þ. When K < 0 the option is certain to be exercised and can be valued as a
forward contract. The value is
t2
t1 þ t2
½M1ert2  Kert2
Another type of Asian option is an average strike option. An average strike call pays oﬀ
maxð0; ST  SaveÞ and an average strike put pays oﬀmaxð0; Save  STÞ. Average strike
options can guarantee that the average price paid for an asset in frequent trading over a
period of time is not greater than the ﬁnal price. Alternatively, it can guarantee that the
average price received for an asset in frequent trading over a period of time is not less
than the ﬁnal price. It can be valued as an option to exchange one asset for another
when Save is assumed to be lognormal.

OPTIONS TO EXCHANGE ONE ASSET FOR ANOTHER
Options to exchange one asset for another (sometimes referred to as exchange options)
arise in various contexts. An option to buy yen with Australian dollars is, from the
point of view of a US investor, an option to exchange one foreign currency asset for
another foreign currency asset. A stock tender oﬀer is an option to exchange shares in
one stock for shares in another stock.
Consider a European option to give up an asset worth UT at time T and receive in
return an asset worth VT. The payoﬀfrom the option is
maxðVT  UT; 0Þ
A formula for valuing this option was ﬁrst produced by Margrabe.12 Suppose that the

(March 1978): 177–86.

asset prices, U and V, both follow geometric Brownian motion with volatilities U and
V. Suppose further that the instantaneous correlation between U and V is , and the
yields provided by U and V are qU and qV, respectively. The value of the option at time
zero is
V0eqV TNðd1Þ  U0eqUTNðd2Þ

q
and U0 and V0 are the values of U and V at times zero.
This result will be proved in Chapter 28. It is interesting to note that equation (26.5)
is independent of the risk-free rate r. This is because, as r increases, the growth rate of
both asset prices in a risk-neutral world increases, but this is exactly oﬀset by an
increase in the discount rate. The variable ^ is the volatility of V=U. Comparisons with
equation (17.4) show that the option price is the same as the price of U0 European call
options on an asset worth V=U when the strike price is 1.0, the risk-free interest rate is
qU, and the dividend yield on the asset is qV. Mark Rubinstein shows that the American
version of this option can be characterized similarly for valuation purposes.13 It can be
regarded as U0 American options to buy an asset worth V=U for 1.0 when the risk-free
interest rate is qU and the dividend yield on the asset is qV. The option can therefore be
valued as described in Chapter 21 using a binomial tree.
An option to obtain the better or worse of two assets can be regarded as a position in
one of the assets combined with an option to exchange it for the other asset:
minðUT; VTÞ ¼ VT  maxðVT  UT; 0Þ
maxðUT; VTÞ ¼ UT þ maxðVT  UT; 0Þ
26.15
OPTIONS INVOLVING SEVERAL ASSETS
Options involving two or more risky assets are sometimes referred to as rainbow options.
One example is the bond futures contract traded on the CBOT described in Chapter 6.
The party with the short position is allowed to choose between a large number of
diﬀerent bonds when making delivery.
Probably the most popular option involving several assets is a European basket
option. This is an option where the payoﬀis dependent on the value of a portfolio
(or basket) of assets. The assets are usually either individual stocks or stock indices or
currencies. A European basket option can be valued with Monte Carlo simulation, by
assuming that the assets follow correlated geometric Brownian motion processes. A
much faster approach is to calculate the ﬁrst two moments of the basket at the maturity
of the option in a risk-neutral world, and then assume that value of the basket is

VOLATILITY AND VARIANCE SWAPS
A volatility swap is an agreement to exchange the realized volatility of an asset between
time 0 and time T for a prespecifed ﬁxed volatility. The realized volatility is usually
calculated as described in Section 15.4 but with the assumption that the mean daily
return is zero. Suppose that there are n daily observations on the asset price during the
period between time 0 and time T. The realized volatility is
 ¼

where Si is the ith observation on the asset price. (Sometimes n  1 might replace n  2
in this formula.)
The payoﬀfrom the volatility swap at time T to the payer of the ﬁxed volatility is
Lvolð   KÞ, where Lvol is the notional principal and K is the ﬁxed volatility. Whereas
an option provides a complex exposure to the asset price and volatility, a volatility swap
is simpler in that it has exposure only to volatility.
A variance swap is an agreement to exchange the realized variance rate V between
time 0 and time T for a prespeciﬁed variance rate. The variance rate is the square of
the volatility ( V ¼ 2). Variance swaps are easier to value than volatility swaps. This is
because the variance rate between time 0 and time T can be replicated using a
portfolio of put and call options. The payoﬀfrom a variance swap at time T to
the payer of the ﬁxed variance rate is Lvarð V  VKÞ, where Lvar is the notional
principal and VK is the ﬁxed variance rate. Often the notional principal for a variance
swap is expressed in terms of the corresponding notional principal for a volatility swap
using Lvar ¼ Lvol=ð2KÞ.

This provides a way of valuing a variance swap.14 The value of an agreement to

The function QðKiÞ is the price of a European put option with strike price Ki if Ki < S 
and the price of a European call option with strike price Ki if Ki > S . When Ki ¼ S ,
the function QðKiÞ is equal to the average of the prices of a European call and a
European put with strike price Ki.
Example 26.4
Consider a 3-month contract to receive the realized variance rate of an index over
the 3 months and pay a variance rate of 0.045 on a principal of $100 million. The
risk-free rate is 4% and the dividend yield on the index is 1%. The current level of
the index is 1020. Suppose that, for strike prices of 800, 850, 900, 950, 1,000,
1,050, 1,100, 1,150, 1,200, the 3-month implied volatilities of the index are 29%,

trade in the market and have maturities immediately above and below 30 days. The
30-day risk-neutral expected cumulative variance is calculated from these two numbers
using interpolation. This is then multiplied by 365/30 and the index is set equal to the
square root of the result. More details on the calculation can be found on:

STATIC OPTIONS REPLICATION
If the procedures described in Chapter 19 are used for hedging exotic options, some are
easy to handle, but others are very diﬃcult because of discontinuities (see Business
Snapshot 26.1). For the diﬃcult cases, a technique known as static options replication is
sometimes useful.15 This involves searching for a portfolio of actively traded options that
approximately replicates the exotic option. Shorting this position provides the hedge.16
The basic principle underlying static options replication is as follows. If two portfolios
are worth the same on a certain boundary, they are also worth the same at all interior
points of the boundary. Consider as an example a 9-month up-and-out call option on a
non-dividend-paying stock where the stock price is 50, the strike price is 50, the barrier is
60, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and the volatility is 30% per annum.
Suppose that fðS; tÞ is the value of the option at time t for a stock price of S. Any
boundary in ðS; tÞ space can be used for the purposes of producing the replicating
portfolio. A convenient one to choose is shown in Figure 26.1. It is deﬁned by S ¼ 60
and t ¼ 0:75. The values of the up-and-out option on the boundary are given by
fðS; 0:75Þ ¼ maxðS  50; 0Þ
when S < 60
fð60; tÞ ¼ 0
when 0 6 t 6 0:75
There are many ways that these boundary values can be approximately matched
using regular options. The natural option to match the ﬁrst boundary is a 9-month
European call with a strike price of 50. The ﬁrst component of the replicating portfolio
is therefore one unit of this option. (We refer to this option as option A.)
One way of matching the fð60; tÞ boundary is to proceed as follows:
1. Divide the life of the option into N steps of length t
2. Choose a European call option with a strike price of 60 and maturity at time Nt
(¼ 9 months) to match the boundary at the f60; ðN  1Þtg point
3. Choose a European call option with a strike price of 60 and maturity at
time ðN  1Þt to match the boundary at the f60; ðN  2Þtg point
and so on. Note that the options are chosen in sequence so that they have zero value on
the parts of the boundary matched by earlier options.17 The option with a strike price
15 See E. Derman, D. Ergener, and I. Kani, ‘‘Static Options Replication,’’ Journal of Derivatives 2, 4
(Summer 1995): 78–95.
16 Technical Note 22 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes provides an example of static
replication. It shows that the variance rate of an asset can be replicated by a position in the asset and out-of-the-
money options on the asset. This result, which leads to equation (26.6), can be used to hedge variance swaps.
17 This is not a requirement. If K points on the boundary are to be matched, we can choose K options and
solve a set of K linear equations to determine required positions in the options.

of 60 that matures in 9 months has zero value on the vertical boundary that is matched
by option A. The option maturing at time i t has zero value at the point f60; i tg that
is matched by the option maturing at time ði þ 1Þt for 1 6 i 6 N  1.
Suppose that t ¼ 0:25. In addition to option A, the replicating portfolio consists of
positions in European options with strike price 60 that mature in 9, 6, and 3 months.
We will refer to these as options B, C, and D, respectively. Given our assumptions
Business Snapshot 26.1
Is Delta Hedging Easier or More Diﬃcult
for Exotics?
As described in Chapter 19, we can approach the hedging of exotic options by
creating a delta neutral position and rebalancing frequently to maintain delta
neutrality. When we do this we ﬁnd some exotic options are easier to hedge than
plain vanilla options and some are more diﬃcult.
An example of an exotic option that is relatively easy to hedge is an average price
option where the averaging period is the whole life of the option. As time passes, we
observe more of the asset prices that will be used in calculating the ﬁnal average. This
means that our uncertainty about the payoﬀdecreases with the passage of time. As a
result, the option becomes progressively easier to hedge. In the ﬁnal few days, the
delta of the option always approaches zero because price movements during this time
have very little impact on the payoﬀ.
By contrast barrier options are relatively diﬃcult to hedge. Consider a down-and-
out call option on a currency when the exchange rate is 0:0005 above the barrier. If
the barrier is hit, the option is worth nothing. If the barrier is not hit, the option may
prove to be quite valuable. The delta of the option is discontinuous at the barrier
making conventional hedging very diﬃcult.

about volatility and interest rates, option B is worth 4.33 at the f60; 0:5g point.
Option A is worth 11.54 at this point. The position in option B necessary to match
the boundary at the f60; 0:5g point is therefore 11:54=4:33 ¼ 2:66. Option C is worth
4.33 at the f60; 0:25g point. The position taken in options A and B is worth 4:21 at
this point. The position in option C necessary to match the boundary at the f60; 0:25g
point is therefore 4:21=4:33 ¼ 0:97. Similar calculations show that the position in
option D necessary to match the boundary at the f60; 0g point is 0.28.
The portfolio chosen is summarized in Table 26.1. (See also Sample Application F of
the DerivaGem Applications.) It is worth 0.73 initially (i.e., at time zero when the stock
price is 50). This compares with 0.31 given by the analytic formula for the up-and-out
call earlier in this chapter. The replicating portfolio is not exactly the same as the up-
and-out option because it matches the latter at only three points on the second
boundary. If we use the same procedure, but match at 18 points on the second
boundary (using options that mature every half month), the value of the replicating
portfolio reduces to 0.38. If 100 points are matched, the value reduces further to 0.32.
To hedge a derivative, the portfolio that replicates its boundary conditions must be
shorted. The portfolio must be unwound when any part of the boundary is reached.
Static options replication has the advantage over delta hedging that it does not
require frequent rebalancing. It can be used for a wide range of derivatives. The user
has a great deal of ﬂexibility in choosing the boundary that is to be matched and the
options that are to be used.
SUMMARY
Exotic options are options with rules governing the payoﬀthat are more complicated
than standard options. We have discussed 15 diﬀerent types of exotic options: packages,
perpetual American options, nonstandard American options, gap options, forward start
options, cliquet options, compound options, chooser options, barrier options, binary
options, lookback options, shout options, Asian options, options to exchange one asset
for another, and options involving several assets. We have discussed how these can be
valued using the same assumptions as those used to derive the Black–Scholes–Merton
model in Chapter 15. Some can be valued analytically, but using much more complicated
formulas than those for regular European calls and puts, some can be handled using
analytic approximations, and some can be valued using extensions of the numerical
procedures in Chapter 21. We will present more numerical procedures for valuing exotic
options in Chapter 27.

CHAPTER 26

Some exotic options are easier to hedge than the corresponding regular options;
others are more diﬃcult. In general, Asian options are easier to hedge because the
payoﬀbecomes progressively more certain as we approach maturity. Barrier options can
be more diﬃcult to hedge because delta is discontinuous at the barrier. One approach
to hedging an exotic option, known as static options replication, is to ﬁnd a portfolio of
regular options whose value matches the value of the exotic option on some boundary.
The exotic option is hedged by shorting this portfolio.

More on Models
and Numerical
Procedures
Up to now the models we have used to value options have been based on the geometric
Brownian motion model of asset price behavior that underlies the Black–Scholes–
Merton formulas and the numerical procedures we have used have been relatively
straightforward. In this chapter we introduce a number of new models and explain
how the numerical procedures can be adapted to cope with particular situations.
Chapter 20 explained how traders overcome the weaknesses in the geometric Brown-
ian motion model by using volatility surfaces. A volatility surface determines an
appropriate volatility to substitute into Black–Scholes–Merton when pricing plain
vanilla options. Unfortunately it says little about the volatility that should be used
for exotic options when the pricing formulas of Chapter 26 are used. Suppose the
volatility surface shows that the correct volatility to use when pricing a one-year plain
vanilla option with a strike price of $40 is 27%. This is liable to be totally inappropriate
for pricing a barrier option (or some other exotic option) that has a strike price of $40
and a life of one year.
The ﬁrst part of this chapter discusses a number of alternatives to geometric
Brownian motion that are designed to deal with the problem of pricing exotic options
consistently with plain vanilla options. These alternative asset price processes ﬁt the
market prices of plain vanilla options better than geometric Brownian motion. As a
result, we can have more conﬁdence in using them to value exotic options.
The second part of the chapter extends the discussion of numerical procedures. It
explains how convertible bonds and some types of path-dependent derivatives can be
valued using trees. It discusses the special problems associated with valuing barrier
options numerically and how these problems can be handled. Finally, it outlines
alternative ways of constructing trees for two correlated variables and shows how
Monte Carlo simulation can be used to value derivatives when there are early exercise
opportunities.
As in earlier chapters, results are presented for derivatives dependent on an asset
providing a yield at rate q. For an option on a stock index, q should be set equal to the
dividend yield on the index; for an option on a currency, it should be set equal to the
foreign risk-free rate; for an option on a futures contract, it should be set equal to the
domestic risk-free rate.

27.1
ALTERNATIVES TO BLACK–SCHOLES–MERTON
The Black–Scholes–Merton model assumes that an asset’s price changes continously in
a way that produces a lognormal distribution for the price at any future time. There are
many alternative processes that can be assumed. One possibility is to retain the property
that the asset price changes continuously, but assume a process other than geometric
Brownian motion. Another alternative is to overlay continuous asset price changes with
jumps. Yet another alternative is to assume a process where all the asset price changes
that take place are jumps. We will consider examples of all three types of processes in
this section. In particular, we will consider the constant elasticity of variance model,
Merton’s mixed jump–diﬀusion model, and the variance-gamma model. All three
models are implemented in DerivaGem version 3.00. The types of processes we consider
in this section are known collectively as Levy processes.1
The Constant Elasticity of Variance Model
One alternative to Black–Scholes–Merton is the constant elasticity of variance (CEV)
model. This is a diﬀusion model where the risk-neutral process for a stock price S is
dS ¼ ðr  qÞS dt þ S  dz
where r is the risk-free rate, q is the dividend yield, dz is a Wiener process,  is a
volatility parameter, and  is a positive constant.2
When  ¼ 1, the CEV model is the geometric Brownian motion model we have been
using up to now. When  < 1, the volatility increases as the stock price decreases. This
creates a probability distribution similar to that observed for equities with a heavy left
tail and less heavy right tail (see Figure 20.4).3 When  > 1, the volatility increases as
the stock price increases. This creates a probability distribution with a heavy right tail
and a less heavy left tail. This corresponds to a volatility smile where the implied
volatility is an increasing function of the strike price. This type of volatility smile is
sometimes observed for options on futures.
The valuation formulas for European call and put options under the CEV model are
c ¼ S0eqT½1  2ða; b þ 2; cÞ  KerT2ðc; b; aÞ
p ¼ KerT½1  2ðc; b; aÞ  S0eqT2ða; b þ 2; cÞ
when 0 <  < 1, and
c ¼ S0eqT½1  2ðc; b; aÞ  KerT2ða; 2  b; cÞ
p ¼ KerT½1  2ða; 2  b; cÞ  S0eqT2ðc; b; aÞ
1 Roughly speaking, a Levy process is a continuous-time stochastic process with stationary independent
increments.
2 See J. C. Cox and S. A. Ross, ‘‘The Valuation of Options for Alternative Stochastic Processes,’’ Journal of
Financial Economics, 3 (March 1976): 145–66.
3 The reason is as follows. As the stock price decreases, the volatility increases making even lower stock price
more likely; when the stock price increases, the volatility decreases making higher stock prices less likely.

The CEV model is useful for valuing exotic equity options. The parameters of the
model can be chosen to ﬁt the prices of plain vanilla options as closely as possible by
minimizing the sum of the squared diﬀerences between model prices and market
prices.
Merton’s Mixed Jump–Diffusion Model
Merton has suggested a model where jumps are combined with continuous changes.4
Deﬁne:
: Average number of jumps per year
k: Average jump size, measured as a percentage of the asset price
The percentage jump size is assumed to be drawn from a probability distribution in the
model.
The probability of a jump in time t is  t. The average growth rate in the asset
price from the jumps is therefore k. The risk-neutral process for the asset price is
dS
S ¼ ðr  q  kÞ dt þ  dz þ dp
where dz is a Wiener process, dp is the Poisson process generating the jumps, and  is
the volatility of the geometric Brownian motion. The processes dz and dp are assumed
to be independent.
An important particular case of Merton’s model is where the logarithm of one plus
the size of the percentage jump is normal. Assume that the standard deviation of the
normal distribution is s. Merton shows that a European option price can then be written
X

n¼0

where 0 ¼ ð1 þ kÞ. The variable fn is the Black–Scholes–Merton option price when the

and the risk-free rate is
r  k þ n
T
where  ¼ lnð1 þ kÞ.
This model gives rise to heavier left and heavier right tails than Black–Scholes–
Merton. It can be used for pricing currency options. As in the case of the CEV model,
the model parameters are chosen by minimizing the sum of the squared diﬀerences
between model prices and market prices.
Models such as Merton’s that involve jumps can be implemented with Monte Carlo
simulation. When jumps are generated by a Poisson process, the probability of exactly
m jumps in time t is
etðtÞm
m!
where  is the average number of jumps per year. Equivalently, t is the average number
of jumps in time t.
Suppose that on average 0.5 jumps happen per year. The probability of m jumps in
2 years is
e0:52ð0:5  2Þm
m!
Table 27.1 gives the probability and cumulative probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
jumps in 2 years. (The numbers in a table such as this can be calculated using the
POISSON function in Excel.)
To simulate a process following jumps over 2 years, it is necessary to determine on
each simulation trial:
1. The number of jumps
2. The size of each jump.
To determine the number of jumps, on each simulation trial we sample a random
number between 0 and 1 and use Table 27.1 as a look-up table. If the random number
is between 0 and 0.3679, no jumps occur; if the random number is between 0.3679 and
0.7358, one jump occurs; if the random number is between 0.7358 and 0.9197, two jumps

occur; and so on. To determine the size of each jump, it is necessary on each simulation
trial to sample from the probability distribution for the jump size once for each jump
that occurs. Once the number of jumps and the jump sizes have been determined, the
ﬁnal value of the variable being simulated is known for the simulation trial.
In Merton’s mixed jump–diﬀusion model, jumps are superimposed upon the usual
lognormal diﬀusion process that is assumed for stock prices. The process then has two
components (the usual diﬀusion component and the jump component) and each must
be sampled separately. The diﬀusion component is sampled as described in Sections 21.6
and 21.7 while the jump component is sampled as just described. When derivatives are
valued, it is important to ensure that the overall expected return from the asset (from
both components) is the risk-free rate. This means that the drift for the diﬀusion
component in Merton’s model is r  q  k.
The Variance-Gamma Model
An example of a pure jump model that is proving quite popular is the variance-gamma
model.5 Deﬁne a variable g as the change over time T in a variable that follows a
gamma process with mean rate of 1 and variance rate of v. A gamma process is a pure
jump process where small jumps occur very frequently and large jumps occur only
occasionally. The probability density for g is
gT=v1eg=v
vT=vðT=vÞ
where ð  Þ denotes the gamma function. This probability density can be computed in
Excel using the GAMMADISTð ; ; ;  Þ function. The ﬁrst argument of the function is
g, the second is T=v, the third is v, and the fourth is TRUE or FALSE, where TRUE
returns the cumulative probability distribution function and FALSE returns the prob-
ability density function we have just given.
As usual, we deﬁne ST as the asset price at time T, S0 as the asset price today, r as the
risk-free interest rate, and q as the dividend yield. In a risk-neutral world ln ST, under
the variance-gamma model, has a probability distribution that, conditional on g, is
normal. The conditional mean is
ln S0 þ ðr  qÞT þ ! þ g
and the conditional standard deviation is

ﬃﬃﬃg
p
where
! ¼ ðT=vÞ lnð1  v  2v=2Þ
The variance-gamma model has three parameters: v, , and .6 The parameter v is the
variance rate of the gamma process,  is the volatility, and  is a parameter deﬁning
skewness. When  ¼ 0, ln ST is symmetric; when  < 0, it is negatively skewed (as for
equities); and when  > 0, it is positively skewed.
5 See D. B. Madan, P. P. Carr, and E. C. Chang, ‘‘The Variance-Gamma Process and Option Pricing,’’
European Finance Review, 2 (1998): 79–105.
6 Note that all these parameters are liable to change when we move from the real world to the risk-neutral
world. This is in contrast to pure diﬀusion models where the volatility remains the same.

CHAPTER 27

Suppose that we are interested in using Excel to obtain 10,000 random samples of the
change in an asset price between time 0 and time T using the variance-gamma model.
As a preliminary, we could set cells E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, and E7 equal to T, v, , , r,
q, and S0, respectively. We could also set E8 equal to ! by deﬁning it as
¼ $E$1  LNð1  $E$3  $E$2  $E$4  $E$4  $E$2=2Þ=$E$2
We could then proceed as follows:
1. Sample values for g using the GAMMAINV function. Set the contents of cells
A1, A2, . . . , A10000 as
¼ GAMMAINVðRANDðÞ; $E$1=$E$2; $E$2Þ
2. For each value of g we sample a value z for a variable that is normally distributed
with mean g and standard deviation 
ﬃﬃﬃg

Figure 27.1 shows the probability distribution that is obtained using the variance-
gamma model for ST
when S0 ¼ 100, T ¼ 0:5, v ¼ 0:5,  ¼ 0:1,  ¼ 0:2, and
r ¼ q ¼ 0. For comparison it also shows the distribution given by geometric Brownian
motion when the volatility,  is 0.2 (or 20%). Although not clear in Figure 27.1, the
variance-gamma distribution has heavier tails than the lognormal distribution given by
geometric Brownian motion.
One way of characterizing the variance-gamma distribution is that g deﬁnes the rate
at which information arrives during time T. If g is large, a great deal of information
arrives and the sample we take from a normal distribution in step 2 above has a
relatively large mean and variance. If g is small, relatively little information arrives
and the sample we take has a relatively small mean and variance. The parameter T is the
usual time measure, and g is sometimes referred to as measuring economic time or time
adjusted for the ﬂow of information.
Semi-analytic European option valuation formulas are provided by Madan et al.
(1998). The variance-gamma model tends to produce a U-shaped volatility smile. The
smile is not necessarily symmetrical. It is very pronounced for short maturities and ‘‘dies
away’’ for long maturities. The model can be ﬁtted to either equity or foreign currency
plain vanilla option prices.
27.2
STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODELS
The Black–Scholes–Merton model assumes that volatility is constant. In practice, as
discussed in Chapter 23, volatility varies through time. The variance-gamma model
reﬂects this with its g variable. Low values of g correspond to a low arrival rate for
information and a low volatility; high values of g correspond to a high arrival rate for
information and a high volatility.
An alternative to the variance-gamma model is a model where the process followed
by the volatility variable is speciﬁed explicitly. Suppose ﬁrst that the volatility parameter
in the geometric Brownian motion is a known function of time. The risk-neutral process
followed by the asset price is then
dS ¼ ðr  qÞS dt þ ðtÞS dz
ð27:1Þ
The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas are then correct provided that the variance rate is
set equal to the average variance rate during the life of the option (see Problem 27.6).
The variance rate is the square of the volatility. Suppose that during a 1-year period the
volatility of a stock will be 20% during the ﬁrst 6 months and 30% during the second

Equation (27.1) assumes that the instantaneous volatility of an asset is perfectly
predictable. In practice, volatility varies stochastically. This has led to the develop-
ment of more complex models with two stochastic variables: the stock price and its
volatility.

where a, VL, , and  are constants, and dzS and dzV are Wiener processes. The variable V
in this model is the asset’s variance rate. The variance rate has a drift that pulls it back to
a level VL at rate a.
Hull and White show that, when volatility is stochastic but uncorrelated with the asset
price, the price of a European option is the Black–Scholes–Merton price integrated over
the probability distribution of the average variance rate during the life of the option.7
Thus, a European call price is

where V is the average value of the variance rate, c is the Black–Scholes–Merton price
expressed as a function of V, and g is the probability density function of V in a risk-
neutral world. This result can be used to show that Black–Scholes–Merton overprices
options that are at the money or close to the money, and underprices options that are
deep-in- or deep-out-of-the-money. The model is consistent with the pattern of implied
volatilities observed for currency options (see Section 20.2).
The case where the asset price and volatility are correlated is more complicated.
Option prices can be obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. In the particular case
where  ¼ 0:5, Hull and White provide a series expansion and Heston provides an
analytic result.8 The pattern of implied volatilities obtained when the volatility is
negatively correlated with the asset price is similar to that observed for equities (see
Section 20.3).9

GARCH(1,1) and stochastic volatility models.)
Stochastic volatility models can be ﬁtted to the prices of plain vanilla options and then
used to price exotic options.11 For options that last less than a year, the impact of a
stochastic volatility on pricing is fairly small in absolute terms (although in percentage

terms it can be quite large for deep-out-of-the-money options). It becomes progressively
larger as the life of the option increases. The impact of a stochastic volatility on the
performance of delta hedging is generally quite large. Traders recognize this and, as
described in Chapter 19, monitor their exposure to volatility changes by calculating vega.
27.3
THE IVF MODEL
The parameters of the models we have discussed so far can be chosen so that they
provide an approximate ﬁt to the prices of plain vanilla options on any given day.
Financial institutions sometimes want to go one stage further and use a model that
provides an exact ﬁt to the prices of these options.12 In 1994 Derman and Kani, Dupire,
and Rubinstein developed a model that is designed to do this. It has become known as
the implied volatility function (IVF) model or the implied tree model.13 It provides an
exact ﬁt to the European option prices observed on any given day, regardless of the
shape of the volatility surface.
The risk-neutral process for the asset price in the model has the form
dS ¼ ½rðtÞ  qðtÞS dt þ ðS; tÞS dz
where rðtÞ is the instantaneous forward interest rate for a contract maturing at time t
and qðtÞ is the dividend yield as a function of time. The volatility ðS; tÞ is a function of
both S and t and is chosen so that the model prices all European options consistently
with the market. It is shown both by Dupire and by Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliﬀe
that ðS; tÞ can be calculated analytically:14
½ðK; TÞ2 ¼ 2 @cmkt=@T þ qðTÞcmkt þ K½rðTÞ  qðTÞ@cmkt=@K
K2ð@2cmkt=@K2Þ
ð27:4Þ
where cmktðK; TÞ is the market price of a European call option with strike price K and
maturity T. If a suﬃciently large number of European call prices are available in the
market, this equation can be used to estimate the ðS; tÞ function.15
Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliﬀe implement the model by using equation (27.4)
together with the implicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method. An alternative approach, the implied
tree methodology suggested by Derman and Kani and Rubinstein, involves constructing
a tree for the asset price that is consistent with option prices in the market.
When it is used in practice the IVF model is recalibrated daily to the prices of plain
vanilla options. It is a tool to price exotic options consistently with plain vanilla
options. As discussed in Chapter 20 plain vanilla options deﬁne the risk-neutral
12 There is a practical reason for this. If the bank does not use a model with this property, there is a danger
that traders working for the bank will spend their time arbitraging the bank’s internal models.

probability distribution of the asset price at all future times. It follows that the IVF
model gets the risk-neutral probability distribution of the asset price at all future times
correct. This means that options providing payoﬀs at just one time (e.g., all-or-nothing
and asset-or-nothing options) are priced correctly by the IVF model. However, the
model does not necessarily get the joint distribution of the asset price at two or more
times correct. This means that exotic options such as compound options and barrier
options may be priced incorrectly.16
27.4
CONVERTIBLE BONDS
We now move on to discuss how the numerical procedures presented in Chapter 21 can
be modiﬁed to handle particular valuation problems. We start by considering con-
vertible bonds.
Convertible bonds are bonds issued by a company where the holder has the option to
exchange the bonds for the company’s stock at certain times in the future. The conversion
ratio is the number of shares of stock obtained for one bond (this can be a function of
time). The bonds are almost always callable (i.e., the issuer has the right to buy them back
at certain times at a predetermined prices). The holder always has the right to convert the
bond once it has been called. The call feature is therefore usually a way of forcing
conversion earlier than the holder would otherwise choose. Sometimes the holder’s call
option is conditional on the price of the company’s stock being above a certain level.
Credit risk plays an important role in the valuation of convertibles. If credit risk is
ignored, poor prices are obtained because the coupons and principal payments on the
bond are overvalued. Ingersoll provides a way of valuing convertibles using a model
similar to Merton’s (1974) model discussed in Section 24.6.17 He assumes geometric
Brownian motion for the issuer’s total assets and models the company’s equity, its
convertible debt, and its other debt as claims contingent on the value of the assets.
Credit risk is taken into account because the debt holders get repaid in full only if the
value of the assets exceeds the amount owing to them.
A simpler model that is widely used in practice involves modeling the issuer’s stock
price. It is assumed that the stock follows geometric Brownian motion except that there
is a probability  t that there will be a default in each short period of time t. In the
event of a default the stock price falls to zero and there is a recovery on the bond. The
variable  is the risk-neutral hazard rate deﬁned in Section 24.2.
The stock price process can be represented by varying the usual binomial tree so that
at each node there is:
1. A probability pu of a percentage up movement of size u over the next time period
of length t
16 Hull and Suo test the IVF model by assuming that all derivative prices are determined by a stochastic
volatility model. They found that the model works reasonably well for compound options, but sometimes
gives serious errors for barrier options. See J. C. Hull and W. Suo, ‘‘A Methodology for the Assessment of
Model Risk and its Application to the Implied Volatility Function Model,’’ Journal of Financial and
Quantitative Analysis, 37, 2 (June 2002): 297–318
17 See J. E. Ingersoll, ‘‘A Contingent Claims Valuation of Convertible Securities,’’ Journal of Financial
Economics, 4, (May 1977), 289–322.

2. A probability pd of a percentage down movement of size d over the next time
period of length t
3. A probability  t, or more accurately 1  et, that there will be a default with
the stock price moving to zero over the next time period of length t
Parameter values, chosen to match the ﬁrst two moments of the stock price distribu-
tion, are:

d ¼ 1
u
where a ¼ eðrqÞt, r is the risk-free rate, and q is the dividend yield on the stock.
The life of the tree is set equal to the life of the convertible bond. The value of the
convertible at the ﬁnal nodes of the tree is calculated based on any conversion options
that the holder has at that time. We then roll back through the tree. At nodes where the
terms of the instrument allow conversion we test whether conversion is optimal. We
also test whether the position of the issuer can be improved by calling the bonds. If so,
we assume that the bonds are called and retest whether conversion is optimal. This is
equivalent to setting the value at a node equal to
max½minðQ1; Q2Þ; Q3
where Q1 is the value given by the rollback (assuming that the bond is neither converted
nor called at the node), Q2 is the call price, and Q3 is the value if conversion takes place.
Example 27.1
Consider a 9-month zero-coupon bond issued by company XYZ with a face value
of $100. Suppose that it can be exchanged for two shares of company XYZ’s
stock at any time during the 9 months. Assume also that it is callable for $113 at
any time. The initial stock price is $50, its volatility is 30% per annum, and there
are no dividends. The hazard rate  is 1% per year, and all risk-free rates for all
maturities are 5%. Suppose that in the event of a default the bond is worth $40
(i.e., the recovery rate, as it is usually deﬁned, is 40%).
Figure 27.2 shows the stock price tree that can be used to value the convertible
when there are three time steps (t ¼ 0:25). The upper number at each node is the
stock price; the lower number is the price of the convertible bond. The tree par-
ameters are:
u ¼ e

ð0:090:01Þ0:25
p
¼ 1:1519;
d ¼ 1=u ¼ 0:8681
a ¼ e0:050:25 ¼ 1:0126;
pu ¼ 0:5167;
pd ¼ 0:4808
The probability of a default (i.e., of moving to the lowest nodes on the tree is
1  e0:010:25 ¼ 0:002497. At the three default nodes the stock price is zero and
the bond price is 40.
Consider ﬁrst the ﬁnal nodes. At nodes G and H the bond should be converted
and is worth twice the stock price. At nodes I and J the bond should not be
converted and is worth 100.
Moving back through the tree enables the value to be calculated at earlier
nodes. Consider, for example, node E. The value, if the bond is converted, is
2  50 ¼ $100. If it is not converted, then there is (a) a probability 0.5167 that it
will move to node H, where the bond is worth 115.19, (b) a 0.4808 probability
656
CHAPTER 27

that it will move down to node I, where the bond is worth 100, and (c) a 0.002497
probability that it will default and be worth 40. The value of the bond if it is not
converted is therefore
ð0:5167  115:19 þ 0:4808  100 þ 0:002497  40Þ  e0:050:25 ¼ 106:36
This is more than the value of 100 that it would have if converted. We deduce that
it is not worth converting the bond at node E. Finally, we note that the bond
issuer would not call the bond at node E because this would be oﬀering 113 for a
bond worth 106.36.
As another example consider node B. The value of the bond if it is converted is
2  57:596 ¼ 115:19. If it is not converted a similar calculation to that just given
for node E gives its value as 118.31. The convertible bond holder will therefore
choose not to convert. However, at this stage the bond issuer will call the bond for
113 and the bond holder will then decide that converting is better than being
called. The value of the bond at node B is therefore 115.19. A similar argument is
used to arrive at the value at node D. With no conversion the value is 132.79.
However, the bond is called, forcing conversion and reducing the value at the
node to 132.69.
The value of the convertible is its value at the initial node A, or 106.93.
When interest is paid on the debt, it must be taken into account. At each node, when
valuing the bond on the assumption that it is not converted, the present value of any
interest payable on the bond in the next time step should be included. The risk-neutral
hazard rate  can be estimated from either bond prices or credit default swap spreads.
In a more general implementation, , , and r are functions of time. This can be
handled using a trinomial rather than a binomial tree (see Section 21.4).

One disadvantage of the model we have presented is that the probability of default is
independent of the stock price. This has led some researchers to suggest an implicit
ﬁnite diﬀerence method implementation of the model where the hazard rate  is a
function of the stock price as well as time.18
27.5
PATH-DEPENDENT DERIVATIVES
A path-dependent derivative (or history-dependent derivative) is a derivative where the
payoﬀdepends on the path followed by the price of the underlying asset, not just its
ﬁnal value. Asian options and lookback options are examples of path-dependent
derivatives. As explained in Chapter 26, the payoﬀfrom an Asian option depends on
the average price of the underlying asset; the payoﬀfrom a lookback option depends on
its maximum or minimum price. One approach to valuing path-dependent options
when analytic results are not available is Monte Carlo simulation, as discussed in
Chapter 21. A sample value of the derivative can be calculated by sampling a random
path for the underlying asset in a risk-neutral world, calculating the payoﬀ, and
discounting the payoﬀat the risk-free interest rate. An estimate of the value of the
derivative is found by obtaining many sample values of the derivative in this way and
calculating their mean.
The main problem with Monte Carlo simulation is that the computation time
necessary to achieve the required level of accuracy can be unacceptably high. Also,
American-style path-dependent derivatives (i.e., path-dependent derivatives where one
side has exercise opportunities or other decisions to make) cannot easily be handled. In
this section, we show how the binomial tree methods presented in Chapter 21 can be
extended to cope with some path-dependent derivatives.19 The procedure can handle
American-style path-dependent derivatives and is computationally more eﬃcient than
Monte Carlo simulation for European-style path-dependent derivatives.
For the procedure to work, two conditions must be satisﬁed:
1. The payoﬀfrom the derivative must depend on a single function, F, of the path
followed by the underlying asset.
2. It must be possible to calculate the value of F at time 	 þ t from the value of F
at time 	 and the value of the underlying asset at time 	 þ t.
Illustration Using Lookback Options
As a ﬁrst illustration of the procedure, consider an American ﬂoating lookback put
option on a non-dividend-paying stock.20 If exercised at time 	, this pays oﬀthe amount
by which the maximum stock price between time 0 and time 	 exceeds the current stock
18 See, e.g., L. Andersen and D. Buﬀum, ‘‘Calibration and Implementation of Convertible Bond Models,’’
Journal of Computational Finance, 7, 1 (Winter 2003/04), 1–34. These authors suggest assuming that the
hazard rate is inversely proportional to S , where S is the stock price and  is a positive constant.
19 This approach was suggested in J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘Eﬃcient Procedures for Valuing European and
American Path-Dependent Options,’’ Journal of Derivatives, 1, 1 (Fall 1993): 21–31.
20 This example is used as a ﬁrst illustration of the general procedure for handling path dependence. For a
more eﬃcient approach to valuing American-style lookback options, see Technical Note 13 at:

CHAPTER 27

price. Suppose that the initial stock price is $50, the stock price volatility is 40% per
annum, the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, the total life of the option is three
months, and that stock price movements are represented by a three-step binomial tree.
With our usual notation this means that S0 ¼ 50,  ¼ 0:4, r ¼ 0:10, t ¼ 0:08333,
u ¼ 1:1224, d ¼ 0:8909, a ¼ 1:0084, and p ¼ 0:5073.
The tree is shown in Figure 27.3. In this case, the path function F is the maximum
stock price so far. The top number at each node is the stock price. The next level of
numbers at each node shows the possible maximum stock prices achievable on paths
leading to the node. The ﬁnal level of numbers shows the values of the derivative
corresponding to each of the possible maximum stock prices.
The values of the derivative at the ﬁnal nodes of the tree are calculated as the
maximum stock price minus the actual stock price. To illustrate the rollback procedure,
suppose that we are at node A, where the stock price is $50. The maximum stock price
achieved thus far is either 56.12 or 50. Consider ﬁrst the situation where it is equal to
50. If there is an up movement, the maximum stock price becomes 56.12 and the value
of the derivative is zero. If there is a down movement, the maximum stock price stays at
50 and the value of the derivative is 5.45. Assuming no early exercise, the value of the
derivative at A when the maximum achieved so far is 50 is, therefore,
ð0  0:5073 þ 5:45  0:4927Þe0:10:08333 ¼ 2:66
Clearly, it is not worth exercising at node A in these circumstances because the payoﬀ

659

from doing so is zero. A similar calculation for the situation where the maximum value at
node A is 56.12 gives the value of the derivative at node A, without early exercise, to be
ð0  0:5073 þ 11:57  0:4927Þe0:10:08333 ¼ 5:65
In this case, early exercise gives a value of 6.12 and is the optimal strategy. Rolling
back through the tree in the way we have indicated gives the value of the American
lookback as $5.47.
Generalization
The approach just described is computationally feasible when the number of alternative
values of the path function, F, at each node does not grow too fast as the number of
time steps is increased. The example we used, a lookback option, presents no problems
because the number of alternative values for the maximum asset price at a node in a
binomial tree with n time steps is never greater than n.
Luckily, the approach can be extended to cope with situations where there are a very
large number of diﬀerent possible values of the path function at each node. The basic
idea is as follows. Calculations are carried out at each node for a small number of
representative values of F. When the value of the derivative is required for other values
of the path function, it is calculated from the known values using interpolation.
The ﬁrst stage is to work forward through the tree establishing the maximum and
minimum values of the path function at each node. Assuming the value of the path
function at time 	 þ t depends only on the value of the path function at time 	 and the
value of the underlying variable at time 	 þ t, the maximum and minimum values of
the path function for the nodes at time 	 þ t can be calculated in a straightforward
way from those for the nodes at time 	. The second stage is to choose representative
values of the path function at each node. There are a number of approaches. A simple
rule is to choose the representative values as the maximum value, the minimum value,
and a number of other values that are equally spaced between the maximum and the
minimum. As we roll back through the tree, we value the derivative for each of the
representative values of the path function.
To illustrate the nature of the calculation, consider the problem of valuing the
average price call option in Example 26.3 of Section 26.13 when the payoﬀdepends
on the arithmetic average stock price. The initial stock price is 50, the strike price is 50,
the risk-free interest rate is 10%, the stock price volatility is 40%, and the time to
maturity is 1 year. For 20 time steps, the binomial tree parameters are t ¼ 0:05,
u ¼ 1:0936, d ¼ 0:9144, p ¼ 0:5056, and 1  p ¼ 0:4944. The path function is the
arithmetic average of the stock price.
Figure 27.4 shows the calculations that are carried out in one small part of the tree.
Node X is the central node at time 0.2 year (at the end of the fourth time step). Nodes Y
and Z are the two nodes at time 0.25 year that are reachable from node X. The stock
price at node X is 50. Forward induction shows that the maximum average stock price
that is achievable in reaching node X is 53.83. The minimum is 46.65. (The initial and
ﬁnal stock prices are included when calculating the average.) From node X, the tree
branches to one of the two nodes Y and Z. At node Y, the stock price is 54.68 and the
bounds for the average are 47.99 and 57.39. At node Z, the stock price is 45.72 and the
bounds for the average stock price are 43.88 and 52.48.
660
CHAPTER 27

Suppose that the representative values of the average are chosen to be four equally
spaced values at each node. This means that, at node X, averages of 46.65, 49.04, 51.44,
and 53.83 are considered. At node Y, the averages 47.99, 51.12, 54.26, and 57.39 are
considered. At node Z, the averages 43.88, 46.75, 49.61, and 52.48 are considered.
Assume that backward induction has already been used to calculate the value of the
option for each of the alternative values of the average at nodes Y and Z. Values are
shown in Figure 27.4 (e.g., at node Y when the average is 51.12, the value of the option
is 8.101).
Consider the calculations at node X for the case where the average is 51.44. If the
stock price moves up to node Y, the new average will be
5  51:44 þ 54:68
6
¼ 51:98
The value of the derivative at node Y for this average can be found by interpolating
between the values when the average is 51.12 and when it is 54.26. It is
ð51:98  51:12Þ  8:635 þ ð54:26  51:98Þ  8:101
54:26  51:12
¼ 8:247
Similarly, if the stock price moves down to node Z, the new average will be
5  51:44 þ 45:72
6
¼ 50:49
and by interpolation the value of the derivative is 4.182.
The value of the derivative at node X when the average is 51.44 is, therefore,
ð0:5056  8:247 þ 0:4944  4:182Þe0:10:05 ¼ 6:206
The other values at node X are calculated similarly. Once the values at all nodes at
time 0.2 year have been calculated, the nodes at time 0.15 year can be considered.

The value given by the full tree for the option at time zero is 7.17. As the number of
time steps and the number of averages considered at each node is increased, the value of
the option converges to the correct answer. With 60 time steps and 100 averages at each
node, the value of the option is 5.58. The analytic approximation for the value of the
option, as calculated in Example 26.3, with continuous averaging is 5.62.
A key advantage of the method described here is that it can handle American
options. The calculations are as we have described them except that we test for early
exercise at each node for each of the alternative values of the path function at the
node. (In practice, the early exercise decision is liable to depend on both the value of
the path function and the value of the underlying asset.) Consider the American
version of the average price call considered here. The value calculated using the 20-step
tree and four averages at each node is 7.77; with 60 time steps and 100 averages, the
value is 6.17.
The approach just described can be used in a wide range of diﬀerent situations. The
two conditions that must be satisﬁed were listed at the beginning of this section.
Eﬃciency is improved somewhat if quadratic rather than linear interpolation is used
at each node.
27.6
BARRIER OPTIONS
Chapter 26 presented analytic results for standard barrier options. This section con-
siders numerical procedures that can be used for barrier options when there are no
analytic results.
In principle, many barrier options can be valued using the binomial and trinomial
trees discussed in Chapter 21. Consider an up-and-out option. A simple approach is to
value this in the same way as a regular option except that, when a node above the
barrier is encountered, the value of the option is set equal to zero.
Trinomial trees work better than binomial trees, but even for them convergence is
very slow when the simple approach is used. A large number of time steps are required
to obtain a reasonably accurate result. The reason for this is that the barrier being
assumed by the tree is diﬀerent from the true barrier.21 Deﬁne the inner barrier as the
barrier formed by nodes just on the inside of the true barrier (i.e., closer to the center of
the tree) and the outer barrier as the barrier formed by nodes just outside the true
barrier (i.e., farther away from the center of the tree). Figure 27.5 shows the inner and
outer barrier for a trinomial tree on the assumption that the true barrier is horizontal.
The usual tree calculations implicitly assume that the outer barrier is the true barrier
because the barrier conditions are ﬁrst used at nodes on this barrier. When the time step
is t, the vertical spacing between the nodes is of order
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
. This means that errors
created by the diﬀerence between the true barrier and the outer barrier also tend to be
of order
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t

.
One approach to overcoming this problem is to:
1. Calculate the price of the derivative on the assumption that the inner barrier is the
true barrier.
21 For a discussion of this, see P. P. Boyle and S. H. Lau, ‘‘Bumping Up Against the Barrier with the
Binomial Method,’’ Journal of Derivatives, 1, 4 (Summer 1994): 6–14.
662
CHAPTER 27

2. Calculate the value of the derivative on the assumption that the outer barrier is the
true barrier.
3. Interpolate between the two prices.
Another approach is to ensure that nodes lie on the barrier. Suppose that the initial
stock price is S0 and that the barrier is at H. In a trinomial tree, there are three possible
movements in the asset’s price at each node: up by a proportional amount u; stay the
same; and down by a proportional amount d, where d ¼ 1=u. We can always choose u
so that nodes lie on the barrier. The condition that must be satisﬁed by u is
H ¼ S0uN
or
ln H ¼ ln S0 þ N ln u
for some positive or negative N.
When discussing trinomial trees in Section 21.4, the value suggested for u was e ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

so that ln u ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

. In the situation considered here, a good rule is to choose ln u as
close as possible to this value, consistent with the condition given above. This means
that

This leads to a tree of the form shown in Figure 27.6. The probabilities pu, pm, and

The Adaptive Mesh Model
The methods presented so far work reasonably well when the initial asset price is not
close to the barrier. When the initial asset price is close to a barrier, the adaptive mesh
model, which was introduced in Section 21.4, can be used.22 The idea behind the model
is that computational eﬃciency can be improved by grafting a ﬁne tree onto a coarse
tree to achieve a more detailed modeling of the asset price in the regions of the tree
where it is needed most.

CHAPTER 27

To value a barrier option, it is useful to have a ﬁne tree close to barriers. Figure 27.7
illustrates the design of the tree. The geometry of the tree is arranged so that nodes lie
on the barriers. The probabilities on branches are chosen, as usual, to match the ﬁrst
two moments of the process followed by the underlying asset. The heavy lines in
Figure 27.7 are the branches of the coarse tree. The light solid line are the ﬁne tree.
We ﬁrst roll back through the coarse tree in the usual way. We then calculate the value
at additional nodes using the branches indicated by the dotted lines. Finally we roll
back through the ﬁne tree.
27.7
OPTIONS ON TWO CORRELATED ASSETS
Another tricky numerical problem is that of valuing American options dependent on
two assets whose prices are correlated. A number of alternative approaches have been
suggested. This section will explain three of these.
Transforming Variables
It is relatively easy to construct a tree in three dimensions to represent the movements
of two uncorrelated variables. The procedure is as follows. First, construct a two-
dimensional tree for each variable, and then combine these trees into a single three-

dimensional tree. The probabilities on the branches of the three-dimensional tree are
the product of the corresponding probabilities on the two-dimensional trees. Suppose,
for example, that the variables are stock prices, S1 and S2. Each can be represented in
two dimensions by a Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein binomial tree. Assume that S1 has a
probability p1 of moving up by a proportional amount u1 and a probability 1  p1 of
moving down by a proportional amount d1. Suppose further that S2
has a
probability p2 of moving up by a proportional amount u2 and a probability 1  p2
of moving down by a proportional amount d2. In the three-dimensional tree there are
four branches emanating from each node. The probabilities are:
p1p2: S1 increases; S2 increases
p1ð1  p2Þ: S1 increases; S2 decreases
ð1  p1Þp2: S1 decreases; S2 increases
ð1  p1Þð1  p2Þ: S1 decreases; S2 decreases
Consider next the situation where S1 and S2 are correlated. Suppose that the risk-
neutral processes are:
dS1 ¼ ðr  q1ÞS1 dt þ 1S1 dz1
dS2 ¼ ðr  q2ÞS2 dt þ 2S2 dz2
and the instantaneous correlation between the Wiener processes, dz1 and dz2, is 
. This
means that
d ln S1 ¼ ðr  q1  2
1=2Þ dt þ 1 dz1
d ln S2 ¼ ðr  q2  2
2=2Þ dt þ 2 dz2
Two new uncorrelated variables can be deﬁned:23
x1 ¼ 2 ln S1 þ 1 ln S2
x2 ¼ 2 ln S1  1 ln S2
These variables follow the processes

The variables x1 and x2 can be modeled using two separate binomial trees. In time t,
xi has a probability pi of increasing by hi and a probability 1  pi of decreasing by hi.
The variables hi and pi are chosen so that the tree gives correct values for the ﬁrst two
moments of the distribution of x1 and x2. Because they are uncorrelated, the two trees
can be combined into a single three-dimensional tree, as already described. At each
node of the tree, S1 and S2 can be calculated from x1 and x2 using the inverse

The procedure for rolling back through a three-dimensional tree to value a derivative is
analogous to that for a two-dimensional tree.
Using a Nonrectangular Tree
Rubinstein has suggested a way of building a three-dimensional tree for two correlated
stock prices by using a nonrectangular arrangement of the nodes.24 From a
node ðS1; S2Þ, where the ﬁrst stock price is S1 and the second stock price is S2, there
is a 0.25 chance of moving to each of the following:

When the correlation is zero, this method is equivalent to constructing separate trees for
S1 and S2 using the alternative binomial tree construction method in Section 21.4.
Adjusting the Probabilities
A third approach to building a three-dimensional tree for S1 and S2 involves ﬁrst
assuming no correlation and then adjusting the probabilities at each node to reﬂect the
correlation.25 The alternative binomial tree construction method for each of S1 and S2 in
Section 21.4 is used. This method has the property that all probabilities are 0.5. When the

two binomial trees are combined on the assumption that there is no correlation, the
probabilities are as shown in Table 27.2. When the probabilities are adjusted to reﬂect the
correlation, they become those shown in Table 27.3.
27.8
MONTE CARLO SIMULATION AND AMERICAN OPTIONS
Monte Carlo simulation is well suited to valuing path-dependent options and options
where there are many stochastic variables. Trees and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods are well
suited to valuing American-style options. What happens if an option is both path
dependent and American? What happens if an American option depends on several
stochastic variables? Section 27.5 explained a way in which the binomial tree approach
can be modiﬁed to value path-dependent options in some situations. A number of
researchers have adopted a diﬀerent approach by searching for a way in which Monte
Carlo simulation can be used to value American-style options.26 This section explains
two alternative ways of proceeding.
The Least-Squares Approach
In order to value an American-style option it is necessary to choose between exercising
and continuing at each early exercise point. The value of exercising is normally easy to
determine. A number of researchers including Longstaﬀand Schwartz provide a way of
determining the value of continuing when Monte Carlo simulation is used.27 Their
approach involves using a least-squares analysis to determine the best-ﬁt relationship
between the value of continuing and the values of relevant variables at each time an
early exercise decision has to be made. The approach is best illustrated with a numerical
example. We use the one in the Longstaﬀ–Schwartz paper.
Consider a 3-year American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock that can be
exercised at the end of year 1, the end of year 2, and the end of year 3. The risk-free rate
is 6% per annum (continuously compounded). The current stock price is 1.00 and the
strike price is 1.10. Assume that the eight paths shown in Table 27.4 are sampled for the
stock price. (This example is for illustration only; in practice many more paths would be
sampled.) If the option can be exercised only at the 3-year point, it provides a cash ﬂow
equal to its intrinsic value at that point. This is shown in the last column of Table 27.5.

CHAPTER 27

If the put option is in the money at the 2-year point, the option holder must decide
whether to exercise. Table 27.4 shows that the option is in the money at the 2-year point
for paths 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. For these paths, we assume an approximate relationship:
V ¼ a þ bS þ cS 2
where S is the stock price at the 2-year point and V is the value of continuing,
discounted back to the 2-year point. Our ﬁve observations on S are: 1.08, 1.07, 0.97,
0.77, and 0.84. From Table 27.5 the corresponding values for V are: 0:00, 0:07e0:061,
0:18e0:061, 0:20e0:061, and 0:09e0:061. The values of a, b, and c that minimize

where Si and Vi are the ith observation on S and V, respectively, are a ¼ 1:070,
b ¼ 2:983 and c ¼ 1:813, so that the best-ﬁt relationship is
V ¼ 1:070 þ 2:983S  1:813S 2
This gives the value at the 2-year point of continuing for paths 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 of 0.0369,
0.0461, 0.1176, 0.1520, and 0.1565, respectively. From Table 27.4 the value of exercising

is 0.02, 0.03, 0.13, 0.33, and 0.26. This means that we should exercise at the 2-year point
for paths 4, 6, and 7. Table 27.6 summarizes the cash ﬂows assuming exercise at either
the 2-year point or the 3-year point for the eight paths.
Consider next the paths that are in the money at the 1-year point. These are paths 1,
4, 6, 7, and 8. From Table 27.4 the values of S for the paths are 1.09, 0.93, 0.76, 0.92,
and 0.88, respectively. From Table 27.6, the corresponding continuation values
discounted back to t ¼ 1 are 0:00, 0:13e0:061, 0:33e0:061, 0:26e0:061, and 0:00,
respectively. The least-squares relationship is
V ¼ 2:038  3:335S þ 1:356S 2
This gives the value of continuing at the 1-year point for paths 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 as 0.0139,
0.1092, 0.2866, 0.1175, and 0.1533, respectively. From Table 27.4 the value of exercising
is 0.01, 0.17, 0.34, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively. This means that we should exercise at the
1-year point for paths 4, 6, 7, and 8. Table 27.7 summarizes the cash ﬂows assuming
that early exercise is possible at all three times. The value of the option is determined by
discounting each cash ﬂow back to time zero at the risk-free rate and calculating the
mean of the results. It is

Since this is greater than 0.10, it is not optimal to exercise the option immediately.

CHAPTER 27

This method can be extended in a number of ways. If the option can be exercised at
any time we can approximate its value by considering a large number of exercise points
(just as a binomial tree does). The relationship between V and S can be assumed to be
more complicated. For example we could assume that V is a cubic rather than a
quadratic function of S. The method can be used where the early exercise decision
depends on several state variables. A functional form for the relationship between V
and the variables is assumed and the parameters are estimated using the least-squares
approach, as in the example just considered.
The Exercise Boundary Parameterization Approach
A number of researchers, such as Andersen, have proposed an alternative approach
where the early exercise boundary is parameterized and the optimal values of the
parameters are determined iteratively by starting at the end of the life of the option
and working backward.28 To illustrate the approach, we continue with the put option
example and assume that the eight paths shown in Table 27.4 have been sampled. In
this case, the early exercise boundary at time t can be parameterized by a critical value
of S, S ðtÞ. If the asset price at time t is below S ðtÞ we exercise at time t; if it is above
S ðtÞ we do not exercise at time t. The value of S ð3Þ is 1.10. If the stock price is above
1.10 when t ¼ 3 (the end of the option’s life) we do not exercise; if it is below 1.10 we
exercise. We now consider the determination of S ð2Þ.
Suppose that we choose a value of S ð2Þ less than 0.77. The option is not exercised at
the 2-year point for any of the paths. The value of the option at the 2-year point for the
eight paths is then 0.00, 0.00, 0:07e0:061, 0:18e0:061, 0.00, 0:20e0:061, 0:09e0:061,
and 0.00, respectively. The average of these is 0.0636. Suppose next that S ð2Þ ¼ 0:77.
The value of the option at the 2-year point for the eight paths is then 0.00, 0.00,
0:07e0:061, 0:18e0:061, 0.00, 0.33, 0:09e0:061, and 0.00, respectively. The average
of these is 0.0813. Similarly when S ð2Þ equals 0.84, 0.97, 1.07, and 1.08, the average
value of the option at the 2-year point is 0.1032, 0.0982, 0.0938, and 0.0963, respectively.
This analysis shows that the optimal value of S ð2Þ (i.e., the one that maximizes the
average value of the option) is 0.84. (More precisely, it is optimal to choose
0:84 6 S ð2Þ < 0:97.) When we choose this optimal value for S ð2Þ, the value of the
option at the 2-year point for the eight paths is 0.00, 0.00, 0.0659, 0.1695, 0.00, 0.33, 0.26,
and 0.00, respectively. The average value is 0.1032.
We now move on to calculate S ð1Þ. If S ð1Þ < 0:76 the option is not exercised at the
1-year point for any of the paths and the value at the option at the 1-year point is
0:1032e0:061 ¼ 0:0972. If S ð1Þ ¼ 0:76, the value of the option for each of the eight
paths at the 1-year point is 0.00, 0.00, 0:0659e0:061, 0:1695e0:061, 0.0, 0.34,
0:26e0:061, and 0.00, respectively. The average value of the option is 0.1008. Similarly
when S ð1Þ equals 0.88, 0.92, 0.93, and 1.09 the average value of the option is 0.1283,
0.1202, 0.1215, and 0.1228, respectively. The analysis therefore shows that the optimal
value of S ð1Þ is 0.88. (More precisely, it is optimal to choose 0:88 6 S ð1Þ < 0:92.) The
value of the option at time zero with no early exercise is 0:1283e0:061 ¼ 0:1208. This is
greater than the value of 0.10 obtained by exercising at time zero.
In practice, tens of thousands of simulations are carried out to determine the early
exercise boundary in the way we have described. Once the early exercise boundary has

Market Model,’’ Journal of Computational Finance, 3, 2 (Winter 2000): 1–32.

671

been obtained, the paths for the variables are discarded and a new Monte Carlo
simulation using the early exercise boundary is carried out to value the option. Our
American put option example is simple in that we know that the early exercise
boundary at a time can be deﬁned entirely in terms of the value of the stock price at
that time. In more complicated situations it is necessary to make assumptions about
how the early exercise boundary should be parameterized.
Upper Bounds
The two approaches we have outlined tend to underprice American-style options
because they assume a suboptimal early exercise boundary. This has led Andersen
and Broadie to propose a procedure that provides an upper bound to the price.29 This
procedure can be used in conjunction with any algorithm that generates a lower bound
and pinpoints the true value of an American-style option more precisely than the
algorithm does by itself.
SUMMARY
A number of models have been developed to ﬁt the volatility smiles that are observed in
practice. The constant elasticity of variance model leads to a volatility smile similar to that
observed for equity options. The jump–diﬀusion model leads to a volatility smile similar
to that observed for currency options. Variance-gamma and stochastic volatility models
are more ﬂexible in that they can lead to either the type of volatility smile observed for
equity options or the type of volatility smile observed for currency options. The implied
volatility function model provides even more ﬂexibility than this. It is designed to provide
an exact ﬁt to any pattern of European option prices observed in the market.
The natural technique to use for valuing path-dependent options is Monte Carlo
simulation. This has the disadvantage that it is fairly slow and unable to handle
American-style derivatives easily. Luckily, trees can be used to value many types of
path-dependent derivatives. The approach is to choose representative values for the
underlying path function at each node of the tree and calculate the value of the derivative
for each of these values as we roll back through the tree.
The binomial tree methodology can be extended to value convertible bonds. Extra
branches corresponding to a default by the company are added to the tree. The roll-back
calculations then reﬂect the holder’s option to convert and the issuer’s option to call.
Trees can be used to value many types of barrier options, but the convergence of the
option value to the correct value as the number of time steps is increased tends to be
slow. One approach for improving convergence is to arrange the geometry of the tree so
that nodes always lie on the barriers. Another is to use an interpolation scheme to
adjust for the fact that the barrier being assumed by the tree is diﬀerent from the true
barrier. A third is to design the tree so that it provides a ﬁner representation of
movements in the underlying asset price near the barrier.
One way of valuing options dependent on the prices of two correlated assets is to
apply a transformation to the asset price to create two new uncorrelated variables.

American Options,’’ Management Science, 50, 9 (2004), 1222–34.

CHAPTER 27

These two variables are each modeled with trees and the trees are then combined to
form a single three-dimensional tree. At each node of the tree, the inverse of the
transformation gives the asset prices. A second approach is to arrange the positions
of nodes on the three-dimensional tree to reﬂect the correlation. A third approach is to
start with a tree that assumes no correlation between the variables and then adjust the
probabilities on the tree to reﬂect the correlation.
Monte Carlo simulation is not naturally suited to valuing American-style options, but
there are two ways it can be adapted to handle them. The ﬁrst uses a least-squares analysis
to relate the value of continuing (i.e, not exercising) to the values of relevant variables.
The second involves parameterizing the early exercise boundary and determining it
iteratively by working back from the end of the life of the option to the beginning.

CHAPTER 27

Martingales and
Measures
Up to now interest rates have been assumed to be constant when valuing options. In
this chapter, this assumption is relaxed in preparation for valuing interest rate deriva-
tives in Chapters 29 to 33.
The risk-neutral valuation principle states that a derivative can be valued by (a) cal-
culating the expected payoﬀon the assumption that the expected return from the
underlying asset equals the risk-free interest rate and (b) discounting the expected payoﬀ
at the risk-free interest rate. When interest rates are constant, risk-neutral valuation
provides a well-deﬁned and unambiguous valuation tool. When interest rates are
stochastic, it is less clear-cut. What does it mean to assume that the expected return
on the underlying asset equals to the risk-free rate? Does it mean (a) that each day the
expected return is the one-day risk-free rate, or (b) that each year the expected return is
the 1-year risk-free rate, or (c) that over a 5-year period the expected return is the 5-year
rate at the beginning of the period? What does it mean to discount expected payoﬀs at
the risk-free rate? Can we, for example, discount an expected payoﬀrealized in year 5 at
today’s 5-year risk-free rate?
In this chapter we explain the theoretical underpinnings of risk-neutral valuation
when interest rates are stochastic and show that there are many diﬀerent risk-neutral
worlds that can be assumed in any given situation. We ﬁrst deﬁne a parameter known as
the market price of risk and show that the excess return over the risk-free interest rate
earned by any derivative in a short period of time is linearly related to the market prices
of risk of the underlying stochastic variables. What we will refer to as the traditional
risk-neutral world assumes that all market prices of risk are zero, but we will ﬁnd that
other assumptions about the market price of risk are useful in some situations.
Martingales and measures are critical to a full understanding of risk neutral valua-
tion. A martingale is a zero-drift stochastic process. A measure is the unit in which we
value security prices. A key result in this chapter will be the equivalent martingale
measure result. This states that if we use the price of a traded security as the unit of
measurement then there is a market price of risk for which all security prices follow
martingales.
This chapter illustrates the power of the equivalent martingale measure result by using
it to extend Black’s model (see Section 18.8) to the situation where interest rates are
stochastic and to value options to exchange one asset for another. Chapter 29 uses the
result to understand the standard market models for valuing interest rate derivatives,
677

C H A P T E R

Chapter 30 uses it to value some nonstandard derivatives, and Chapter 32 uses it to
develop the LIBOR market model.
28.1
THE MARKET PRICE OF RISK
We start by considering the properties of derivatives dependent on the value of a single
variable . Assume that the process followed by  is
d
 ¼ m dt þ s dz
ð28:1Þ
where dz is a Wiener process. The parameters m and s are the expected growth rate in 
and the volatility of , respectively. We assume that they depend only on  and time t.
The variable  need not be the price of an investment asset. It could be something as far
removed from ﬁnancial markets as the temperature in the center of New Orleans.
Suppose that f1 and f2 are the prices of two derivatives dependent only on  and t.
These can be options or other instruments that provide a payoﬀequal to some function
of  at some future time. Assume that during the time period under consideration f1
and f2 provide no income.1
Suppose that the processes followed by f1 and f2 are
df1
f1
¼ 1 dt þ 1 dz
and
df2
f2
¼ 2 dt þ 2 dz
where 1, 2, 1, and 2 are functions of  and t. The ‘‘dz’’ in these processes must be
the same dz as in equation (28.1) because it is the only source of the uncertainty in the
prices of f1 and f2.
The prices f1 and f2 can be related using an analysis similar to the Black–Scholes
analysis described in Section 15.6. The discrete versions of the processes for f1 and f2 are
f1 ¼ 1f1 t þ 1f1 z
ð28:2Þ
f2 ¼ 2f2 t þ 2f2 z
ð28:3Þ
We can eliminate the z by forming an instantaneously riskless portfolio consisting of
2f2 of the ﬁrst derivative and 1f1 of the second derivative. If  is the value of the
portfolio, then
 ¼ ð2f2Þf1  ð1f1Þf2
ð28:4Þ
and
 ¼ 2f2 f1  1f1 f2
Substituting from equations (28.2) and (28.3), this becomes
 ¼ ð12f1f2  21f1f2Þt
ð28:5Þ
1 The analysis can be extended to derivatives that provide income (see Problem 28.7).
678
CHAPTER 28

Because the portfolio is instantaneously riskless, it must earn the risk-free rate. Hence,
 ¼ r t
Substituting into this equation from equations (28.4) and (28.5) gives
12  21 ¼ r2  r1
or
1  r
1
¼ 2  r
2
ð28:6Þ
Note that the left-hand side of equation (28.6) depends only on the parameters of the
process followed by f1 and the right-hand side depends only on the parameters of the
process followed by f2. Deﬁne  as the value of each side in equation (28.6), so that
1  r
1
¼ 2  r
2
¼ 
Dropping subscripts, equation (28.6) shows that if f is the price of a derivative dependent
only on  and t with
df
f ¼  dt þ  dz
ð28:7Þ
then
  r

¼ 
ð28:8Þ
The parameter  is known as the market price of risk of . (In the context of portfolio
performance measurement, it is known as the Sharpe ratio.) It can be dependent on
both  and t, but it is not dependent on the nature of the derivative f. Our analysis
shows that, for no arbitrage, ð  rÞ= must at any given time be the same for all
derivatives that are dependent only on  and t.
The market price of risk of  measures the trade-oﬀs between risk and return that are
made for securities dependent on . Equation (28.8) can be written
  r ¼ 
ð28:9Þ
The variable  can be loosely interpreted as the quantity of -risk present in f. On the
right-hand side of the equation, the quantity of -risk is multiplied by the price of
-risk. The left-hand side is the expected return, in excess of the risk-free interest rate,
that is required to compensate for this risk. Equation (28.9) is analogous to the capital
asset pricing model, which relates the expected excess return on a stock to its risk. This
chapter will not be concerned with the measurement of the market price of risk. This
will be discussed in Chapter 35 when the evaluation of real options is considered.
It is natural to assume that , the coeﬃcient of dz, in equation (28.7) is the volatility
of f. In fact,  can be negative. This will be the case when f is negatively related to 
(so that @f=@ is negative). It is the absolute value jj of  that is the volatility of f. One
way of understanding this is to note that the process for f has the same statistical
properties when we replace dz by dz.
Chapter 5 distinguished between investment assets and consumption assets. An
investment asset is an asset that is bought or sold purely for investment purposes by
some investors. Consumption assets are held primarily for consumption. Equation (28.8)
Martingales and Measures
679

is true for all investment assets that provide no income and depend only on . If the
variable  itself happens to be such an asset, then
m  r
s
¼ 
But, in other circumstances, this relationship is not necessarily true.
Example 28.1
Consider a derivative whose price is positively related to the price of oil and
depends on no other stochastic variables. Suppose that it provides an expected
return of 12% per annum and has a volatility of 20% per annum. Assume that the
risk-free interest rate is 8% per annum. It follows that the market price of risk of
oil is
0:12  0:08
0:2
¼ 0:2
Note that oil is a consumption asset rather than an investment asset, so its market
price of risk cannot be calculated from equation (28.8) by setting  equal to the
expected return from an investment in oil and  equal to the volatility of oil prices.
Example 28.2
Consider two securities, both of which are positively dependent on the 90-day
interest rate. Suppose that the ﬁrst one has an expected return of 3% per annum
and a volatility of 20% per annum, and the second one has a volatility of 30% per
annum. Assume that the instantaneous risk-free rate of interest is 6% per annum.
The market price of interest rate risk is, using the expected return and volatility
for the ﬁrst security,
0:03  0:06
0:2
¼ 0:15
From a rearrangement of equation (28.9), the expected return from the second
security is, therefore,
0:06  0:15  0:3 ¼ 0:015
or 1.5% per annum.
Alternative Worlds
The process followed by derivative price f is
df ¼ f dt þ f dz
The value of  depends on the risk preferences of investors. In a world where the
market price of risk is zero,  equals zero. From equation (28.9)  ¼ r, so that the
process followed by f is
df ¼ rf dt þ f dz
We will refer to this as the traditional risk-neutral world.
Other assumptions about the market price of risk, , enable other worlds that are
internally consistent to be deﬁned. From equation (28.9),
 ¼ r þ 
680
CHAPTER 28

so that
df ¼ ðr þ Þf dt þ f dz
ð28:10Þ
The market price of risk of a variable determines the growth rates of all securities
dependent on the variable. As we move from one market price of risk to another, the
expected growth rates of security prices change, but their volatilities remain the same.
This is Girsanov’s theorem, which we illustrated for the binomial model in Section 13.7.
Choosing a particular market price of risk is also referred to as deﬁning the probability
measure. Some value of the market price of risk corresponds to the ‘‘real world’’ and
the growth rates of security prices that are observed in practice.
28.2
SEVERAL STATE VARIABLES
Suppose that n variables, 1, 2, . . . , n, follow stochastic processes of the form
di
i
¼ mi dt þ si dzi
ð28:11Þ
for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, where the dzi are Wiener processes. The parameters mi and si are
expected growth rates and volatilities and may be functions of the i and time.
Equation (14A.10) in the appendix to Chapter 14 provides a version of Itoˆ ’s lemma
that covers functions of several variables. It shows that the process for the price f of a
security that is dependent on the i has n stochastic components. It can be written
df
f ¼  dt þ
X
n
i¼1
i dzi
ð28:12Þ
In this equation,  is the expected return from the security and i dzi is the component
of the risk of this return attributable to i. Both  and the i are potentially dependent
on the i and time.
Technical Note 30 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes shows that
  r ¼
X
n
i¼1
ii
ð28:13Þ
where i is the market price of risk for i. This equation relates the expected excess return
that investors require on the security to the i and i. Equation (28.9) is the particular
case of this equation when n ¼ 1. The term ii on the right-hand side measures the
extent that the excess return required by investors on a security is aﬀected by the
dependence of the security on i. If ii ¼ 0, there is no eﬀect; if ii > 0, investors
require a higher return to compensate them for the risk arising from i; if ii < 0, the
dependence of the security on i causes investors to require a lower return than would
otherwise be the case. The ii < 0 situation occurs when the variable has the eﬀect of
reducing rather than increasing the risks in the portfolio of a typical investor.
Example 28.3
A stock price depends on three underlying variables: the price of oil, the price of
gold, and the performance of a stock index. Suppose that the market prices of risk
for these variables are 0.2, 0:1, and 0.4, respectively. Suppose also that the i in
Martingales and Measures
681

equation (28.12) corresponding to the three variables have been estimated as 0.05,
0.1, and 0.15, respectively. The excess return on the stock over the risk-free rate is
0:2  0:05  0:1  0:1 þ 0:4  0:15 ¼ 0:06
or 6.0% per annum. If variables other than those considered aﬀect the stock
price, this result is still true provided that the market price of risk for each of
these other variables is zero.
Equation (28.13) is closely related to arbitrage pricing theory, developed by Stephen
Ross in 1976.2 The continuous-time version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
can be regarded as a particular case of the equation. CAPM (see appendix to Chapter 3)
argues that an investor requires excess returns to compensate for any risk that is
correlated to the risk in the return from the stock market, but requires no excess return
for other risks. Risks that are correlated with the return from the stock market are
referred to as systematic; other risks are referred to as nonsystematic. If CAPM is true,
then i is proportional to the correlation between changes in i and the return from the
market. When i is uncorrelated with the return from the market, i is zero.
28.3
MARTINGALES
A martingale is a zero-drift stochastic process.3 A variable  follows a martingale if its
process has the form
d ¼  dz
where dz is a Wiener process. The variable  may itself be stochastic. It can depend on 
and other stochastic variables. A martingale has the convenient property that its
expected value at any future time is equal to its value today. This means that
EðTÞ ¼ 0
where 0 and T denote the values of  at times zero and T, respectively. To understand
this result, note that over a very small time interval the change in  is normally
distributed with zero mean. The expected change in  over any very small time interval
is therefore zero. The change in  between time 0 and time T is the sum of its changes
over many small time intervals. It follows that the expected change in  between time 0
and time T must also be zero.
The Equivalent Martingale Measure Result
Suppose that f and g are the prices of traded securities dependent on a single source of
uncertainty. Assume that the securities provide no income during the time period under
consideration and deﬁne  ¼ f=g.4 The variable  is the relative price of f with respect
to g. It can be thought of as measuring the price of f in units of g rather than dollars.
The security price g is referred to as the numeraire.
2 See S. A. Ross, ‘‘The Arbitrage Theory of Capital Asset Pricing,’’ Journal of Economic Theory, 13
(December 1976): 343–62.
3 More formally, a sequence of random variables X0; X1; . . . is a martingale if EðXi j Xi1; Xi2; ; X0Þ ¼ Xi1,
for all i > 0, where E denotes expectation.
4 Problem 28.8 extends the analysis to situations where the securities provide income.
682
CHAPTER 28

The equivalent martingale measure result shows that, when there are no arbitrage
opportunities,  is a martingale for some choice of the market price of risk. What is
more, for a given numeraire security g, the same choice of the market price of risk
makes  a martingale for all securities f. This choice of the market price of risk is the
volatility of g. In other words, when the market price of risk is set equal to the volatility
of g, the ratio f=g is a martingale for all security prices f. (Note that the market price
of risk has the same dimension as volatility. Both are ‘‘per square root of time.’’ Setting
the market price of risk equal to a volatility is therefore dimensionally valid.)
To prove this result, suppose that the volatilities of f and g are f and g. From
equation (28.10), in a world where the market price of risk is g,
df ¼ ðr þ gfÞf dt þ ff dz
dg ¼ ðr þ 2
gÞg dt þ gg dz
Using Itoˆ ’s lemma gives
d ln f ¼ ðr þ gf  2
f=2Þ dt þ f dz
d ln g ¼ ðr þ 2
g=2Þ dt þ g dz
so that
dðln f  ln gÞ ¼ ðgf  2

g=2Þ dt þ ðf  gÞ dz
or
d

Itoˆ ’s lemma can be used to determine the process for f=g from the process for lnðf=gÞ:
d

¼ ðf  gÞ f

ð28:14Þ
This shows that f=g is a martingale and proves the equivalent martingale measure
result. We will refer to a world where the market price of risk is the volatility g of g as a
world that is forward risk neutral with respect to g.
Because f=g is a martingale in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to g,
it follows from the result at the beginning of this section that

28.4
ALTERNATIVE CHOICES FOR THE NUMERAIRE
We now present a number of examples of the equivalent martingale measure result. The
ﬁrst example shows that it is consistent with the traditional risk-neutral valuation result
Martingales and Measures
683

used in earlier chapters. The other examples prepare the way for the valuation of bond
options, interest rate caps, and swap options in Chapter 29.
Money Market Account as the Numeraire
The dollar money market account is a security that is worth $1 at time zero and earns
the instantaneous risk-free rate r at any given time.5 The variable r may be stochastic. If
we set g equal to the money market account, it grows at rate r so that
dg ¼ rg dt
ð28:16Þ
The drift of g is stochastic, but the volatility of g is zero. It follows from the results in
Section 28.3 that f=g is a martingale in a world where the market price of risk is zero.
This is the world we deﬁned earlier as the traditional risk-neutral world. From equa-
tion (28.15),
f0 ¼ g0 ^E fT
gT


ð28:17Þ
where ^E denotes expectations in the traditional risk-neutral world.
In this case, g0 ¼ 1 and
gT ¼ e
Ð T
0 r dt
so that equation (28.17) reduces to
f0 ¼ ^E

eÐ T
0 r dtfT

ð28:18Þ
or
f0 ¼ ^E

er TfT

ð28:19Þ
where r is the average value of r between time 0 and time T. This equation shows that
one way of valuing an interest rate derivative is to simulate the short-term interest rate r
in the traditional risk-neutral world. On each trial the payoﬀis calculated and
discounted at the average value of the short rate on the sampled path.
When the short-term interest rate r is assumed to be constant, equation (28.19)
reduces to
f0 ¼ erT ^EðfTÞ
or the risk-neutral valuation relationship used in earlier chapters.
Zero-Coupon Bond Price as the Numeraire
Deﬁne Pðt; TÞ as the price at time t of a risk-free zero-coupon bond that pays oﬀ$1 at
time T. We now explore the implications of setting g equal to Pðt; TÞ. Let ET denote
expectations in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to Pðt; TÞ. Because
gT ¼ PðT; TÞ ¼ 1 and g0 ¼ Pð0; TÞ, equation (28.15) gives
f0 ¼ Pð0; TÞETðfTÞ
ð28:20Þ
5 The money account is the limit as t approaches zero of the following security. For the ﬁrst short period of
time of length t, it is invested at the initial t period rate; at time t, it is reinvested for a further period of
time t at the new t period rate; at time 2t, it is again reinvested for a further period of time t at the new
t period rate; and so on. The money market accounts in other currencies are deﬁned analogously to the
dollar money market account.
684
CHAPTER 28

Notice the diﬀerence between equations (28.20) and (28.19). In equation (28.19), the
discounting is inside the expectations operator. In equation (28.20) the discounting, as
represented by the Pð0; TÞ term, is outside the expectations operator. The use of Pðt; TÞ
as the numeraire therefore considerably simpliﬁes things for a security that provides a
payoﬀsolely at time T.
Consider any variable  that is not an interest rate.6 A forward contract on  with
maturity T is deﬁned as a contract that pays oﬀT  K at time T, where T is the value 
at time T. Deﬁne f as the value of this forward contract. From equation (28.20),
f0 ¼ Pð0; TÞ½ETðTÞ  K
The forward price, F, of  is the value of K for which f0 equals zero. It therefore
follows that
Pð0; TÞ½ETðTÞ  F ¼ 0
or
F ¼ ETðTÞ
ð28:21Þ
Equation (28.21) shows that the forward price of any variable (except an interest rate) is
its expected future spot price in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to
Pðt; TÞ. Note the diﬀerence here between forward prices and futures prices. The
argument in Section 18.7 shows that the futures price of a variable is the expected
future spot price in the traditional risk-neutral world.
Equation (28.20) shows that any security that provides a payoﬀat time T can be
valued by calculating its expected payoﬀin a world that is forward risk neutral with
respect to a bond maturing at time T and discounting at the risk-free rate for maturity
T. Equation (28.21) shows that it is correct to assume that the expected value of the
underlying variables equal their forward values when computing the expected payoﬀ.
Interest Rates When Zero-Coupon Bond Price is the Numeraire
For the next result, deﬁne Rðt; T; T Þ as the forward interest rate as seen at time t for the
period between T and T  expressed with a compounding period of T   T. (For
example, if T   T ¼ 0:5, the interest rate is expressed with semiannual compounding;
if T   T ¼ 0:25, it is expressed with quarterly compounding; and so on.) The forward
price, as seen at time t, of a zero-coupon bond lasting between times T and T  is
Pðt; T Þ
Pðt; TÞ
A forward interest rate is deﬁned diﬀerently from the forward value of most variables.
A forward risk-free interest rate is the interest rate implied by the prices of risk-free zero-
coupon bonds. The relationship is
1

6 The analysis given here does not apply to interest rates because forward contracts for interest rates are
deﬁned diﬀerently from forward contracts for other variables. A forward interest rate is the interest rate
implied by the corresponding forward bond price.

Setting

that
Rð0; T; T Þ ¼ ET ½RðT; T; T Þ
ð28:22Þ
where ET  denotes expectations in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect
to Pðt; T Þ.
The variable Rð0; T; T Þ is the forward interest rate between times T and T  as seen
at time 0, whereas RðT; T; T Þ is the realized interest rate between times T and T .
Equation (28.22) therefore shows that the forward interest rate between times T and T 
equals the expected future interest rate in a world that is forward risk neutral with
respect to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T . This result, when combined with
that in equation (28.20), will be critical to an understanding of the standard market
model for interest rate caps in the next chapter.
Annuity Factor as the Numeraire
For the next application of equivalent martingale measure arguments, consider a
LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap starting at a future time T with payment dates at times T1,
T2, . . . , TN. In the swap, a ﬁxed rate of interest is exchanged for the LIBOR ﬂoating
rate. Deﬁne T0 ¼ T. Assume that the notional principal is $1. Suppose that the forward
swap rate (i.e., the interest rate on the ﬁxed side that makes the swap have a value of
zero) is sðtÞ at time t (t 6 T). The value of the ﬁxed side of the swap is
sðtÞAðtÞ
where
AðtÞ ¼
X
N1
i¼0
ðTiþ1  TiÞPðt; Tiþ1Þ
Assume that we are using LIBOR discounting. When the principal is added to the
payment on the last payment date of a swap, the value of the ﬂoating side of the swap
on the initiation date equals the underlying principal. (This is because the ﬂoating side
is then a LIBOR ﬂoating rate note and discounting is at LIBOR. It will be recalled that
this type of argument leads to the procedure in Section 7.7 for valuing a swap in terms
of bonds.) It follows that if $1 is added at time TN, the ﬂoating side is worth $1 at time
T0. The value of $1 received at time TN is Pðt; TNÞ. The value of $1 at time T0 is Pðt; T0Þ.
The value of the ﬂoating side at time t is, therefore,
Pðt; T0Þ  Pðt; TNÞ
Equating the values of the ﬁxed and ﬂoating sides gives
sðtÞAðtÞ ¼ Pðt; T0Þ  Pðt; TNÞ
686
CHAPTER 28

or
sðtÞ ¼ Pðt; T0Þ  Pðt; TNÞ
AðtÞ
ð28:23Þ
The equivalent martingale measure result can be applied by setting f equal to
Pðt; T0Þ  Pðt; TNÞ and g equal to AðtÞ. This leads to
sðtÞ ¼ EA½sðTÞ
ð28:24Þ
where EA denotes expectations in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to AðtÞ.
Therefore, in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to AðtÞ, the expected future
swap rate is the current swap rate.
For any security, f, the result in equation (28.15) shows that
f0 ¼ Að0ÞEA

ð28:25Þ
This result, when combined with the result in equation (28.24), will be critical to an
understanding of the standard market model for European swap options in the next
chapter. As we shall see, it can be extended to cover OIS discounting.
28.5
EXTENSION TO SEVERAL FACTORS
The results presented in Sections 28.3 and 28.4 can be extended to cover the situation
when there are many independent factors.7 Assume that there are n independent factors
and that the processes for f and g in the traditional risk-neutral world are
df ¼ rf dt þ

real world.
The deﬁnition of forward risk neutrality can be extended so that a world is forward
risk neutral with respect to g, where i ¼ g;i for all i. It can be shown from Itoˆ ’s
lemma, using the fact that the dzi are uncorrelated, that the process followed by f=g in

this world has zero drift (see Problem 28.12). The rest of the results in the last two
sections (from equation (28.15) onward) are therefore still true.
28.6
BLACK’S MODEL REVISITED
Section 18.8 explained that Black’s model is a popular tool for pricing European
options in terms of the forward or futures price of the underlying asset when interest
rates are constant. We are now in a position to relax the constant interest rate
assumption and show that Black’s model can be used to price European options in
terms of the forward price of the underlying asset when interest rates are stochastic.
Consider a European call option on an asset with strike price K that lasts until time T.
From equation (28.20), the option’s price is given by
c ¼ Pð0; TÞET½maxðST  K; 0Þ
ð28:26Þ
where ST is the asset price at time T and ET denotes expectations in a world that is
forward risk neutral with respect to Pðt; TÞ. Deﬁne F0 and FT as the forward price of
the asset at time 0 and time T for a contract maturing at time T. Because ST ¼ FT,
c ¼ Pð0; TÞET½maxðFT  K; 0Þ
Assume that FT is lognormal in the world being considered, with the standard deviation
of lnðFTÞ equal to F
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

p
. This could be because the forward price follows a stochastic
process with volatility F. Equation(15A.1) shows that

where p is the price of a European put option on the asset with strike price K and time
to maturity T. This is Black’s model. It applies to both investment and consumption
assets and, as we have just shown, is true when interest rates are stochastic provided that
F0 is the forward asset price. The variable F can be interpreted as the volatility of the
forward asset price.

OPTION TO EXCHANGE ONE ASSET FOR ANOTHER
Consider next an option to exchange an investment asset worth U for an investment
asset worth V. This has already been discussed in Section 26.14. Suppose that the
volatilities of U and V are U and V and the coeﬃcient of correlation between them is .

CHANGE OF NUMERAIRE
In this section, we consider the impact of a change in numeraire on the process followed
by a market variable. Suppose ﬁrst that the variable is the price of a traded security, f.

Consider next a variable v that is not the price of a traded security. As shown in
Technical Note 20 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes, the expected
growth rate of v responds to a change in the market price of risk in the same way as the
expected growth rate of the prices of traded securities. It increases by

CHAPTER 28

When we move from a numeraire of g to a numeraire of h, i ¼ g;i and 
i ¼ h;i.
Deﬁne w ¼ h=g and w;i as the ith component of the volatility of w. From Itoˆ ’s
lemma (see Problem 28.13),
w;i ¼ h;i  g;i
so that equation (28.33) becomes
v ¼
X
n
i¼1
w;i v;i
ð28:34Þ
We will refer to w as the numeraire ratio. Equation (28.34) is equivalent to
v ¼ vw
ð28:35Þ
where v is the total volatility of v, w is the total volatility of w, and  is the
instantaneous correlation between changes in v and w.8
This is a surprisingly simple result. The adjustment to the expected growth rate of a
variable v when we change from one numeraire to another is the instantaneous
covariance between the percentage change in v and the percentage change in the
numeraire ratio. This result will be used when timing and quanto adjustments are
considered in Chapter 30.
A particular case of the results in this section is when we move from the real world to
the traditional risk-neutral world (where all the market prices of risk are zero). From
equation (28.33), the growth rate of v changes by  Pn
i¼1 iv;i. This corresponds to the
result in equation (28.13) when v is the price of a traded security. We have shown that it
is also true when v is not the price of a traded security. In general, the way that we move
from one world to another for variables that are not the prices of traded securities is the
same as for those that are.
SUMMARY
The market price of risk of a variable deﬁnes the trade-oﬀs between risk and return for
traded securities dependent on the variable. When there is one underlying variable, a
derivative’s excess return over the risk-free rate equals the market price of risk multiplied
by the derivative’s volatility. When there are many underlying variables, the excess return
is the sum of the market price of risk multiplied by the volatility for each variable.
A powerful tool in the valuation of derivatives is risk-neutral valuation. This was
introduced in Chapters 13 and 15. The principle of risk-neutral valuation shows that, if
we assume that the world is risk neutral when valuing derivatives, we get the right
answer—not just in a risk-neutral world, but in all other worlds as well. In the

traditional risk-neutral world, the market price of risk of all variables is zero. This
chapter has extended the principle of risk-neutral valuation. It has shown that, when
interest rates are stochastic, there are many interesting and useful alternatives to the
traditional risk-neutral world.
A martingale is a zero drift stochastic process. Any variable following a martingale
has the simplifying property that its expected value at any future time equals its value
today. The equivalent martingale measure result shows that, if g is a security price, there
is a world in which the ratio f=g is a martingale for all security prices f. It turns out
that, by appropriately choosing the numeraire security g, the valuation of many interest
rate dependent derivatives can be simpliﬁed.
This chapter has used the equivalent martingale measure result to extend Black’s
model to the situation where interest rates are stochastic and to value an option to
exchange one asset for another. In Chapters 29 to 33, it will be useful in valuing interest
rate derivatives.

CHAPTER 28

Interest Rate
Derivatives:
The Standard
Market Models
Interest rate derivatives are instruments whose payoﬀs are dependent in some way on the
level of interest rates. In the 1980s and 1990s, the volume of trading in interest rate
derivatives in both the over-the-counter and exchange-traded markets increased rapidly.
Many new products were developed to meet particular needs of end users. A key
challenge for derivatives traders was to ﬁnd good, robust procedures for pricing and
hedging these products. Interest rate derivatives are more diﬃcult to value than equity
and foreign exchange derivatives for the following reasons:
1. The behavior of an individual interest rate is more complicated than that of a
stock price or an exchange rate.
2. For the valuation of many products it is necessary to develop a model describing
the behavior of the entire zero-coupon yield curve.
3. The volatilities of diﬀerent points on the yield curve are diﬀerent.
4. Interest rates are used for discounting the derivative as well as deﬁning its payoﬀ.
This chapter considers the three most popular over-the-counter interest rate option
products: bond options, interest rate caps/ﬂoors, and swap options. It explains how
the products work and the standard market models used to value them.
29.1
BOND OPTIONS
A bond option is an option to buy or sell a particular bond by a particular date for a
particular price. In addition to trading in the over-the-counter market, bond options
are frequently embedded in bonds when they are issued to make them more attractive to
either the issuer or potential purchasers.
Embedded Bond Options
One example of a bond with an embedded bond option is a callable bond. This is a
bond that contains provisions allowing the issuing ﬁrm to buy back the bond at a
695
29
C H A P T E R

predetermined price at certain times in the future. The holder of such a bond has sold
a call option to the issuer. The strike price or call price in the option is the
predetermined price that must be paid by the issuer to the holder. Callable bonds
cannot usually be called for the ﬁrst few years of their life. (This is known as the lock-
out period.) After that, the call price is usually a decreasing function of time. For
example, in a 10-year callable bond, there might be no call privileges for the ﬁrst
2 years. After that, the issuer might have the right to buy the bond back at a price of
110 in years 3 and 4 of its life, at a price of 107.5 in years 5 and 6, at a price of 106 in
years 7 and 8, and at a price of 103 in years 9 and 10. The value of the call option is
reﬂected in the quoted yields on bonds. Bonds with call features generally oﬀer higher
yields than bonds with no call features.
Another type of bond with an embedded option is a puttable bond. This contains
provisions that allow the holder to demand early redemption at a predetermined price
at certain times in the future. The holder of such a bond has purchased a put option on
the bond as well as the bond itself. Because the put option increases the value of the
bond to the holder, bonds with put features provide lower yields than bonds with no
put features. A simple example of a puttable bond is a 10-year bond where the holder
has the right to be repaid at the end of 5 years. (This is sometimes referred to as a
retractable bond.)
Loan and deposit instruments also often contain embedded bond options. For
example, a 5-year ﬁxed-rate deposit with a ﬁnancial institution that can be redeemed
without penalty at any time contains an American put option on a bond. (The deposit
instrument is a bond that the investor has the right to put back to the ﬁnancial
institution at its face value at any time.) Prepayment privileges on loans and mortgages
are similarly call options on bonds.
Finally, a loan commitment made by a bank or other ﬁnancial institution is a put
option on a bond. Consider, for example, the situation where a bank quotes a 5-year
interest rate of 5% per annum to a potential borrower and states that the rate is good
for the next 2 months. The client has, in eﬀect, obtained the right to sell a 5-year bond
with a 5% coupon to the ﬁnancial institution for its face value any time within the next
2 months. The option will be exercised if rates increase.
European Bond Options
Many over-the-counter bond options and some embedded bond options are European.
The assumption made in the standard market model for valuing European bond
options is that the forward bond price has a volatility B. This allows Black’s model
in Section 28.6 to be used. In equations (28.28) and (28.29), F is set equal to B and F0
is set equal to the forward bond price FB, so that
c ¼ Pð0; TÞ½FBNðd1Þ  KNðd2Þ
ð29:1Þ
p ¼ Pð0; TÞ½KNðd2Þ  FBNðd1Þ
ð29:2Þ
where

BT=2
B
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
and
d2 ¼ d1  B
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T
p
In these equations, K is the strike price of the bond option, T is its time to maturity, and
Pð0; TÞ is the (risk-free) discount factor for maturity T.
696
CHAPTER 29

From Section 5.5, FB can be calculated using the formula
FB ¼ B0  I
Pð0; TÞ
ð29:3Þ
where B0 is the bond price at time zero and I is the present value of the coupons that
will be paid during the life of the option. In this formula, both the spot bond price and
the forward bond price are cash prices rather than quoted prices. The relationship
between cash and quoted bond prices is explained in Section 6.1.
The strike price K in equations (29.1) and (29.2) should be the cash strike price. In
choosing the correct value for K, the precise terms of the option are therefore
important. If the strike price is deﬁned as the cash amount that is exchanged for the
bond when the option is exercised, K should be set equal to this strike price. If, as is
more common, the strike price is the quoted price applicable when the option is
exercised, K should be set equal to the strike price plus accrued interest at the expiration
date of the option. Traders refer to the quoted price of a bond as the clean price and the
cash price as the dirty price.
Example 29.1
Consider a 10-month European call option on a 9.75-year bond with a face
value of $1,000. (When the option matures, the bond will have 8 years and
11 months remaining.) Suppose that the current cash bond price is $960, the
strike price is $l,000, the 10-month risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum, and
the volatility of the forward bond price for a contract maturing in 10 months is
9% per annum. The bond pays a coupon of 10% per year (with payments made
semiannually). Coupon payments of $50 are expected in 3 months and 9 months.
(This means that the accrued interest is $25 and the quoted bond price is $935.)
We suppose that the 3-month and 9-month risk-free interest rates are 9.0% and
9.5% per annum, respectively. The present value of the coupon payments is,
therefore,
50e0:250:09 þ 50e0:750:095 ¼ 95:45
or $95.45. The bond forward price is from equation (29.3) given by
FB ¼ ð960  95:45Þe0:10:8333 ¼ 939:68
(a) If the strike price is the cash price that would be paid for the bond on exercise,
the parameters for equation (29.1) are FB ¼ 939:68, K ¼ 1000, Pð0; TÞ ¼
e0:1ð10=12Þ ¼ 0:9200, B ¼ 0:09, and T ¼ 10=12. The price of the call option
is $9.49.
(b) If the strike price is the quoted price that would be paid for the bond on
exercise, 1 month’s accrued interest must be added to K because the maturity
of the option is 1 month after a coupon date. This produces a value for K of
1,000 þ 100  0:08333 ¼ 1,008:33
The values for the other parameters in equation (29.1) are unchanged (i.e.,
FB ¼ 939:68, Pð0; TÞ ¼ 0:9200, B ¼ 0:09, and T ¼ 0:8333). The price of the
option is $7.97.
Figure 29.1 shows how the standard deviation of the logarithm of a bond’s price
Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models

changes as we look further ahead. The standard deviation is zero today because there is
no uncertainty about the bond’s price today. It is also zero at the bond’s maturity
because we know that the bond’s price will equal its face value at maturity. Between
today and the maturity of the bond, the standard deviation ﬁrst increases and then
decreases.
The volatility B that should be used when a European option on the bond is valued is

CHAPTER 29

Yield Volatilities
The volatilities that are quoted for bond options are often yield volatilities rather than
price volatilities. The duration concept, introduced in Chapter 4, is used by the market
to convert a quoted yield volatility into a price volatility. Suppose that D is the modiﬁed
duration of the bond underlying the option at the option maturity, as deﬁned in
Chapter 4. The relationship between the change FB in the forward bond price FB
and the change yF in the forward yield yF is
FB
FB
 DyF
or
FB
FB
 DyF
yF
yF
Volatility is a measure of the standard deviation of percentage changes in the value of a
variable. This equation therefore suggests that the volatility of the forward bond price
B used in Black’s model can be approximately related to the volatility of the forward
bond yield y by
B ¼ Dy0y
ð29:4Þ
where y0 is the initial value of yF. When a yield volatility is quoted for a European bond
option, the implicit assumption is usually that it will be converted to a price volatility
using equation (29.4), and that this volatility will then be used in conjunction with
equation (29.1) or (29.2) to obtain the option’s price. Suppose that the bond underlying a
call option will have a modiﬁed duration of 5 years at option maturity, the forward yield
is 8%, and the forward yield volatility quoted by a broker is 20%. This means that the
market price of the option corresponding to the broker quote is the price given by
equation (29.1) when the volatility variable B is
5  0:08  0:2 ¼ 0:08
or 8% per annum. Figure 29.2 shows that forward bond volatilities depend on the
option considered. Forward yield volatilities as we have just deﬁned them are more
constant. This is why traders prefer them.
The Bond_Options worksheet of the software DerivaGem accompanying this book
can be used to price European bond options using Black’s model by selecting Black-
European as the Pricing Model. The user inputs a yield volatility, which is handled in
the way just described. The strike price can be the cash or quoted strike price.
Example 29.2
Consider a European put option on a 10-year bond with a principal of 100. The
coupon is 8% per year payable semiannually. The life of the option is 2.25 years
and the strike price of the option is 115. The forward yield volatility is 20%. The
zero curve is ﬂat at 5% with continuous compounding. The DerivaGem software
accompanying this book shows that the quoted price of the bond is 122.82. The
price of the option when the strike price is a quoted price is $2.36. When the strike
price is a cash price, the price of the option is $1.74. (See Problem 29.16 for the
manual calculation.)

29.2
INTEREST RATE CAPS AND FLOORS
A popular interest rate option oﬀered by ﬁnancial institutions in the over-the-counter
market is an interest rate cap. Interest rate caps can best be understood by ﬁrst
considering a ﬂoating-rate note where the interest rate is reset periodically equal to
LIBOR. The time between resets is known as the tenor. Suppose the tenor is 3 months.
The interest rate on the note for the ﬁrst 3 months is the initial 3-month LIBOR rate;
the interest rate for the next 3 months is set equal to the 3-month LIBOR rate prevailing
in the market at the 3-month point; and so on.
An interest rate cap is designed to provide insurance against the rate of interest on the
ﬂoating-rate note rising above a certain level. This level is known as the cap rate.
Suppose that the principal amount is $10 million, the tenor is 3 months, the life of the
cap is 5 years, and the cap rate is 4%. (Because the payments are made quarterly, this
cap rate is expressed with quarterly compounding.) The cap provides insurance against
the interest on the ﬂoating rate note rising above 4%.
For the moment we ignore day count issues and assume that there is exactly 0.25 year
between each payment date. (We will cover day count issues at the end of this section.)
Suppose that on a particular reset date the 3-month LIBOR interest rate is 5%. The
ﬂoating rate note would require
0:25  0:05  $10,000,000 ¼ $125,000
of interest to be paid 3 months later. With a 3-month LIBOR rate of 4% the interest
payment would be
0:25  0:04  $10,000,000 ¼ $100,000
The cap therefore provides a payoﬀof $25,000. The payoﬀdoes not occur on the reset
date when the 5% is observed: it occurs 3 months later. This reﬂects the usual time lag
between an interest rate being observed and the corresponding payment being required.
At each reset date during the life of the cap, LIBOR is observed. If LIBOR is less than
4%, there is no payoﬀfrom the cap three months later. If LIBOR is greater than 4%, the
payoﬀis one quarter of the excess applied to the principal of $10 million. Note that caps
are usually deﬁned so that the initial LIBOR rate, even if it is greater than the cap rate,
does not lead to a payoﬀon the ﬁrst reset date. In our example, the cap lasts for 5 years.
There are, therefore, a total of 19 reset dates (at times 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, . . . , 4.75 years)
and 19 potential payoﬀs from the caps (at times 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, . . . , 5.00 years).
The Cap as a Portfolio of Interest Rate Options
Consider a cap with a total life of T, a principal of L, and a cap rate of RK. Suppose that
the reset dates are t1, t2, . . . , tn and deﬁne tnþ1 ¼ T. Deﬁne Rk as the LIBOR interest rate
for the period between time tk and tkþ1 observed at time tk (1 6 k 6 n). The cap leads to a
payoﬀat time tkþ1 (k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n) of
Lk maxðRk  RK; 0Þ
ð29:5Þ
where k ¼ tkþ1  tk.1 Both Rk and RK are expressed with a compounding frequency
equal to the frequency of resets.
1 Day count issues are discussed at the end of this section.
700
CHAPTER 29

Expression (29.5) is the payoﬀfrom a call option on the LIBOR rate observed at time tk
with the payoﬀoccurring at time tkþ1. The cap is a portfolio of n such options. LIBOR
rates are observed at times t1; t2; t3; . . . ; tn and the corresponding payoﬀs occur at
times t2; t3; t4; . . . ; tnþ1. The n call options underlying the cap are known as caplets.
A Cap as a Portfolio of Bond Options
An interest rate cap can also be characterized as a portfolio of put options on zero-
coupon bonds with payoﬀs on the puts occurring at the time they are calculated. The
payoﬀin expression (29.5) at time tkþ1 is equivalent to
Lk
1 þ Rkk
maxðRk  RK; 0Þ
at time tk. A few lines of algebra show that this reduces to
max

L  Lð1 þ RKkÞ
1 þ Rkk
; 0

ð29:6Þ
The expression
Lð1 þ RKkÞ
1 þ Rkk
is the value at time tk of a zero-coupon bond that pays oﬀLð1 þ RKkÞ at time tkþ1. The
expression in (29.6) is therefore the payoﬀfrom a put option with maturity tk on a zero-
coupon bond with maturity tkþ1 when the face value of the bond is Lð1 þ RKkÞ and the
strike price is L. It follows that an interest rate cap can be regarded as a portfolio of
European put options on zero-coupon bonds.
Floors and Collars
Interest rate ﬂoors and interest rate collars (sometimes called ﬂoor–ceiling agreements)
are deﬁned analogously to caps. A ﬂoor provides a payoﬀwhen the interest rate on the
underlying ﬂoating-rate note falls below a certain rate. With the notation already
introduced, a ﬂoor provides a payoﬀat time tkþ1 (k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n) of
Lk maxðRK  Rk; 0Þ
Analogously to an interest rate cap, an interest rate ﬂoor is a portfolio of put options on
interest rates or a portfolio of call options on zero-coupon bonds. Each of the
individual options comprising a ﬂoor is known as a ﬂoorlet. A collar is an instrument
designed to guarantee that the interest rate on the underlying LIBOR ﬂoating-rate note
always lies between two levels. A collar is a combination of a long position in a cap and
a short position in a ﬂoor. It is usually constructed so that the price of the cap is
initially equal to the price of the ﬂoor. The cost of entering into the collar is then zero.
Business Snapshot 29.1 gives the put–call parity relationship between caps and ﬂoors.
Valuation of Caps and Floors

Consider a contract that caps the LIBOR interest rate on $10 million at 8% per

used as risk-free discount rates and the LIBOR/swap zero curve is ﬂat at 7% per
annum with quarterly compounding, with the volatility of the 3-month forward
rate underlying the caplet being 20% per annum. The continuously compounded
zero rate for all maturities is 6.9395%. In equation (29.7), Fk ¼ 0:07, k ¼ 0:25,
L ¼ 10, RK ¼ 0:08, tk ¼ 1:0, tkþ1 ¼ 1:25, Pð0; tkþ1Þ ¼ e0:0693951:25 ¼ 0:9169,
Business Snapshot 29.1
Put–Call Parity for Caps and Floors
There is a put–call parity relationship between the prices of caps and ﬂoors. This is
Value of cap ¼ Value of floor þ Value of swap
In this relationship, the cap and ﬂoor have the same strike price, RK. The swap is an
agreement to receive LIBOR and pay a ﬁxed rate of RK with no exchange of
payments on the ﬁrst reset date. All three instruments have the same life and the
same frequency of payments.
To see that the result is true, consider a long position in the cap combined with a
short position in the ﬂoor. The cap provides a cash ﬂow of LIBOR  RK for
periods when LIBOR is greater than RK. The short ﬂoor provides a cash ﬂow of
ðRK  LIBORÞ ¼ LIBOR  RK for periods when LIBOR is less than RK. There is
therefore a cash ﬂow of LIBOR  RK in all circumstances. This is the cash ﬂow on
the swap. It follows that the value of the cap minus the value of the ﬂoor must
equal the value of the swap.
Note that swaps are usually structured so that LIBOR at time zero determines a
payment on the ﬁrst reset date. Caps and ﬂoors are usually structured so that there is
no payoﬀon the ﬁrst reset date. This is why put–call parity involves a nonstandard
swap where there is no payment on the ﬁrst reset date.

Each caplet of a cap must be valued separately using equation (29.7). Similarly, each
ﬂoorlet of a ﬂoor must be valued separately using equation (29.8). One approach is to use
a diﬀerent volatility for each caplet (or ﬂoorlet). The volatilities are then referred to as
spot volatilities. An alternative approach is to use the same volatility for all the caplets
(ﬂoorlets) comprising any particular cap (ﬂoor) but to vary this volatility according to
the life of the cap (ﬂoor). The volatilities used are then referred to as ﬂat volatilities.2 The
volatilities quoted in the market are usually ﬂat volatilities. However, many traders like to
estimate spot volatilities because this allows them to identify underpriced and overpriced
caplets (ﬂoorlets). The put (call) options on Eurodollar futures are very similar to caplets
(ﬂoorlets) and the spot volatilities used for caplets and ﬂoorlets on 3-month LIBOR are
frequently compared with those calculated from the prices of Eurodollar futures options.
Spot Volatilities vs. Flat Volatilities
Figure 29.3 shows a typical pattern for spot volatilities and ﬂat volatilities as a function of
maturity. (In the case of a spot volatility, the maturity is the maturity of a caplet or
ﬂoorlet; in the case of a ﬂat volatility, it is the maturity of a cap or ﬂoor.) The ﬂat

volatilities are akin to cumulative averages of the spot volatilities and therefore exhibit
less variability. As indicated by Figure 29.3, a ‘‘hump’’ in the volatilities is usually
observed. The peak of the hump is at about the 2- to 3-year point. This hump is observed
both when the volatilities are implied from option prices and when they are calculated
from historical data. There is no general agreement on the reason for the existence of the
hump. One possible explanation is as follows. Rates at the short end of the zero curve are
controlled by central banks. By contrast, 2- and 3-year interest rates are determined to a
large extent by the activities of traders. These traders may be overreacting to the changes
observed in the short rate and causing the volatility of these rates to be higher than the
volatlity of short rates. For maturities beyond 2 to 3 years, the mean reversion of interest
rates, which is discussed in Chapter 31, causes volatilities to decline.
Interdealer brokers provide tables of implied ﬂat volatilities for caps and ﬂoors. The
instruments underlying the quotes are usually ‘‘at the money’’. This is deﬁned as the
situation where the cap/ﬂoor rate equals the swap rate for a swap that has the same
payment dates as the cap. Table 29.1 shows typical broker quotes for the US dollar
market. The tenor of the cap is 3 months and the cap life varies from 1 to 10 years. The
data exhibits the type of ‘‘hump’’ shown in Figure 29.3.
Theoretical Justiﬁcation for the Model
The extension of Black’s model used to value a caplet can be shown to be internally
consistent by considering a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to a risk-free
zero-coupon bond maturing at time tkþ1. Section 28.4 shows that:
1. The current value of any security is its expected value at time tkþ1 in this world
multiplied by the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time tkþ1 (see
equation (28.20)).
2. The expected value of a risk-free interest rate lasting between times tk and tkþ1
equals the forward interest rate in this world (see equation (28.22)).
The ﬁrst of these results shows that, with the notation introduced earlier, the price of a
caplet that provides a payoﬀat time tkþ1 is

where Ekþ1 denotes expected value in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to
a zero-coupon bond maturing at time tkþ1. When the forward interest rate underlying the

we are considering, with the standard deviation of lnðRkÞ equal to k

The second result implies that

This result is true if LIBOR is used as the risk-free discount rate from equation (28.22).
In Section 29.4, we show that it is true for OIS discounting provided that forward
LIBOR rates are determined in a way consistent with OIS discounting. Together the
results lead to the cap pricing model in equation (29.7). They show that we can discount
at the tkþ1-maturity interest rate observed in the market today providing we set the
expected interest rate equal to the forward interest rate.
Use of DerivaGem
The software DerivaGem accompanying this book can be used to price interest rate
caps and ﬂoors using Black’s model. In the Cap_and_Swap_Option worksheet select
Cap/Floor as the Underlying Type and Black-European as the Pricing Model. The
LIBOR/swap zero curve is input using continuously compounded rates. (For OIS
discounting, the OIS zero curve must also be input.) The inputs include the start and
end date of the period covered by the cap, the ﬂat volatility, and the cap settlement
frequency (i.e., the tenor). The software calculates the payment dates by working back
from the end of period covered by the cap to the beginning. The initial caplet/ﬂoorlet is
assumed to cover a period of length between 0.5 and 1.5 times a regular period.
Suppose, for example, that the period covered by the cap is 1.22 years to 2.80 years
and the settlement frequency is quarterly. There are six caplets covering the periods 2.55
to 2.80 years, 2.30 to 2.55 years, 2.05 to 2.30 years, 1.80 to 2.05 years, 1.55 to 1.80 years,
and 1.22 to 1.55 years.
The Impact of Day Count Conventions
The formulas we have presented so far in this section do not reﬂect day count
conventions (see Section 6.1 for an explanation of day count conventions). Suppose
that the cap rate RK is expressed with an actual/360 day count (as would be normal in
the United States). This means that the time interval k in the formulas should be
replaced by ak, the accrual fraction for the time period between tk and tkþ1. Suppose,
for example, that tk is May 1 and tkþ1 is August 1. Under actual/360 there are 92 days
Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models
705

between these payment dates so that ak ¼ 92=360 ¼ 0:2556. The forward rate Fk must
be expressed with an actual/360 day count. This means that we must set it by solving
1 þ akFk ¼ Pð0; tkÞ
Pð0; tkþ1Þ
The impact of all this is much the same as calculating k on an actual/actual basis
converting RK from actual/360 to actual/actual, and calculating Fk on an actual/actual
basis by solving
1 þ kFk ¼ Pð0; tkÞ
Pð0; tkþ1Þ
29.3
EUROPEAN SWAP OPTIONS
Swap options, or swaptions, are options on interest rate swaps and are another popular
type of interest rate option. They give the holder the right to enter into a certain interest
rate swap at a certain time in the future. (The holder does not, of course, have to exercise
this right.) Many large ﬁnancial institutions that oﬀer interest rate swap contracts to their
corporate clients are also prepared to sell them swaptions or buy swaptions from them.
As shown in Business Snapshot 29.2, a swaption can be viewed as a type of bond option.
To give an example of how a swaption might be used, consider a company that knows
that in 6 months it will enter into a 5-year ﬂoating-rate loan agreement and knows that
it will wish to swap the ﬂoating interest payments for ﬁxed interest payments to convert
the loan into a ﬁxed-rate loan (see Chapter 7 for a discussion of how swaps can be used
in this way). At a cost, the company could enter into a swaption giving it the right to
receive 6-month LIBOR and pay a certain ﬁxed rate of interest, say 3% per annum, for
a 5-year period starting in 6 months. If the ﬁxed rate exchanged for ﬂoating on a regular
5-year swap in 6 months turns out to be less than 3% per annum, the company will
choose not to exercise the swaption and will enter into a swap agreement in the usual
way. However, if it turns out to be greater than 3% per annum, the company will
choose to exercise the swaption and will obtain a swap at more favorable terms than
those available in the market.
Swaptions, when used in the way just described, provide companies with a guarantee
that the ﬁxed rate of interest they will pay on a loan at some future time will not exceed
some level. They are an alternative to forward swaps (sometimes called deferred swaps).
Forward swaps involve no up-front cost but have the disadvantage of obligating the
company to enter into a swap agreement. With a swaption, the company is able to beneﬁt
from favorable interest rate movements while acquiring protection from unfavorable
interest rate movements. The diﬀerence between a swaption and a forward swap is
analogous to the diﬀerence between an option on a foreign currency and a forward
contract on the currency.
Valuation of European Swaptions
As explained in Chapter 7 the swap rate for a particular maturity at a particular time is
the (mid-market) ﬁxed rate that would be exchanged for LIBOR in a newly issued swap
with that maturity. The model usually used to value a European option on a swap
assumes that the underlying swap rate at the maturity of the option is lognormal.
706
CHAPTER 29

Consider a swaption where the holder has the right to pay a rate sK and receive LIBOR
on a swap that will last n years starting in T years. We suppose that there are m
payments per year under the swap and that the notional principal is L.
Chapter 7 showed that day count conventions may lead to the ﬁxed payments under a
swap being slightly diﬀerent on each payment date. For now we will ignore the eﬀect of
day count conventions and assume that each ﬁxed payment on the swap is the ﬁxed rate
times L=m. The impact of day count conventions is considered at the end of this section.
Suppose that the swap rate for an n-year swap starting at time T proves to be sT. By
comparing the cash ﬂows on a swap where the ﬁxed rate is sT to the cash ﬂows on a swap
where the ﬁxed rate is sK, it can be seen that the payoﬀfrom the swaption consists of a
series of cash ﬂows equal to
L
m maxðsT  sK; 0Þ
The cash ﬂows are received m times per year for the n years of the life of the swap.
Suppose that the swap payment dates are T1, T2, . . . , Tmn, measured in years from today.
(It is approximately true that Ti ¼ T þ i=m.) Each cash ﬂow is the payoﬀfrom a call
option on sT with strike price sK.
Whereas a cap is a portfolio of options on interest rates, a swaption is a single option
on the swap rate with repeated payoﬀs. The standard market model gives the value of a
swaption where the holder has the right to pay sK as

Swaptions and Bond Options
As explained in Chapter 7, an interest rate swap can be regarded as an agreement to
exchange a ﬁxed-rate bond for a ﬂoating-rate bond. At the start of a swap, the value
of the ﬂoating-rate bond always equals the principal amount of the swap. A swaption
can therefore be regarded as an option to exchange a ﬁxed-rate bond for the principal
amount of the swap—that is, a type of bond option.
If a swaption gives the holder the right to pay ﬁxed and receive ﬂoating, it is a put
option on the ﬁxed-rate bond with strike price equal to the principal. If a swaption
gives the holder the right to pay ﬂoating and receive ﬁxed, it is a call option on the
ﬁxed-rate bond with a strike price equal to the principal.

DerivaGem can be used to value swaptions using Black’s model. In the Cap_and_
Swap_Options worksheet, select Swap Options as the Underlying Type and Black-
European as the pricing model. The LIBOR/swap zero curve and, where necessary,
the OIS zero curve are input using continuously compounded rates.
Example 29.4
Suppose that the LIBOR yield curve (which we assume is used for discounting) is
ﬂat at 6% per annum with continuous compounding. Consider a swaption that
gives the holder the right to pay 6.2% in a 3-year swap starting in 5 years. The
volatility of the forward swap rate is 20%. Payments are made semiannually and
the principal is $100 million. In this case,

A rate of 6% per annum with continuous compounding translates into 6.09%
with semiannual compounding. It follows that, in this example, s0 ¼ 0:0609,

Broker Quotes
Interdealer brokers provide tables of implied volatilities for European swaptions (i.e.,
values of  implied by market prices when equations (29.10) and (29.11) are used). The
instruments underlying the quotes are usually ‘‘at the money’’ in the sense that the
strike swap rate equals the forward swap rate. Table 29.2 shows typical broker quotes
provided for the US dollar market. The life of the option is shown on the vertical scale.
This varies from 1 month to 5 years. The life of the underlying swap at the maturity of
the option is shown on the horizontal scale. This varies from 1 to 10 years. The
volatilities in the 1-year column of the table exhibit a hump similar to that discussed
for caps earlier. As we move to the columns corresponding to options on longer-lived
swaps, the hump persists but it becomes less pronounced.
Theoretical Justiﬁcation for the Swaption Model
The extension of Black’s model used for swaptions can be shown to be internally
consistent by considering a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to the
annuity A. The analysis in Section 28.4 shows that:
1. The current value of any security is the current value of the annuity multiplied by
the expected value of
Security price at time T
Value of the annuity at time T
in this world (see equation (28.25)).
2. The expected value of the swap rate at time T in this world equals the forward
swap rate (see equation (28.24)).
The ﬁrst result shows that the value of the swaption is

The second result shows that EAðsTÞ equals s0. (This is true if LIBOR is used as the

risk-free discount rate from equation (28.24). In Section 29.4, we show that it is true for
OIS discounting provided that forward swap rates are determined in a way consistent
with OIS discounting.) Taken together, the results lead to the swap option pricing
formula in equation (29.10). They show that interest rates can be treated as constant
for the purposes of discounting provided that the expected swap rate is set equal to the
forward swap rate.
The Impact of Day Count Conventions
The above formulas can be made more precise by considering day count conventions.
The ﬁxed rate for the swap underlying the swap option is expressed with a day count
convention such as actual/365 or 30/360. Suppose that T0 ¼ T and that, for the
applicable day count convention, the accrual fraction corresponding to the time period
between Ti1 and Ti is ai. (For example, if Ti1 corresponds to March 1 and Ti
corresponds to September 1 and the day count is actual/365, ai ¼ 184=365 ¼ 0:5041.)
The formulas that have been presented are then correct with the annuity factor A being
deﬁned as
A ¼
X
mn
i¼1
aiPð0; TiÞ
For LIBOR discounting, forward swap rates can be calculated using equation (28.23).
29.4
OIS DISCOUNTING
The cap/ﬂoor and swaption arguments we have made so far in this chapter have
assumed that LIBOR is used not only to determine cash ﬂows but also to determine
risk-free discount rates. When OIS discounting is used, the approach outlined in
Section 9.3 can be used to determine forward LIBOR rates. The forward LIBOR rate
for the period between tk and tkþ1 is then Ekþ1ðRkÞ, where Rk is the realized LIBOR rate
for this period and Ekþ1 denotes expectations in a world that is forward risk-neutral
with respect to a risk-free (OIS) zero-coupon bond maturing at time tkþ1.
For the valuation of caps, equation (29.9) is still correct. It leads to equation (29.7) if Fk
is deﬁned as Ekþ1ðRkÞ and Pð0; tkþ1Þ is calculated from the OIS zero curve.
Arguments concerning the valuation of swaptions are similar. When OIS discounting
is used, equations (29.10) and (29.11) are correct. The annuity factor A is calculated
from the OIS zero curve. The forward swap rate s0 is calculated from the forward
LIBOR rates so that the forward swap is worth zero when OIS discounting is used.
These points are discussed further in Section 32.3.
29.5
HEDGING INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES
This section discusses how the material on Greek letters in Chapter 19 can be extended
to cover interest rate derivatives.
In the context of interest rate derivatives, delta risk is the risk associated with a shift
710
CHAPTER 29

in the zero curve. Because there are many ways in which the zero curve can shift, many
deltas can be calculated. Some alternatives are:
1. Calculate the impact of a 1-basis-point parallel shift in the zero curve. This is
sometimes termed a DV01.
2. Calculate the impact of small changes in the quotes for each of the instruments
used to construct the zero curve.
3. Divide the zero curve (or the forward curve) into a number of sections (or
buckets). Calculate the impact of shifting the rates in one bucket by 1 basis point,
keeping the rest of the initial term structure unchanged. (This is described in
Business Snapshot 6.3.)
4. Carry out a principal components analysis as outlined in Section 22.9. Calculate a
delta with respect to the changes in each of the ﬁrst few factors. The ﬁrst delta then
measures the impact of a small, approximately parallel, shift in the zero curve; the
second delta measures the impact of a small twist in the zero curve; and so on.
In practice, traders tend to prefer the second approach. They argue that the only way
the zero curve can change is if the quote for one of the instruments used to compute the
zero curve changes. They therefore feel that it makes sense to focus on the exposures
arising from changes in the prices of these instruments.
When several delta measures are calculated, there are many possible gamma measures.
Suppose that 10 instruments are used to compute the zero curve and that deltas are
calculated by considering the impact of changes in the quotes for each of these. Gamma
is a second partial derivative of the form @2=@xi @xj, where  is the portfolio value.
There are 10 choices for xi and 10 choices for xj and a total of 55 diﬀerent gamma
measures. This may be ‘‘information overload’’. One approach is ignore cross-gammas
and focus on the 10 partial derivatives where i ¼ j. Another is to calculate a single
gamma measure as the second partial derivative of the value of the portfolio with respect
to a parallel shift in the zero curve. A further possibility is to calculate gammas with
respect to the ﬁrst two factors in a principal components analysis.
The vega of a portfolio of interest rate derivatives measures its exposure to volatility
changes. One approach is to calculate the impact on the portfolio of making the same
small change to the Black volatilities of all caps and European swap options. However,
this assumes that one factor drives all volatilities and may be too simplistic. A better
idea is to carry out a principal components analysis on the volatilities of caps and swap
options and calculate vega measures corresponding to the ﬁrst 2 or 3 factors.
SUMMARY
Black’s model and its extensions provide a popular approach for valuing European-
style interest rate options. The essence of Black’s model is that the value of the variable
underlying the option is assumed to be lognormal at the maturity of the option. In the
case of a European bond option, Black’s model assumes that the underlying bond price
is lognormal at the option’s maturity. For a cap, the model assumes that the interest
rates underlying each of the constituent caplets are lognormally distributed. In the case
of a swap option, the model assumes that the underlying swap rate is lognormally
distributed.
Interest Rate Derivatives: The Standard Market Models
711

Each of the models we have presented in this chapter is internally consistent, but the
models are not consistent with each other. For example, when future bond prices are
lognormal, future interest rates and swap rates are not lognormal; when future interest
rates are lognormal, future bond prices and swap rates are not lognormal. The models
cannot easily be extended to value instruments such as American swap options.
Chapters 31 and 32 present more general interest rate models, which, although more
complex, can be used for a much wider range of products.
Black’s model involves calculating the expected payoﬀbased on the assumption that
the expected value of a variable equals its forward value and then discounting the
expected payoﬀat the zero rate observed in the market today. This is the correct
procedure for the ‘‘plain vanilla’’ instruments we have considered in this chapter.
However, as we shall see in the next chapter, it is not correct in all situations.

at 13% (quoted with quarterly compounding) on a principal amount of $1,000. The
forward interest rate for the period in question is 12% per annum (quoted with quarterly
compounding), the 18-month risk-free interest rate (continuously compounded) is 11.5%
per annum, and the volatility of the forward rate is 12% per annum.
29.6. A bank uses Black’s model to price European bond options. Suppose that an implied price
volatility for a 5-year option on a bond maturing in 10 years is used to price a 9-year
option on the bond. Would you expect the resultant price to be too high or too low?
Explain.
29.7. Calculate the value of a 4-year European call option on bond that will mature 5 years

4.2 years and the forward yield on the bond is 7%.

29.14. What is the value of a European swap option that gives the holder the right to enter into
a 3-year annual-pay swap in 4 years where a ﬁxed rate of 5% is paid and LIBOR is
received? The swap principal is $10 million. Assume that the LIBOR/swap yield curve is
used for discounting and is ﬂat at 5% per annum with annual compounding and that the
volatility of the swap rate is 20%. Compare your answer with that given by DerivaGem.
Now suppose that all swap rates are are 5% and all OIS rates are 4.7%. Use DerivaGem

29.15. Suppose that the yield R on a zero-coupon bond follows the process
dR ¼  dt þ  dz

for swaps with semiannual payments are 6%, 6.4%, 6.7%, 6.9%, and 7%. The price of a
5-year semiannual cap with a principal of $100 and a cap rate of 8% is $3. Use
DerivaGem to determine:
(a) The 5-year ﬂat volatility for caps and ﬂoors with LIBOR discounting
(b) The ﬂoor rate in a zero-cost 5-year collar when the cap rate is 8% and LIBOR
discounting is used.
(c) Answer (a) and (b) if OIS discounting is used and OIS swap rates are 100 basis
points below LIBOR swap rates.
29.18. Show that V1 þ f ¼ V2, where V1 is the value of a swaption to pay a ﬁxed rate of sK and
receive LIBOR between times T1 and T2, f is the value of a forward swap to receive a
ﬁxed rate of sK and pay LIBOR between times T1 and T2, and V2 is the value of a
swaption to receive a ﬁxed rate of sK between times T1 and T2. Deduce that V1 ¼ V2 when
sK equals the current forward swap rate.

Further Questions
29.21. Consider an 8-month European put option on a Treasury bond that currently has 14.25
years to maturity. The current cash bond price is $910, the exercise price is $900, and the
volatility for the bond price is 10% per annum. A coupon of $35 will be paid by the
bond in 3 months. The risk-free interest rate is 8% for all maturities up to 1 year. Use
Black’s model to determine the price of the option. Consider both the case where the
strike price corresponds to the cash price of the bond and the case where it corresponds
to the quoted price.
29.22. Calculate the price of a cap on the 90-day LIBOR rate in 9 months’ time when the
principal amount is $1,000. Use Black’s model with LIBOR discounting and the
following information:
(a) The quoted 9-month Eurodollar futures price ¼ 92. (Ignore diﬀerences between
futures and forward rates.)
(b) The interest rate volatility implied by a 9-month Eurodollar option ¼ 15% per
annum.
(c) The current 12-month risk-free interest rate with continuous compounding ¼ 7.5%
per annum.
(d) The cap rate ¼ 8% per annum. (Assume an actual/360 day count.)
29.23. Suppose that the LIBOR yield curve is ﬂat at 8% with annual compounding. A swaption
gives the holder the right to receive 7.6% in a 5-year swap starting in 4 years. Payments
are made annually. The volatility of the forward swap rate is 25% per annum and the
principal is $1 million. Use Black’s model to price the swaption with LIBOR discount-
ing. Compare your answer with that given by DerivaGem.
29.24. Use the DerivaGem software to value a 5-year collar that guarantees that the maximum
and minimum interest rates on a LIBOR-based loan (with quarterly resets) are 7% and
5%, respectively. The LIBOR and OIS zero curves are currently ﬂat at 6% and 5.8%,
respectively (with continuous compounding). Use a ﬂat volatility of 20%. Assume that
the principal is $100. Use OIS discounting.
29.25. Use the DerivaGem software to value a European swaption that gives you the right in
2 years to enter into a 5-year swap in which you pay a ﬁxed rate of 6% and receive
ﬂoating. Cash ﬂows are exchanged semiannually on the swap. The 1-year, 2-year, 5-year,
and 10-year zero-coupon LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap rates where payments are exchanged
semiannually are 5%, 6%, 6.5%, and 7%, respectively. Assume a principal of $100 and a

CHAPTER 29

Convexity,
Timing, and
Quanto
Adjustments
A popular two-step procedure for valuing a European-style derivative is:
1. Calculate the expected payoﬀby assuming that the expected value of each
underlying variable equals its forward value
2. Discount the expected payoﬀat the risk-free rate applicable for the time period
between the valuation date and the payoﬀdate.
We ﬁrst used this procedure when valuing FRAs and swaps. Chapter 4 shows that an
FRA can be valued by calculating the payoﬀon the assumption that the forward
interest rate will be realized and then discounting the payoﬀat the risk-free rate.
Similarly, Chapter 7 extends this, showing that swaps can be valued by calculating
cash ﬂows on the assumption that forward rates will be realized and discounting the
cash ﬂows at risk-free rates. Chapters 18 and 28 show that Black’s model provides a
general approach to valuing a wide range of European options—and Black’s model is
an application of the two-step procedure. The models presented in Chapter 29 for bond
options, caps/ﬂoors, and swap options are all examples of the two-step procedure.
This raises the issue of whether it is always correct to value European-style interest
rate derivatives by using the two-step procedure. The answer is no! For nonstandard
interest rate derivatives, it is sometimes necessary to modify the two-step procedure so
that an adjustment is made to the forward value of the variable in the ﬁrst step. This
chapter considers three types of adjustments: convexity adjustments, timing adjust-
ments, and quanto adjustments.
30.1
CONVEXITY ADJUSTMENTS
Consider ﬁrst an instrument that provides a payoﬀdependent on a bond yield observed
at the time of the payoﬀ.
Usually the forward value of a variable S is calculated with reference to a forward
contract that pays oﬀST  K at time T. It is the value of K that causes the contract to
have zero value. As discussed in Section 28.4, forward interest rates and forward yields
715
30
C H A P T E R

are deﬁned diﬀerently. A forward interest rate is the rate implied by a forward zero-
coupon bond. More generally, a forward bond yield is the yield implied by the forward
bond price.
Suppose that BT is the price of a bond at time T, yT is its yield, and the (bond pricing)
relationship between BT and yT is
BT ¼ GðyTÞ
Deﬁne F0 as the forward bond price at time zero for a transaction maturing at time T
and y0 as the forward bond yield at time zero. The deﬁnition of a forward bond yield
means that
F0 ¼ Gðy0Þ
The function G is nonlinear. This means that, when the expected future bond price
equals the forward bond price (so that we are in a world that is forward risk neutral
with respect to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T), the expected future bond yield
does not equal the forward bond yield.
This is illustrated in Figure 30.1, which shows the relationship between bond prices
and bond yields at time T. For simplicity, suppose that there are only three possible
bond prices, B1, B2, and B3 and that they are equally likely in a world that is forward
risk neutral with respect to Pðt; TÞ. Assume that the bond prices are equally spaced, so
that B2  B1 ¼ B3  B2. The forward bond price is the expected bond price B2. The
bond prices translate into three equally likely bond yields: y1, y2, and y3. These are not
equally spaced. The variable y2 is the forward bond yield because it is the yield
corresponding to the forward bond price. The expected bond yield is the average of
y1, y2, and y3 and is clearly greater than y2.
Consider a derivative that provides a payoﬀdependent on the bond yield at time T.
From equation (28.20), it can be valued by (a) calculating the expected payoﬀin a world
that is forward risk neutral with respect to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T and
(b) discounting at the current risk-free rate for maturity T. We know that the expected
bond price equals the forward price in the world being considered. We therefore need to

where G0 and G00 denote the ﬁrst and second partial derivatives of G, ET denotes

forward yield volatility. It follows that the expected payoﬀcan be discounted at the
current risk-free rate for maturity T provided the expected bond yield is assumed to be

is known as a convexity adjustment. It corresponds to the diﬀerence between y2 and the
expected yield in Figure 30.1. (The convexity adjustment is positive because G0ðy0Þ < 0
and G00ðy0Þ > 0.)
Application 1: Interest Rates
For a ﬁrst application of equation (30.1), consider an instrument that provides a cash ﬂow
at time T equal to the interest rate between times T and T  applied to a principal of L.
(This example will be useful when we consider LIBOR-in-arrears swaps in Chapter 33.)
Note that the interest rate applicable to the time period between times T and T  is
normally paid at time T ; here it is assumed that it is paid early, at time T.
The cash ﬂow at time T is LRT, where  ¼ T   T and RT is the zero-coupon interest
rate applicable to the period between T and T  (expressed with a compounding period
of ).1 The variable RT can be viewed as the yield at time T on a zero-coupon bond
maturing at time T . The relationship between the price of this bond and its yield is

Example 30.1
Consider a derivative that provides a payoﬀin 3 years equal to the 1-year risk-
free zero-coupon rate (annually compounded) at that time multiplied by $1000.
Suppose that the risk-free zero rate for all maturities is 10% per annum with
annual compounding and the volatility of the forward rate applicable to the time
period between year 3 and year 4 is 20%. In this case, R0 ¼ 0:10, R ¼ 0:20,
T ¼ 3,  ¼ 1, and Pð0; 3Þ ¼ 1=1:103 ¼ 0:7513. The value of the derivative is

or $75.95. (This compares with a price of $75.13 when no convexity adjustment
is made.)
Application 2: Swap Rates
Consider next a derivative providing a payoﬀat time T equal to a swap rate observed at
that time. A swap rate is a par yield when LIBOR discounting is used. For the purposes
of calculating a convexity adjustment we can make an approximation and assume that
the N-year swap rate at time T equals the yield at that time on an N-year bond with a
coupon equal to today’s forward swap rate. This enables equation (30.1) to be used.
Example 30.2
Consider an instrument that provides a payoﬀin 3 years equal to the 3-year swap
rate at that time multiplied by $100. Suppose that payments are made annually
on the swap, the swap rate for all maturities is 12% per annum with annual
compounding, the volatility for the 3-year forward swap rate in 3 years (implied
from swap option prices) is 22%, and the LIBOR/swap zero curve is used for
discounting. When the swap rate is approximated as the yield on a 12% bond,
the relevant function GðyÞ is

In this case the forward yield y0 is 0.12, so that G0ðy0Þ ¼ 2:4018 and
G00ðy0Þ ¼ 8:2546. From equation (30.1),
ETðyTÞ ¼ 0:12 þ 1

assumed when valuing the instrument. The instrument is worth

or $8.80. (This compares with a price of 8.54 obtained without any convexity

TIMING ADJUSTMENTS
In this section consider the situation where a market variable V is observed at time T
and its value is used to calculate a payoﬀthat occurs at a later time T . Deﬁne:
VT : Value of V at time T
ETðVTÞ: Expected value of VT in a world that is forward risk-neutral with respect to

ET ðVTÞ: Expected value of VT in a world that is forward risk-neutral with respect to

This is the forward price of a zero-coupon bond lasting between times T and T . Deﬁne:
V : Volatility of V

VW : Correlation between V and W.
From equation (28.35), the change of numeraire increases the growth rate of V by V,
where
V ¼ VWVW

This result can be expressed in terms of the forward interest rate between times T and T .

Example 30.3
Consider a derivative that provides a payoﬀin 6 years equal to the value of a stock
index observed in 5 years. Suppose that 1,200 is the forward value of the stock
index for a contract maturing in 5 years. Suppose that the volatility of the index is
20%, the volatility of the forward interest rate between years 5 and 6 is 18%, and
the correlation between the two is 0:4. Suppose further that the risk-free zero
curve is ﬂat at 8% with annual compounding. The results just produced can be
used with V deﬁned as the value of the index, T ¼ 5, T  ¼ 6, m ¼ 1, R0 ¼ 0:08,

forward price of the index, or 1,200. It follows that ET ðVT Þ ¼ 1,200  1:00535 ¼
1,206:42. Using again the arguments in Chapter 28, it follows from equation (28.20)
that the value of the derivative is 1,206:42  Pð0; 6Þ. In this case, Pð0; 6Þ ¼
1=1:086 ¼ 0:6302, so that the value of the derivative is 760.25.
Application 1 Revisited
The analysis just given provides a diﬀerent way of producing the result in Application 1
of Section 30.1. Using the notation from that application, RT is the interest rate between
T and T  and R0 as the forward rate for the period between time T and T . From
equation (28.22),

QUANTOS
A quanto or cross-currency derivative is an instrument where two currencies are
involved. The payoﬀis deﬁned in terms of a variable that is measured in one of the
currencies and the payoﬀis made in the other currency. One example of a quanto is the
CME futures contract on the Nikkei discussed in Business Snapshot 5.3. The market
variable underlying this contract is the Nikkei 225 index (which is measured in yen), but
the contract is settled in US dollars.
Consider a quanto that provides a payoﬀin currency X at time T. Assume that the
payoﬀdepends on the value V of a variable that is observed in currency Y at time T.
Deﬁne:
PXðt; TÞ: Value at time t in currency X of a zero-coupon bond paying oﬀ1 unit of
currency X at time T
PYðt; TÞ: Value at time t in currency Y of a zero-coupon bond paying oﬀ1 unit of
currency Y at time T
VT : Value of V at time T
EXðVTÞ: Expected value of VT in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect
to PXðt; TÞ
EYðVTÞ: Expected value of VT in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect
to PYðt; TÞ.
The numeraire ratio when we move from the PYðt; TÞ numeraire to the PXðt; TÞ
numeraire is
WðtÞ ¼ PXðt; TÞ
PYðt; TÞ SðtÞ
where SðtÞ is the spot exchange rate (units of Y per unit of X) at time t. It follows from
this that the numeraire ratio WðtÞ is the forward exchange rate (units of Y per unit of X)
for a contract maturing at time T. Deﬁne:
W Volatility of W
V : Volatility of V
VW : Instantaneous correlation between V and W.

From equation (28.35), the change of numeraire increases the growth rate of V by V,
where

If it is assumed that the volatilities and correlation are constant, this means that
EXðVTÞ ¼ EYðVTÞeVWV WT
or as an approximation
EXðVTÞ ¼ EYðVTÞð1 þ VWVWTÞ
ð30:6Þ
This equation will be used for the valuation of what are known as diﬀswaps in
Chapter 33.
Example 30.4
Suppose that the current value of the Nikkei stock index is 15,000 yen, the 1-year
dollar risk-free rate is 5%, the 1-year yen risk-free rate is 2%, and the Nikkei
dividend yield is 1%. The forward price of the Nikkei for a 1-year contract
denominated in yen can be calculated in the usual way from equation (5.8) as
15,000eð0:020:01Þ1 ¼ 15,150:75
Suppose that the volatility of the index is 20%, the volatility of the 1-year forward
yen per dollar exchange rate is 12%, and the correlation between the two is 0.3. In
this case EYðVTÞ ¼ 15,150:75, V ¼ 0:20, W ¼ 0:12 and  ¼ 0:3. From equa-
tion (30.6), the expected value of the Nikkei in a world that is forward risk neutral
with respect to a dollar bond maturing in 1 year is
15,150:75e0:30:20:121 ¼ 15,260:23
This is the forward price of the Nikkei for a contract that provides a payoﬀin
dollars rather than yen. (As an approximation, it is also the futures price of such a
contract.)
Using Traditional Risk-Neutral Measures
The forward risk-neutral measure works well when payoﬀs occur at only one time. In
other situations, it is often more appropriate to use the traditional risk-neutral measure.
Suppose the process followed by a variable V in the traditional currency-Y risk-neutral
world is known and we wish to estimate its process in the traditional currency-X risk-
neutral world. Deﬁne:
S: Spot exchange rate (units of Y per unit of X)
S : Volatility of S
V : Volatility of V
: Instantaneous correlation between S and V.
In this case, the change of numeraire is from the money market account in currency Y
to the money market account in currency X (with both money market accounts being
denominated in currency X). Deﬁne gX as the value of the money market account in
currency X and gY as the value of the money market account in currency Y. The
numeraire ratio is
gXS=gY
722
CHAPTER 30

The variables gXðtÞ and gYðtÞ have a stochastic drift but zero volatility as explained in
Section 28.4. From Itoˆ ’s lemma it follows that the volatility of the numeraire ratio is S.
The change of numeraire therefore involves increasing the expected growth rate of V by
VS
ð30:7Þ
The market price of risk changes from zero to S. This result enables what is known as
Siegel’s paradox to be understood (see Business Snapshot 30.1).
Example 30.5
A 2-year American option provides a payoﬀof S  K pounds sterling where S is
the level of the S&P 500 at the time of exercise and K is the strike price. The
current level of the S&P 500 is 1,200. The risk-free interest rates in sterling and
dollars are both constant at 5% and 3%, respectively, the correlation between the
dollars/sterling exchange rate and the S&P 500 is 0.2, the volatility of the S&P 500
is 25%, and the volatility of the exchange rate is 12%. The dividend yield on the
S&P 500 is 1.5%.
Business Snapshot 30.1
Siegel’s Paradox
Consider two currencies, X and Y. Suppose that the interest rates in the two currencies,
rX and rY, are constant. Deﬁne S as the number of units of currency Y per unit of
currency X. As explained in Chapter 5, a currency is an asset that provides a yield at the
foreign risk-free rate. The traditional risk-neutral process for S is therefore
dS ¼ ðrY  rXÞS dt þ SS dz
From Itoˆ ’s lemma, this implies that the process for 1=S is
dð1=SÞ ¼ ðrX  rY þ 2
SÞð1=SÞ dt  Sð1=SÞ dz
This leads to what is known as Siegel’s paradox. Since the expected growth rate of S
is rY  rX in a risk-neutral world, symmetry suggests that the expected growth rate
of 1=S should be rX  rY rather than rX  rY þ 2
S.
To understand Siegel’s paradox it is necessary to appreciate that the process we
have given for S is the risk-neutral process for S in a world where the numeraire is the
money market account in currency Y. The process for 1=S, because it is deduced from
the process for S, therefore also assumes that this is the numeraire. Because 1=S is the
number of units of X per unit of Y, to be symmetrical we should measure the process
for 1=S in a world where the numeraire is the money market account in currency X.
Equation (30.7) shows that when we change the numeraire, from the money market
account in currency Y to the money market account in currency X, the growth rate of
a variable V increases by VS, where  is the correlation between S and V. In this
case, V ¼ 1=S, so that  ¼ 1 and V ¼ S. It follows that the change of numeraire
causes the growth rate of 1=S to increase by 2
S. This neutralizes the þ2
S in the
process given above for 1=S. The process for 1=S in a world where the numeraire is
the money market account in currency X is therefore
dð1=SÞ ¼ ðrX  rYÞð1=SÞ dt  Sð1=SÞ dz
This is symmetrical with the process we started with for S. The paradox is resolved!
Convexity, Timing, and Quanto Adjustments
723

This option can be valued by constructing a binomial tree for the S&P 500
using as the numeraire the money market account in the UK (i.e., using the
traditional risk-neutral world as seen from the perspective of a UK investor).
From equation (30.7), the change in numeraire from the US to UK money market
account leads to an increase in the expected growth rate in the S&P 500 of
0:2  0:25  0:12 ¼ 0:006
or 0.6%. The growth rate of the S&P 500 using a US dollar numeraire is
3%  1:5% ¼ 1:5%. The growth rate using the sterling numeraire is therefore
2.1%. The risk-free interest rate in sterling is 5%. The S&P 500 therefore behaves
like an asset providing a dividend yield of 5%  2:1% ¼ 2:9% under the sterling
numeraire. Using the parameter values of S ¼ 1,200, K ¼ 1,200, r ¼ 0:05,
q ¼ 0:029,  ¼ 0:25, and T ¼ 2 with 100 time steps, DerivaGem estimates the
value of the option as £179.83.
SUMMARY
When valuing a derivative providing a payoﬀat a particular future time it is natural to
assume that the variables underlying the derivative equal their forward values and
discount at the rate of interest applicable from the valuation date to the payoﬀdate.
This chapter has shown that this is not always the correct procedure.
When a payoﬀdepends on a bond yield y observed at time T the expected yield
should be assumed to be higher than the forward yield as indicated by equation (30.1).
This result can be adapted for situations where a payoﬀdepends on a swap rate. When
a variable is observed at time T but the payoﬀoccurs at a later time T  the forward
value of the variable should be adjusted as indicated by equation (30.4). When a
variable is observed in one currency but leads to a payoﬀin another currency the
forward value of the variable should also be adjusted. In this case the adjustment is
shown in equation (30.6).
These results will be used when nonstandard swaps are considered in Chapter 33.

Practice Questions (Answers in Solutions Manual)
30.1. Explain how you would value a derivative that pays oﬀ100R in 5 years, where R is the
1-year interest rate (annually compounded) observed in 4 years. What diﬀerence would it
make if the payoﬀwere in (a) 4 years and (b) 6 years?
724
CHAPTER 30

30.2. Explain whether any convexity or timing adjustments are necessary when:
(a) We wish to value a spread option that pays oﬀevery quarter the excess (if any) of the
5-year swap rate over the 3-month LIBOR rate applied to a principal of $100. The
payoﬀoccurs 90 days after the rates are observed.
(b) We wish to value a derivative that pays oﬀevery quarter the 3-month LIBOR rate
minus the 3-month Treasury bill rate. The payoﬀoccurs 90 days after the rates are
observed.
30.3. Suppose that in Example 29.3 of Section 29.2 the payoﬀoccurs after 1 year (i.e., when
the interest rate is observed) rather than in 15 months. What diﬀerence does this make to
the inputs to Black’s model?
30.4. The LIBOR/swap yield curve (used for discounting) is ﬂat at 10% per annum with annual
compounding. Calculate the value of an instrument where, in 5 years’ time, the 2-year
swap rate (with annual compounding) is received and a ﬁxed rate of 10% is paid. Both are
applied to a notional principal of $100. Assume that the volatility of the swap rate is 20%
per annum. Explain why the value of the instrument is diﬀerent from zero.
30.5. What diﬀerence does it make in Problem 30.4 if the swap rate is observed in 5 years, but
the exchange of payments takes place in (a) 6 years, and (b) 7 years? Assume that the
volatilities of all forward rates are 20%. Assume also that the forward swap rate for the
period between years 5 and 7 has a correlation of 0.8 with the forward interest rate
between years 5 and 6 and a correlation of 0.95 with the forward interest rate between
years 5 and 7.
30.6. The price of a bond at time T, measured in terms of its yield, is GðyTÞ. Assume geometric
Brownian motion for the forward bond yield y in a world that is forward risk neutral
with respect to a bond maturing at time T. Suppose that the growth rate of the forward
bond yield is  and its volatility y.
(a) Use Itoˆ ’s lemma to calculate the process for the forward bond price in terms of ,
y, y, and GðyÞ.
(b) The forward bond price should follow a martingale in the world considered. Use
this fact to calculate an expression for .
(c) Show that the expression for  is, to a ﬁrst approximation, consistent with
equation (30.1).
30.7. The variable S is an investment asset providing income at rate q measured in currency A.
It follows the process
dS ¼ SS dt þ SS dz
in the real world. Deﬁning new variables as necessary, give the process followed by S,
and the corresponding market price of risk, in:
(a) A world that is the traditional risk-neutral world for currency A
(b) A world that is the traditional risk-neutral world for currency B
(c) A world that is forward risk neutral with respect to a zero-coupon currency A bond
maturing at time T
(d) A world that is forward risk neutral with respect to a zero-coupon currency B bond
maturing at time T.
30.8. A call option provides a payoﬀat time T of maxðST  K; 0Þ yen, where ST is the dollar
price of gold at time T and K is the strike price. Assuming that the storage costs of gold
are zero and deﬁning other variables as necessary, calculate the value of the contract.

30.9. A Canadian equity index is 400. The Canadian dollar is currently worth 0.70 US dollars.
The risk-free interest rates in Canada and the US are constant at 6% and 4%,
respectively. The dividend yield on the index is 3%. Deﬁne Q as the number of Canadian
dollars per U.S dollar and S as the value of the index. The volatility of S is 20%, the
volatility of Q is 6%, and the correlation between S and Q is 0.4. Use DerivaGem to
determine the value of a 2-year American-style call option on the index if:
(a) It pays oﬀin Canadian dollars the amount by which the index exceeds 400.
(b) It pays oﬀin US dollars the amount by which the index exceeds 400.
Further Questions
30.10. Consider an instrument that will pay oﬀS dollars in 2 years, where S is the value of the
Nikkei index. The index is currently 20,000. The yen/dollar exchange rate is 100 (yen per
dollar). The correlation between the exchange rate and the index is 0.3 and the dividend
yield on the index is 1% per annum. The volatility of the Nikkei index is 20% and the
volatility of the yen/dollar exchange rate is 12%. The interest rates (assumed constant) in
the US and Japan are 4% and 2%, respectively.
(a) What is the value of the instrument?
(b) Suppose that the exchange rate at some point during the life of the instrument is Q
and the level of the index is S. Show that a US investor can create a portfolio that
changes in value by approximately S dollar when the index changes in value by
S yen by investing S dollars in the Nikkei and shorting SQ yen.
(c) Conﬁrm that this is correct by supposing that the index changes from 20,000
to 20,050 and the exchange rate changes from 100 to 99.7.
(d) How would you delta hedge the instrument under consideration?
30.11. Suppose that the LIBOR yield curve is ﬂat at 8% (with continuous compounding). The
payoﬀfrom a derivative occurs in 4 years. It is equal to the 5-year rate minus the 2-year
rate at this time, applied to a principal of $100 with both rates being continuously
compounded. (The payoﬀcan be positive or negative.) Calculate the value of the
derivative. Assume that the volatility for all rates is 25%. What diﬀerence does it make
if the payoﬀoccurs in 5 years instead of 4 years? Assume all rates are perfectly
correlated. Use LIBOR discounting.
30.12. Suppose that the payoﬀfrom a derivative will occur in 10 years and will equal the 3-year
US dollar swap rate for a semiannual-pay swap observed at that time applied to a certain
principal. Assume that the swap yield curve (used for discounting) is ﬂat at 8%
(semiannually compounded) per annum in dollars and 3% (semiannually compounded)
in yen. The forward swap rate volatility is 18%, the volatility of the 10-year ‘‘yen per
dollar’’ forward exchange rate is 12%, and the correlation between this exchange rate
and US dollar interest rates is 0.25. What is the value of the derivative if (a) the swap rate
is applied to a principal of $100 with a dollar payoﬀand (b) it is applied to 100 million
yen with a yen payoﬀ?”
30.13. The payoﬀfrom a derivative will occur in 8 years. It will equal the average of the 1-year
risk-free interest rates observed at times 5, 6, 7, and 8 years applied to a principal of
$1,000. The risk-free yield curve is ﬂat at 6% with annual compounding and the
volatilities of all rates are 16%. Assume perfect correlation between all rates. What is
the value of the derivative?

CHAPTER 30

APPENDIX
PROOF OF THE CONVEXITY ADJUSTMENT FORMULA
This appendix calculates a convexity adjustment for forward bond yields. Suppose
that the payoﬀfrom a derivative at time T depends on a bond yield observed at that
time. Deﬁne:
y0: Forward bond yield observed today for a forward contract with maturity T
yT : Bond yield at time T
BT : Price of the bond at time T
y: Volatility of the forward bond yield.
Suppose that
BT ¼ GðyTÞ
Expanding GðyTÞ in a Taylor series about yT ¼ y0 yields the following approximation:
BT ¼ Gðy0Þ þ ðyT  y0ÞG0ðy0Þ þ 0:5ðyT  y0Þ2G00ðy0Þ
where G0 and G00 are the ﬁrst and second partial derivatives of G. Taking expectations
in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to a zero-coupon bond maturing at
time T gives
ETðBTÞ ¼ Gðy0Þ þ ETðyT  y0ÞG0ðy0Þ þ 1
2ET½ðyT  y0Þ2G00ðy0Þ
where ET denotes expectations in this world. The expression Gðy0Þ is by deﬁnition the
forward bond price. Also, because of the particular world we are working in, ETðBTÞ
equals the forward bond price. Hence ETðBTÞ ¼ Gðy0Þ, so that
ETðyT  y0ÞG0ðy0Þ þ 1
2ET½ðyT  y0Þ2G00ðy0Þ ¼ 0
The expression ET½ðyT  y0Þ2 is approximately 2

that
ETðyTÞ ¼ y0  1

Interest Rate
Derivatives:
Models of the
Short Rate
The models for pricing interest rate options that we have presented so far make the
assumption that the probability distribution of an interest rate, a bond price, or some
other variable at a future point in time is lognormal. They are widely used for valuing
instruments such as caps, European bond options, and European swap options.
However, they have limitations. They do not provide a description of how interest rates
evolve through time. Consequently, they cannot be used for valuing interest rate
derivatives that are American-style or structured notes.
This chapter and the next discuss alternative approaches for overcoming these limita-
tions. These involve building what is known as a term structure model. This is a model
describing the evolution of all zero-coupon interest rates.1 This chapter focuses on term
structure models constructed by specifying the behavior of the short-term interest rate, r.
This chapter is concerned with modeling a single risk-free zero curve. The trend
toward OIS discounting, discussed in Chapter 9, means that it is often necessary to
model two zero curves simultaneously. The models in this chapter are then applied to
the OIS rate and a separate model of the spread between OIS and LIBOR rates is
developed. Section 32.3 discusses how this can be done.
31.1
BACKGROUND
The risk-free short rate, r, at time t is the rate that applies to an inﬁnitesimally short
period of time at time t. It is sometimes referred to as the instantaneous short rate. Bond
prices, option prices, and other derivative prices depend only on the process followed by r
in a risk-neutral world. The process for r in the real world is not used. As explained in
Chapter 28, the traditional risk-neutral world is a world where, in a very short time
period between t and t þ t, investors earn on average rðtÞt. All processes for r that will
be considered in this chapter, except where otherwise stated, are processes in this risk-
neutral world.
1 An advantage of term structure models is that the convexity and timing adjustments discussed in the
previous chapter are not required.

C H A P T E R

From equation (28.19), the value at time t of an interest rate derivative that provides a
payoﬀof fT at time T is
^E½erðTtÞfT
ð31:1Þ
where r is the average value of r in the time interval between t and T, and ^E denotes
expected value in the traditional risk-neutral world.
As usual, deﬁne Pðt; TÞ as the price at time t of a risk-free zero-coupon bond that pays
oﬀ$1 at time T. From equation (31.1),
Pðt; TÞ ¼ ^E½erðTtÞ
ð31:2Þ
If Rðt; TÞ is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate at time t for a term of
T  t, then
Pðt; TÞ ¼ eRðt;TÞðTtÞ
so that
Rðt; TÞ ¼ 
1
T  t ln Pðt; TÞ
ð31:3Þ
and, from equation (31.2),
Rðt; TÞ ¼ 
1
T  t ln ^E½erðTtÞ
ð31:4Þ
This equation enables the term structure of interest rates at any given time to be
obtained from the value of r at that time and the risk-neutral process for r. It shows
that, once the process for r has been deﬁned, everything about the initial zero curve and
its evolution through time can be determined.
Suppose r follows the general process
dr ¼ mðr; tÞ dt þ sðr; tÞ dz
From Itoˆ ’s lemma, any derivative dependent on r follows the process
df ¼
@f
@t þ m @f
@r þ 1
2s2 @f
@r2

dt þ s @f
@r dz
Because we are working in the traditional risk-neutral world, if the derivative provides
no income, this process must have the form
df ¼ rf dt þ   
so that
@f
@t þ m @f
@r þ 1
2s2 @f
@r2 ¼ rf
ð31:5Þ
This is the equivalent of the Black–Scholes–Merton diﬀerential equation for interest
rate derivatives. One particular solution to the equation must be the zero-coupon bond
price Pðt; TÞ.
31.2
EQUILIBRIUM MODELS
Equilibrium models usually start with assumptions about economic variables and
derive a process for the short rate, r. They then explore what the process for r implies
about bond prices and option prices.
Interest Rate Derivatives: Models of the Short Rate
729

In a one-factor equilibrium model, the process for r involves only one source of
uncertainty. Usually the risk-neutral process for the short rate is described by an Itoˆ
process of the form
dr ¼ mðrÞ dt þ sðrÞ dz
The instantaneous drift, m, and instantaneous standard deviation, s, are assumed to
be functions of r, but are independent of time. The assumption of a single factor is
not as restrictive as it might appear. A one-factor model implies that all rates move in
the same direction over any short time interval, but not that they all move by the same
amount. The shape of the zero curve can therefore change with the passage of time.
This section considers three one-factor equilibrium models:
mðrÞ ¼ r; sðrÞ ¼ r
(Rendleman and Bartter model)
mðrÞ ¼ aðb  rÞ; sðrÞ ¼ 
(Vasicek model)
mðrÞ ¼ aðb  rÞ; sðrÞ ¼ 
ﬃﬃr
p
(Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model)
The Rendleman and Bartter Model
In Rendleman and Bartter’s model, the risk-neutral process for r is2
dr ¼ r dt þ r dz
where  and  are constants. This means that r follows geometric Brownian motion. The
process for r is of the same type as that assumed for a stock price in Chapter 15. It can be
represented using a binomial tree similar to the one used for stocks in Chapter 13.3
The assumption that the short-term interest rate behaves like a stock price is a natural
starting point but is less than ideal. One important diﬀerence between interest rates and
stock prices is that interest rates appear to be pulled back to some long-run average level
over time. This phenomenon is known as mean reversion. When r is high, mean
reversion tends to cause it to have a negative drift; when r is low, mean reversion tends
to cause it to have a positive drift. Mean reversion is illustrated in Figure 31.1. The
Rendleman and Bartter model does not incorporate mean reversion.
There are compelling economic arguments in favor of mean reversion. When rates are
high, the economy tends to slow down and there is low demand for funds from
borrowers. As a result, rates decline. When rates are low, there tends to be a high demand
for funds on the part of borrowers and rates tend to rise.
The Vasicek Model
In Vasicek’s model, the risk-neutral process for r is
dr ¼ aðb  rÞ dt þ  dz
where a, b, and  are nonnegative constants.4 This model incorporates mean reversion.

Quantitative Analysis, 15 (March 1980): 11–24.
3 The way that the interest rate tree is used is explained later in the chapter.

Economics, 5 (1977): 177–88.
730
CHAPTER 31

The short rate is pulled to a level b at rate a. Superimposed upon this ‘‘pull’’ is a
normally distributed stochastic term  dz.
Zero-coupon bond prices in Vasicek’s model are given by

When a ¼ 0, Bðt; TÞ ¼ T  t and Aðt; TÞ ¼ exp½2ðT  tÞ3=6.

Interest Rate Derivatives: Models of the Short Rate
731

The Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross Model
Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR) have proposed the following alternative model:5
dr ¼ aðb  rÞ dt þ 
ﬃﬃr
p dz
where a, b, and  are nonnegative constants. This has the same mean-reverting drift as
Vasicek, but the standard deviation of the change in the short rate in a short period of
time is proportional to
ﬃﬃr
p . This means that, as the short-term interest rate increases, the
standard deviation increases.
Bond prices in the CIR model have the same general form as those in Vasicek’s
model,
Pðt; TÞ ¼ Aðt; TÞeBðt;TÞrðtÞ
but the functions Bðt; TÞ and Aðt; TÞ are diﬀerent:
Bðt; TÞ ¼

To see this result, we substitute m ¼ aðb  rÞ and s ¼ 

into diﬀerential equa-
tion (31.5) to get

As in the case of Vasicek’s model, we can prove the bond-pricing result by substituting
f ¼ Aðt; TÞeBðt;TÞr into the diﬀerential equation. In this case, Aðt; TÞ and Bðt; TÞ are
solutions of
Bt  aB  1
22B2 þ 1 ¼ 0;
At  abAB ¼ 0
Furthermore, the boundary condition PðT; TÞ ¼ 1 is satisﬁed.
Properties of Vasicek and CIR
The Aðt; TÞ and Bðt; TÞ functions are diﬀerent for Vasicek and CIR, but for both
models

so that

732
CHAPTER 31

This shows that the entire term structure at time t can be determined as a function of
rðtÞ once a, b, and  have been chosen. The rate Rðt; TÞ is linearly dependent on rðtÞ.6
This means that the value of rðtÞ determines the level of the term structure at time t. The
shape of the term structure at time t is independent of rðtÞ, but does depend on t. As
shown in Figure 31.2, the shape at a particular time can be upward sloping, downward
sloping, or slightly ‘‘humped.’’
In Chapter 4, we saw that the modiﬁed duration D of a bond or other instrument
dependent on interest rates, which has a price of Q, is deﬁned by
Q
Q ¼ D y
where y denotes the size of a parallel shift in the yield curve. An alternative duration
measure
^D, which can be used in conjunction with Vasicek or CIR, is deﬁned as
Figure 31.2
Possible shapes of term structure in the Vasicek and CIR models.
6 Some researchers have developed two-factor equilibrium models that give a richer set of possible
movements in the term structure than either Vasicek or CIR. See, for example, F. A. Longstaﬀand E. S.

When Q is the zero-coupon bond, Pðt; TÞ, equation (31.9) shows that ^D ¼ Bðt; TÞ.
Example 31.1
Consider a zero-coupon bond lasting 4 years. In this case, D ¼ 4, so that a 10-basis-
point (0.1%) parallel shift in the term structure leads to a decrease of approximately
0:4% in the bond price. If Vasicek’s model is used with a ¼ 0:1,
^D ¼ Bð0; 4Þ ¼ ð1  e0:14Þ
0:1
¼ 3:30
This means that a 10-basis-point increase in the short rate leads to a decrease in
the bond price that is approximately 0.33%. The sensitivity of the bond price to
movements in the short rate is less than to parallel shifts in the zero curve because
of the impact of mean reversion.
When Q is a portfolio of n zero-coupon bonds, Pðt; TiÞ ð1 6 i 6 nÞ, and ci is the
principal of the ith bond, we have

where ^Di is the ^D for Pðt; TiÞ. This shows that the ^D for a coupon-bearing bond can be
calculated as a weighted average of the
^D’s for the underlying zero-coupon bonds,
similarly to the way the usual duration measure D is calculated (see Table 4.6).
A convexity measure for Vasicek and CIR can be deﬁned similarly to the duration
measure (see Problem 31.21).
The expected growth rate of Pðt; TÞ in the traditional risk-neutral world at time t is
rðtÞ because Pðt; TÞ is the price of a traded security. Since Pðt; TÞ is a function of rðtÞ,
the coeﬃcient of dzðtÞ in the process for Pðt; TÞ can be calculated from Itoˆ ’s lemma as
 @Pðt; TÞ=@rðtÞ for Vasicek and 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

@Pðt; TÞ=@rðtÞ for CIR. Substituting from
equation (31.9), the processes for Pðt; TÞ in a risk-neutral world are therefore

To compare the term structure of interest rates given by Vasicek and CIR for a
particular value of r, it makes sense to use the same a and b. However, the Vasicek ,
vas, should be chosen to be approximately equal to the CIR , cir, times

www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/VasicekCIR. Under Vasicek, r can become negative.
This is not possible under CIR.7
7 In CIR, when interest rates get close to zero, the variability of interest rates becomes very small. In all
circumstances, negative interest rates are not possible. Zero interest rates are not possible when 2ab > 2.

CHAPTER 31

Applications of Equilibrium Models
As will be discussed in the next section, when derivatives are being valued it is
important that the model used provides an exact ﬁt to the current term structure of
interest rates. However, when a Monte Carlo simulation is being carried out over a
long period of time for the purposes of scenario analysis, the equilibrium models
discussed in this section can be useful tools. A pension fund or insurance company
that is interested in the value of its portfolio in 20 years is likely to feel that the precise
shape of the current term structure of interest rates has relatively little bearing on its
risks.
Once one of the models we have discussed has been chosen, one approach is to
determine the parameters from past movements in the short-term interest rate. (The
1-month or 3-month rate can be used as a proxy for the short-term rate.) Data can be
collected on daily, weekly, or monthly changes in the short rate and parameters can be
estimated either by regressing r against r (see Example 31.2) or by using maximum-
likelihood methods (see Problem 31.13). Another approach is to collect data on the
prices of bonds and use an application such as Solver in Excel to determine the values
of a, b, and  that minimize the sums of squares of the diﬀerence between the market
prices of bonds and their model prices.
There is an important diﬀerence between the two approaches. The ﬁrst approach
(ﬁtting historical data) provides parameter estimates in the real world. The second
approach (ﬁtting bond prices) provides parameter estimates in the risk-neutral world.
When carrying out a scenario analysis, we are interested in modeling the behavior of the
short rate in the real world. However, we are also likely to be interested in knowing the
complete term structure of interest rates at diﬀerent times during the life of the Monte
Carlo simulation. For this we need risk-neutral parameter estimates.
When we move from the real world to the risk-neutral world, the volatility of the
short rate does not change, but the drift does. To determine the change in the drift, it is
necessary to make an estimate of the market price of interest rate risk. Ahmad and
Wilmott do this by comparing the slope of the zero-coupon yield curve with the real-
world drift of the short-term interest rate.8 Their estimate of the long-term average
market price of interest rate risk for US interest rates is about 1.2. There is a
considerable variation in their estimate of the market price of interest rate risk through
time. During stressed market conditions, when the ‘‘fear factor’’ is high (for example,
during the 2007–2009 credit crisis), the market price of interest rate risk was found to be
a much larger negative number than 1.2.
Example 31.2
Suppose that the discrete version of Vasicek’s model
r ¼ aðb  rÞt þ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t
p
is used to ﬁt weekly data on a short-term interest rate over a period of 10 years for
the purposes of a Monte Carlo simulation. Assume that when r (the change in
the short rate in 1 week) is regressed against r, the slope is 0:004, the intercept is
0.00016, and the standard error of the estimate is 0.001. In this case, t ¼ 1=52,
so that a=52 ¼ 0:004, ab=52 ¼ 0:00016, and =
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
52
p
¼ 0:001. This means that

and Greed in the Fixed-Income Markets,’’ Wilmott, January 2007, 64–70.

735

a ¼ 0:21, b ¼ 0:04, and  ¼ 0:0072. (These parameters indicate that the short rate
reverts to 4.0% with a reversion rate of 21%. The volatility of the short rate at any
given time is 0.72% divided by the short rate.) The short rate can then be
simulated in the real world.
To determine the risk-neutral process for r, we note that the proportional drift
of r is aðb  rÞ=r and its volatility is =r. From the results in Chapter 28, the
proportional drift reduces by =r when we move from the real world to the risk-
neutral world where  is the market price of interest rate risk. The process for r in
the risk-neutral world is therefore
dr ¼ ½aðb  rÞ   dt þ  dz
or
dr ¼ ½aðb  rÞ dt þ  dz
where
b ¼ b  =a
Given the Ahmad and Wilmott results, we might choose to set  ¼ 1:2, so that
b ¼ 0:04 þ 1:2  0:01=0:2 ¼ 0:1. Equations (31.6) to (31.8) (with b ¼ b) can
then be used to determine the complete term structure of interest rates at any
point during the Monte Carlo simulation.
Example 31.3
The Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model
dr ¼ aðb  rÞ dt þ 
ﬃﬃr
p dz
can be used to value bonds of any maturity using the model’s analytic results.
Suppose that the values of a, b, and  that minimize the sum of the squared
diﬀerences between the market prices of a set of bonds and the prices given by the
model are a ¼ 0:15, b ¼ 0:06, and  ¼ 0:05. These values of the parameters give a
best-ﬁt risk-neutral process for the short-term interest rate. In this case, the pro-
portional drift in the short rate is aðb  rÞ=r and the volatility of the short rate
=
ﬃﬃr
p . From the results in Chapter 28, the proportional drift increases by =
ﬃﬃr
p
when we move from the risk-neutral world to the real world where  is the market
price of interest rate risk. The real-world process for r is therefore
dr ¼ ½aðb  rÞ þ 
ﬃﬃr
p  dt þ 
ﬃﬃr
p dz
This can be used to simulate the process for the short rate in the real world.9 At
any given time longer rates can be determined using the risk-neutral process and
analytic results. As before, we might choose to set  ¼ 1:2.
31.3
NO-ARBITRAGE MODELS
The disadvantage of the equilibrium models we have presented is that they do not
automatically ﬁt today’s term structure of interest rates. By choosing the parameters
judiciously, they can be made to provide an approximate ﬁt to many of the term
structures that are encountered in practice. But the ﬁt is not an exact one. Most traders

convenient to assume that  is proportional to

p , so as to preserve the functional form for the drift.
736
CHAPTER 31

ﬁnd this unsatisfactory. Not unreasonably, they argue that they can have very little
conﬁdence in the price of a bond option when the model used does not price the
underlying bond correctly. A 1% error in the price of the underlying bond may lead to
a 25% error in an option price.
A no-arbitrage model is a model designed to be exactly consistent with today’s term
structure of interest rates. The essential diﬀerence between an equilibrium and a no-
arbitrage model is therefore as follows. In an equilibrium model, today’s term structure
of interest rates is an output. In a no-arbitrage model, today’s term structure of interest
rates is an input.
In an equilibrium model, the drift of the short rate (i.e., the coeﬃcient of dt) is not
usually a function of time. In a no-arbitrage model, the drift is, in general, dependent
on time. This is because the shape of the initial zero curve governs the average path
taken by the short rate in the future in a no-arbitrage model. If the zero curve is steeply
upward-sloping for maturities between t1 and t2, then r has a positive drift between
these times; if it is steeply downward-sloping for these maturities, then r has a negative
drift between these times.
It turns out that some equilibrium models can be converted to no-arbitrage models
by including a function of time in the drift of the short rate. We now consider the Ho–
Lee, Hull–White (one- and two-factor), Black–Derman–Toy, and Black–Karasinski
models.
The Ho–Lee Model
Ho and Lee proposed the ﬁrst no-arbitrage model of the term structure in a paper in
1986.10 They presented the model in the form of a binomial tree of bond prices with
two parameters: the short-rate standard deviation and the market price of risk of the
short rate. It has since been shown that the continuous-time limit of the model in the
traditional risk-neutral world is
dr ¼ ðtÞ dt þ  dz
ð31:10Þ
where , the instantaneous standard deviation of the short rate, is constant and ðtÞ is a
function of time chosen to ensure that the model ﬁts the initial term structure. The
variable ðtÞ deﬁnes the average direction that r moves at time t. This is independent of
the level of r. Ho and Lee’s parameter that concerns the market price of risk is
irrelevant when the model is used to price interest rate derivatives.
Technical Note 31 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes shows that
ðtÞ ¼ Ftð0; tÞ þ 2t
ð31:11Þ
where Fð0; tÞ is the instantaneous forward rate for a maturity t as seen at time zero and
the subscript t denotes a partial derivative with respect to t. As an approximation, ðtÞ
equals Ftð0; tÞ. This means that the average direction that the short rate will be moving in
the future is approximately equal to the slope of the instantaneous forward curve. The
Ho–Lee model is illustrated in Figure 31.3. Superimposed on the average movement in
the short rate is the normally distributed random outcome.

Technical Note 31 also shows that
Pðt; TÞ ¼ Aðt; TÞerðtÞðTtÞ
ð31:12Þ
where
ln Aðt; TÞ ¼ ln Pð0; TÞ
Pð0; tÞ þ ðT  tÞFð0; tÞ  1
22tðT  tÞ2
From Section 4.6, Fð0; tÞ ¼ @ ln Pð0; tÞ=@t. The zero-coupon bond prices, Pð0; tÞ, are
known for all t from today’s term structure of interest rates. Equation (31.12) therefore
gives the price of a zero-coupon bond at a future time t in terms of the short rate at
time t and the prices of bonds today.
The Hull–White (One-Factor) Model
In a paper published in 1990, Hull and White explored extensions of the Vasicek model
that provide an exact ﬁt to the initial term structure.11 One version of the extended
Vasicek model that they consider is
dr ¼ ½ðtÞ  ar dt þ  dz
ð31:13Þ
or
dr ¼ a
ðtÞ

where a and  are constants. This is known as the Hull–White model. It can be
characterized as the Ho–Lee model with mean reversion at rate a. Alternatively, it

CHAPTER 31

can be characterized as the Vasicek model with a time-dependent reversion level. At
time t, the short rate reverts to ðtÞ=a at rate a. The Ho–Lee model is a particular case of
the Hull–White model with a ¼ 0.
The model has the same amount of analytic tractability as Ho–Lee. Technical Note 31
shows that
ðtÞ ¼ Ftð0; tÞ þ aFð0; tÞ þ 2
2a ð1  e2atÞ
ð31:14Þ
The last term in this equation is usually fairly small. If we ignore it, the equation implies
that the drift of the process for r at time t is Ftð0; tÞ þ a½Fð0; tÞ  r. This shows that, on
average, r follows the slope of the initial instantaneous forward rate curve. When it
deviates from that curve, it reverts back to it at rate a. The model is illustrated in
Figure 31.4.
Technical Note 31 shows that bond prices at time t in the Hull–White model are
given by

form of a trinomial tree is given later in this chapter. This is useful when American
options and other derivatives that cannot be valued analytically are considered.
The Black–Derman–Toy Model
In 1990, Black, Derman, and Toy proposed a binomial-tree model for a lognormal
short-rate process.12 Their procedure for building the binomial tree is explained in
Technical Note 23 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes. It can be
shown that the stochastic process corresponding to the model is
d ln r ¼ ½ðtÞ  aðtÞ ln r dt þ ðtÞ dz
with
aðtÞ ¼  0ðtÞ
ðtÞ
where 0ðtÞ is the derivative of  with respect to t. This model has the advantage over
Ho–Lee and Hull–White that the interest rate cannot become negative. The Wiener
process dz can cause lnðrÞ to be negative, but r itself is always positive. One disadvan-
tage of the model is that there are no analytic properties. A more serious disadvantage
is that the way the tree is constructed imposes a relationship between the volatility
parameter ðtÞ and the reversion rate parameter aðtÞ. The reversion rate is positive only
if the volatility of the short rate is a decreasing function of time.
In practice, the most useful version of the model is when ðtÞ is constant. The
parameter a is then zero, so that there is no mean reversion and the model reduces to
d ln r ¼ ðtÞ dt þ  dz
This can be characterized as a lognormal version of the Ho–Lee model.
The Black–Karasinski Model
In 1991, Black and Karasinski developed an extension of the Black–Derman–Toy
model where the reversion rate and volatility are determined independently of each
other.13 The most general version of the model is
d ln r ¼ ½ðtÞ  aðtÞ ln r dt þ ðtÞ dz
The model is the same as Black–Derman–Toy model except that there is no relation
between aðtÞ and ðtÞ. In practice, aðtÞ and ðtÞ are often assumed to be constant, so that
the model becomes
d ln r ¼ ½ðtÞ  a ln r dt þ  dz
ð31:18Þ
As in the case of all the models we are considering, the ðtÞ function is determined to
provide an exact ﬁt to the initial term structure of interest rates. The model has no
analytic tractability, but later in this chapter we will describe a convenient way of

CHAPTER 31

simultaneously determining ðtÞ and representing the process for r in the form of a
trinomial tree.
The Hull–White Two-Factor Model
Hull and White have developed a two-factor model:14
dfðrÞ ¼ ½ðtÞ þ u  afðrÞ dt þ 1 dz1
ð31:19Þ
where fðrÞ is a function of r and u has an initial value of zero and follows the process
du ¼ bu dt þ 2 dz2
As in the one-factor models just considered, the parameter ðtÞ is chosen to make the
model consistent with the initial term structure. The stochastic variable u is a com-
ponent of the reversion level of fðrÞ and itself reverts to a level of zero at rate b. The
parameters a, b, 1, and 2 are constants and dz1 and dz2 are Wiener processes with
instantaneous correlation .
This model provides a richer pattern of term structure movements and a richer
pattern of volatilities than one-factor models of r. For more information on the
analytical properties of the model and the way a tree can be constructed for it, see
Technical Note 14 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes.
31.4
OPTIONS ON BONDS
Some of the models just presented allow options on zero-coupon bonds to be valued
analytically. For the Vasicek, Ho–Lee, and Hull–White one-factor models, the price at
time zero of a call option that matures at time T on a zero-coupon bond maturing at
time s is
LPð0; sÞNðhÞ  KPð0; TÞNðh  PÞ

Equation (31.20) is essentially the same as Black’s model for pricing bond options in

. As explained in
Section 29.2, an interest rate cap or ﬂoor can be expressed as a portfolio of options on
zero-coupon bonds. It can, therefore, be valued analytically using the equations just
presented.
There are also formulas for valuing options on zero-coupon bonds in the Cox,
Ingersoll, and Ross model, which we presented in Section 31.2. These involve integrals
of the noncentral chi-square distribution.
Options on Coupon-Bearing Bonds
In a one-factor model of r, all zero-coupon bonds move up in price when r decreases
and all zero-coupon bonds move down in price when r increases. As a result, a one-
factor model allows a European option on a coupon-bearing bond to be expressed as
the sum of European options on zero-coupon bonds. The procedure is as follows:
1. Calculate r, the critical value of r for which the price of the coupon-bearing bond
equals the strike price of the option on the bond at the option maturity T.
2. Calculate prices of European options with maturity T on the zero-coupon bonds
that comprise the coupon-bearing bond. The strike prices of the options equal the
values the zero-coupon bonds will have at time T when r ¼ r.
3. Set the price of the European option on the coupon-bearing bond equal to the
sum of the prices on the options on zero-coupon bonds calculated in Step 2.
This allows options on coupon-bearing bonds to be valued for the Vasicek, Cox,
Ingersoll, and Ross, Ho–Lee, and Hull–White models. As explained in Business Snap-
shot 29.2, a European swap option can be viewed as an option on a coupon-bearing
bond. It can, therefore, be valued using this procedure. For more details on the procedure
and a numerical example, see Technical Note 15 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/
TechnicalNotes.
31.5
VOLATILITY STRUCTURES
The models we have looked at give rise to diﬀerent volatility environments. Figure 31.5
shows the volatility of the 3-month forward rate as a function of maturity for Ho–Lee,
Hull–White one-factor and Hull–White two-factor models. The term structure of
interest rates is assumed to be ﬂat.
For Ho–Lee the volatility of the 3-month forward rate is the same for all maturities.
In the one-factor Hull–White model the eﬀect of mean reversion is to cause the
volatility of the 3-month forward rate to be a declining function of maturity. In the
Hull–White two-factor model when parameters are chosen appropriately, the volatility
of the 3-month forward rate has a ‘‘humped’’ look. The latter is consistent with
empirical evidence and implied cap volatilities discussed in Section 29.2.
742
CHAPTER 31

31.6
INTEREST RATE TREES
An interest rate tree is a discrete-time representation of the stochastic process for the
short rate in much the same way as a stock price tree is a discrete-time representation of
the process followed by a stock price. If the time step on the tree is t, the rates on the
tree are the continuously compounded t-period rates. The usual assumption when a
tree is constructed is that the t-period rate, R, follows the same stochastic process as
the instantaneous rate, r, in the corresponding continuous-time model. The main
diﬀerence between interest rate trees and stock price trees is in the way that discounting
is done. In a stock price tree, the discount rate is usually assumed to be the same at each
node or a function of time. In an interest rate tree, the discount rate varies from node to
node.
It often proves to be convenient to use a trinomial rather than a binomial tree for
interest rates. The main advantage of a trinomial tree is that it provides an extra degree
of freedom, making it easier for the tree to represent features of the interest rate process
such as mean reversion. As mentioned in Section 21.8, using a trinomial tree is
equivalent to using the explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method.
Illustration of Use of Trinomial Trees
To illustrate how trinomial interest rate trees are used to value derivatives, consider the
simple example shown in Figure 31.6. This is a two-step tree with each time step equal
to 1 year in length so that t ¼ 1 year. Assume that the up, middle, and down

probabilities are 0.25, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively, at each node. The assumed t-period
rate is shown as the upper number at each node.15
The tree is used to value a derivative that provides a payoﬀat the end of the second
time step of
max½100ðR  0:11Þ; 0
where R is the t-period rate. The calculated value of this derivative is the lower
number at each node. At the ﬁnal nodes, the value of the derivative equals the payoﬀ.
For example, at node E, the value is 100  ð0:14  0:11Þ ¼ 3. At earlier nodes, the value
of the derivative is calculated using the rollback procedure explained in Chapters 13
and 21. At node B, the 1-year interest rate is 12%. This is used for discounting to obtain
the value of the derivative at node B from its values at nodes E, F, and G as
½0:25  3 þ 0:5  1 þ 0:25  0e0:121 ¼ 1:11
At node C, the 1-year interest rate is 10%. This is used for discounting to obtain the
value of the derivative at node C as
ð0:25  1 þ 0:5  0 þ 0:25  0Þe0:11 ¼ 0:23
At the initial node, A, the interest rate is also 10% and the value of the derivative is
ð0:25  1:11 þ 0:5  0:23 þ 0:25  0Þe0:11 ¼ 0:35
Nonstandard Branching
It sometimes proves convenient to modify the standard trinomial branching pattern that
is used at all nodes in Figure 31.6. Three alternative branching possibilities are shown in
Figure 31.6

node is rate; lower number is value of instrument.

down one’’. One alternative to this is ‘‘up two/up one/straight along’’, as shown in
Figure 31.7b. This proves useful for incorporating mean reversion when interest rates are
very low. A third branching pattern shown in Figure 31.7c is ‘‘straight along/down one/
down two’’. This is useful for incorporating mean reversion when interest rates are very
high. The use of diﬀerent branching patterns is illustrated in the following section.

A GENERAL TREE-BUILDING PROCEDURE
Hull and White have proposed a robust two-stage procedure for constructing trinomial
trees to represent a wide range of one-factor models.16 This section ﬁrst explains how
the procedure can be used for the Hull–White model in equation (31.13) and then
shows how it can be extended to represent other models, such as Black–Karasinski.
First Stage
The Hull–White model for the instantaneous short rate r is
dr ¼ ½ðtÞ  ar dt þ  dz
We suppose that the time step on the tree is constant and equal to t.17
Assume that the t rate, R, follows the same process as r.
dR ¼ ½ðtÞ  aR dt þ  dz
Clearly, this is reasonable in the limit as t tends to zero. The ﬁrst stage in building a
tree for this model is to construct a tree for a variable R that is initially zero and
follows the process
dR ¼ aR dt þ  dz

Factor Models,’’Journal of Derivatives, 2, 1 (1994): 7–16; and J. Hull and A. White, ‘‘Using Hull–White
Interest Rate Trees,’’ Journal of Derivatives, (Spring 1996): 26–36.

nonconstant time steps can be used.

This process is symmetrical about R ¼ 0. The variable Rðt þ tÞ  RðtÞ is normally
distributed. If terms of higher order than t are ignored, the expected value of
Rðt þ tÞ  RðtÞ is aRðtÞt and the variance of Rðt þ tÞ  RðtÞ is 2t.
The spacing between interest rates on the tree, R, is set as
R ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
3t
p
This proves to be a good choice of R from the viewpoint of error minimization.
The objective of the ﬁrst stage of the procedure is to build a tree similar to that shown
in Figure 31.8 for R. To do this, it is ﬁrst necessary to resolve which of the three
branching methods shown in Figure 31.7 will apply at each node. This will determine
the overall geometry of the tree. Once this is done, the branching probabilities must also
be calculated.
Deﬁne ði; jÞ as the node where t ¼ i t and R ¼ j R. (The variable i is a positive
integer and j is a positive or negative integer.) The branching method used at a node must
lead to the probabilities on all three branches being positive. Most of the time, the
branching shown in Figure 31.7a is appropriate. When a > 0, it is necessary to switch
from the branching in Figure 31.7a to the branching in Figure 31.7c for a suﬃciently large
j. Similarly, it is necessary to switch from the branching in Figure 31.7a to the branching
in Figure 31.7b when j is suﬃciently negative. Deﬁne jmax as the value of j where we
switch from the Figure 31.7a branching to the Figure 31.7c branching and jmin as the
value of j where we switch from the Figure 31.7a branching to the Figure 31.7b
branching. Hull and White show that probabilities are always positive if jmax is set equal

to the smallest integer greater than 0:184=ða tÞ and jmin is set equal to jmax.18 Deﬁne
pu, pm, and pd as the probabilities of the highest, middle, and lowest branches emanating
from the node. The probabilities are chosen to match the expected change and variance
of the change in R over the next time interval t. The probabilities must also sum to
unity. This leads to three equations in the three probabilities.
As already mentioned, the mean change in R in time t is aRt and the variance
of the change is 2t. At node ði; jÞ, R ¼ j R. If the branching has the form shown
in Figure 31.7a, the pu, pm, and pd at node ði; jÞ must satisfy the following three
equations to match the mean and standard deviation:
puR  pdR ¼ aj R t

¼ 0:0173, jmax is set equal to the smallest
integer greater than 0.184/0.1, and jmin ¼ jmax. This means that jmax ¼ 2 and
jmin ¼ 2 and the tree is as shown in Figure 31.8. The probabilities on the branches
emanating from each node are shown below the tree and are calculated using the
equations above for pu, pm, and pd.
Note that the probabilities at each node in Figure 31.8 depend only on j. For
example, the probabilities at node B are the same as the probabilities at node F.
Furthermore, the tree is symmetrical. The probabilities at node D are the mirror image
of the probabilities at node B.
18 The probabilities are positive for any value of jmax between 0:184=ða tÞ and 0:816=ða tÞ and for any
value of jmin between 0:184=ða tÞ and 0:816=ða tÞ. Changing the branching at the ﬁrst possible node
proves to be computationally most eﬃcient.

747

Second Stage
The second stage in the tree construction is to convert the tree for R into a tree for R.
This is accomplished by displacing the nodes on the R-tree so that the initial term
structure of interest rates is exactly matched. Deﬁne
	ðtÞ ¼ RðtÞ  RðtÞ
The 	ðtÞ’s that apply as the time step t on the tree becomes inﬁnitesimally small can be
calculated analytically from equation (31.14).19 However, we want a tree with a ﬁnite t
to match the term structure exactly. We therefore use an iterative procedure to
determine the 	’s.
Deﬁne 	i as 	ði tÞ, the value of R at time i t on the R-tree minus the corresponding
value of R at time i t on the R-tree. Deﬁne Qi;j as the present value of a security that
pays oﬀ$1 if node ði; jÞ is reached and zero otherwise. The 	i and Qi;j can be calculated
using forward induction in such a way that the initial term structure is matched exactly.
Illustration of Second Stage
Suppose that the continuously compounded zero rates in the example in Figure 31.8 are
as shown in Table 31.1. The value of Q0;0 is 1.0. The value of 	0 is chosen to give the
right price for a zero-coupon bond maturing at time t. That is, 	0 is set equal to the
initial t-period interest rate. Because t ¼ 1 in this example, 	0 ¼ 0:03824. This
deﬁnes the position of the initial node on the R-tree in Figure 31.9. The next step is
to calculate the values of Q1;1, Q1;0, and Q1;1. There is a probability of 0.1667 that the
ð1; 1Þ node is reached and the discount rate for the ﬁrst time step is 3.82%. The value of
Q1;1 is therefore 0:1667e0:0382 ¼ 0:1604. Similarly, Q1;0 ¼ 0:6417 and Q1;1 ¼ 0:1604.
Once Q1;1, Q1;0, and Q1;1 have been calculated, 	1 can be determined. It is chosen to
give the right price for a zero-coupon bond maturing at time 2t. Because R ¼ 0:01732
and t ¼ 1, the price of this bond as seen at node B is eð	1þ0:01732Þ. Similarly, the price as

19 To estimate the instantaneous 	ðtÞ analytically, we note that
dR ¼ ½ðtÞ  aR dt þ  dz
and
dR ¼ aR dt þ  dz
so that d	 ¼ ½ðtÞ  a	ðtÞ dt. Using equation (31.14), it can be seen that the solution to this is

Q1;1eð	1þ0:01732Þ þ Q1;0e	1 þ Q1;1eð	10:01732Þ
ð31:21Þ
From the initial term structure, this bond price should be e0:045122 ¼ 0:9137. Sub-
stituting for the Q’s in equation (31.21),
0:1604eð	1þ0:01732Þ þ 0:6417e	1 þ 0:1604eð	10:01732Þ ¼ 0:9137

¼ 0:05205
This means that the central node at time t in the tree for R corresponds to an interest
rate of 5.205% (see Figure 31.9).
The next step is to calculate Q2;2, Q2;1, Q2;0, Q2;1, and Q2;2. The calculations can
be shortened by using previously determined Q values. Consider Q2;1 as an example.
This is the value of a security that pays oﬀ$1 if node F is reached and zero otherwise.
Node F can be reached only from nodes B and C. The interest rates at these nodes are
6.937% and 5.205%, respectively. The probabilities associated with the B–F and C–F

branches are 0.6566 and 0.1667. The value at node B of a security that pays $1 at
node F is therefore 0:6566e0:06937. The value at node C is 0:1667e0:05205. The variable
Q2;1 is 0:6566e0:06937 times the present value of $1 received at node B plus
0:1667e0:05205 times the present value of $1 received at node C; that is,
Q2;1 ¼ 0:6566e0:06937  0:1604 þ 0:1667e0:05205  0:6417 ¼ 0:1998
Similarly, Q2;2 ¼ 0:0182, Q2;0 ¼ 0:4736, Q2;1 ¼ 0:2033, and Q2;2 ¼ 0:0189.
The next step in producing the R-tree in Figure 31.9 is to calculate 	2. After that, the
Q3;j’s can then be computed. The variable 	3 can then be calculated, and so on.
Formulas for 	’s and Q’s
To express the approach more formally, suppose that the Qi;j have been determined for
i 6 m (m > 0). The next step is to determine 	m so that the tree correctly prices a zero-
coupon bond maturing at ðm þ 1Þ t. The interest rate at node ðm; jÞ is 	m þ j R, so
that the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time ðm þ 1Þt is given by

solution to this equation is
	m ¼ ln Pnm
j¼nm Qm;jejRt  ln Pmþ1

where qðk; jÞ is the probability of moving from node ðm; kÞ to node ðm þ 1; jÞ and the

Extension to Other Models
The procedure that has just been outlined can be extended to more general models of
the form
dfðrÞ ¼ ½ðtÞ  afðrÞ dt þ  dz
ð31:23Þ
where f is a montonic function of r. This family of models has the property that they
can ﬁt any term structure.20
20 Not all no-arbitrage models have this property. For example, the extended-CIR model, considered by Cox,
Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) and Hull and White (1990), which has the form
dr ¼ ½ðtÞ  ar dt þ 
ﬃﬃr
p dz
cannot ﬁt yield curves where the forward rate declines sharply. This is because the process is not well deﬁned
when ðtÞ is negative.
750
CHAPTER 31

As before, we assume that the t period rate, R, follows the same process as r:
dfðRÞ ¼ ½ðtÞ  afðRÞ dt þ  dz
We start by setting x ¼ fðRÞ, so that
dx ¼ ½ðtÞ  ax dt þ  dz
The ﬁrst stage is to build a tree for a variable x that follows the same process as x
except that ðtÞ ¼ 0 and the initial value is zero. The procedure here is identical to the
procedure already outlined for building a tree such as that in Figure 31.8.
As in Figure 31.9, the nodes at time i t are then displaced by an amount 	i to provide
an exact ﬁt to the initial term structure. The equations for determining 	i and Qi;j
inductively are slightly diﬀerent from those for the fðRÞ ¼ R case. The value of Q at the
ﬁrst node, Q0;0, is set equal to 1. Suppose that the Qi;j have been determined for i 6 m
(m > 0). The next step is to determine 	m so that the tree correctly prices an ðm þ 1Þt
zero-coupon bond. Deﬁne g as the inverse function of f so that the t-period interest
rate at the jth node at time m t is

Figure 31.10 shows the results of applying the procedure to the Black–Karasinski
model in equation (31.18):
d lnðrÞ ¼ ½ðtÞ  a lnðrÞ dt þ  dz
when a ¼ 0:22,  ¼ 0:25, t ¼ 0:5, and the zero rates are as in Table 31.1.
Setting fðrÞ ¼ r leads to the Hull–White model in equation (31.13); setting
fðrÞ ¼ lnðrÞ leads to the Black–Karasinksi model in equation (31.18). The main
advantage of the fðrÞ ¼ r model is its analytic tractability. Its main disadvantage is
that negative interest rates are possible. In many circumstances, the probability of
negative interest rates occurring under the model is very small, but some analysts are
reluctant to use a model where there is any chance at all of negative interest rates. The
fðrÞ ¼ ln r model has no analytic tractability, but has the advantage that interest rates
are always positive.
Handling Low Interest Rate Environments
When interest rates are very low, it is not easy to choose a satisfactory model.
The
probability of negative interest rates in the Hull–White model is no longer negligible.
Also, the Black–Karasinski model does not work well because the same volatility is
not appropriate for both low and high rates. One idea to avoid negative rates is to
choose fðrÞ as proportional to ln r when r is low and proportional to r when it is
higher.21 Another idea is to choose the short rate as the absolute value of the rate given
by a Vasicek-type model. A better idea, suggested by Alexander Sokol, may be to
construct a model where both the reversion rate and the volatility of r are functions
of r. The variable r can then be transformed to a new variable x that has a constant dz
coeﬃcient and the tree-building approach with more general trinomial branching than
in Figure 31.7 can be used to implement the model.
Using Analytic Results in Conjunction with Trees
When a tree is constructed for the fðrÞ ¼ r version of the Hull–White model, the
analytic results in Section 31.3 can be used to provide the complete term structure
and European option prices at each node. It is important to recognize that the interest
rate on the tree is the t-period rate R. It is not the instantaneous short rate r.
From equations (31.15), (31.16), and (31.17) it can be shown (see Problem 31.20) that

Bond prices should therefore be calculated with equation (31.25), and not with
equation (31.15).
Example 31.1
Suppose zero rates are as in Table 31.2. The rates for maturities between those
indicated are generated using linear interpolation.
Consider a 3-year (¼ 3  365 days) European put option on a zero-coupon
bond that will pay 100 in 9 years (¼ 9  365 days). Interest rates are assumed
to follow the Hull–White (fðrÞ ¼ r) model. The strike price is 63, a ¼ 0:1, and
 ¼ 0:01. A 3-year tree is constructed and zero-coupon bond prices are calculated
analytically at the ﬁnal nodes as just described. As shown in Table 31.3, the results
from the tree are consistent with the analytic price of the option.
This example provides a good test of the implementation of the model because
the gradient of the zero curve changes sharply immediately after the expiration of
the option. Small errors in the construction and use of the tree are liable to have a
big eﬀect on the option values obtained. (The example is used in Sample Applica-
tion G of the DerivaGem Applications software.)

Tree for American Bond Options
The DerivaGem software accompanying this book implements the normal and
the lognormal model for valuing European and American bond options, caps/ﬂoors,
and European swap options. Figure 31.11 shows the tree produced by the software
when it is used to value a 1.5-year American call option on a 10-year bond using four
time steps and the lognormal (Black–Karasinski) model. The parameters used in the
lognormal model are a ¼ 5% and  ¼ 20%. The underlying bond lasts 10 years, has a
principal of 100, and pays a coupon of 5% per annum semiannually. The yield curve is
ﬂat at 5% per annum. The strike price is 105. As explained in Section 29.1 the strike
price can be a cash strike price or a quoted strike price. In this case it is a quoted strike
price. The bond price shown on the tree is the cash bond price. The accrued interest at
each node is shown below the tree. The cash strike price is calculated as the quoted
strike price plus accrued interest. The quoted bond price is the cash bond price minus
accrued interest. The payoﬀfrom the option is the cash bond price minus the cash strike
price. Equivalently it is the quoted bond price minus the quoted strike price.
The tree gives the price of the option as 0.672. A much larger tree with 100 time steps
gives the price of the option as 0.703. Note that the price of the 10-year bond cannot be
computed analytically when the lognormal model is assumed. It is computed numerically
by rolling back through a much larger tree than that shown.

CALIBRATION
Up to now, we have assumed that the volatility parameters a and  are known. We now
discuss how they are determined. This is known as calibrating the model.
The volatility parameters are determined from market data on actively traded options
(e.g., broker quotes on caps and swap options such as those in Tables 29.1 and 29.2).
These will be referred to as the calibrating instruments. The ﬁrst stage is to choose a
‘‘goodness-of-ﬁt’’ measure. Suppose there are n calibrating instruments. A popular
goodness-of-ﬁt measure is
X
n
i¼1
ðUi  ViÞ2
where Ui is the market price of the ith calibrating instrument and Vi is the price given by
Table 31.3
Value of a three-year put option on a
nine-year zero-coupon bond with a strike price of 63:
a ¼ 0:1 and  ¼ 0:01; zero curve as in Table 31.2.

the model for this instrument. The objective of calibration is to choose the model
parameters so that this goodness-of-ﬁt measure is minimized.
The number of volatility parameters should not be greater than the number of
calibrating instruments. If a and  are constant, there are only two volatility parameters.
The models can be extended so that a or , or both, are functions of time. Step functions
can be used. Suppose, for example, that a is constant and  is a function of time. We
might choose times t1, t2, . . . , tn and assume ðtÞ ¼ 0 for t 6 t1, ðtÞ ¼ i for
ti < t 6 tiþ1 (1 6 i 6 n  1), and ðtÞ ¼ n for t > tn. There would then be a total of
n þ 2 volatility parameters: a, 0, 1, . . . , and n.
The minimization of the goodness-of-ﬁt measure can be accomplished using the
Levenberg–Marquardt procedure.22 When a or , or both, are functions of time, a
penalty function is often added to the goodness-of-ﬁt measure so that the functions are

The second term provides a penalty for large changes in  between one step and the
next. The third term provides a penalty for high curvature in . Appropriate values for
w1;i and w2;i are based on experimentation and are chosen to provide a reasonable level
of smoothness in the  function.
The calibrating instruments chosen should be as similar as possible to the instrument
being valued. Suppose, for example, that the model is to be used to value a Bermudan-
style swap option that lasts 10 years and can be exercised on any payment date between
year 5 and year 9 into a swap maturing 10 years from today. The most relevant
calibrating instruments are 5  5, 6  4, 7  3, 8  2, and 9  1 European swap options.
(An n  m European swap option is an n-year option to enter into a swap lasting for
m years beyond the maturity of the option.)
The advantage of making a or , or both, functions of time is that the models can be
ﬁtted more precisely to the prices of instruments that trade actively in the market. The
disadvantage is that the volatility structure becomes nonstationary. The volatility term
structure given by the model in the future is liable to be quite diﬀerent from that existing
in the market today.23
A somewhat diﬀerent approach to calibration is to use all available calibrating
instruments to calculate ‘‘global-best-ﬁt’’ a and  parameters. The parameter a is held
ﬁxed at its best-ﬁt value. The model can then be used in the same way as Black–
Scholes–Merton. There is a one-to-one relationship between options prices and the 
parameter. The model can be used to convert tables such as Tables 29.1 and 29.2 into
tables of implied ’s.24 These tables can be used to assess the  most appropriate for
pricing the instrument under consideration.
31.9
HEDGING USING A ONE-FACTOR MODEL
Section 29.5 outlined some general approaches to hedging a portfolio of interest rate
derivatives. These approaches can be used with the term structure models in this
chapter. The calculation of deltas, gammas, and vegas involves making small changes
to either the zero curve or the volatility environment and recomputing the value of the
portfolio.
Note that, although one factor is often assumed when pricing interest rate derivatives,
it is not appropriate to assume only one factor when hedging. For example, the deltas
calculated should allow for many diﬀerent movements in the yield curve, not just those
that are possible under the model chosen. The practice of taking account of changes that
23 For a discussion of the implementation of a model where a and  are functions of time, see Technical
Note 16 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes.
24 Note that in a term structure model the implied ’s are not the same as the implied volatilities calculated
from Black’s model in Tables 29.1 and 29.2. The procedure for computing implied ’s is as follows. The Black
volatilities are converted to prices using Black’s model. An iterative procedure is then used to imply the 
parameter in the term structure model from the price.

CHAPTER 31

cannot happen under the model considered, as well as those that can, is known as
outside model hedging and is standard practice for traders.25 The reality is that relatively
simple one-factor models if used carefully usually give reasonable prices for instruments,
but good hedging procedures must explicitly or implicitly assume many factors.
SUMMARY
The traditional models of the term structure used in ﬁnance are known as equilibrium
models. These are useful for understanding potential relationships between variables in
the economy, but have the disadvantage that the initial term structure is an output from
the model rather than an input to it. When valuing derivatives, it is important that the
model used be consistent with the initial term structure observed in the market.
No-arbitrage models are designed to have this property. They take the initial term
structure as given and deﬁne how it can evolve.
This chapter has provided a description of a number of one-factor no-arbitrage
models of the short rate. These are robust and can be used in conjunction with any set
of initial zero rates. The simplest model is the Ho–Lee model. This has the advantage
that it is analytically tractable. Its chief disadvantage is that it implies that all rates are
equally variable at all times. The Hull–White model is a version of the Ho–Lee model
that includes mean reversion. It allows a richer description of the volatility environment
while preserving its analytic tractability. Lognormal one-factor models avoid the
possibility of negative interest rates, but have no analytic tractability.

HJM, LMM,
and Multiple
Zero Curves
The interest rate models discussed in Chapter 31 are widely used for pricing instruments
when the simpler models in Chapter 29 are inappropriate. They are easy to implement
and, if used carefully, can ensure that most nonstandard interest rate derivatives are
priced consistently with actively traded instruments such as interest rate caps, European
swap options, and European bond options. Two limitations of the models are:
1. Most involve only one factor (i.e., one source of uncertainty).
2. They do not give the user complete freedom in choosing the volatility structure.
By making the parameters a and  functions of time, an analyst can use the models so
that they ﬁt the volatilities observed in the market today, but as mentioned in Section 31.8
the volatility term structure is then nonstationary. The volatility structure in the future is
liable to be quite diﬀerent from that observed in the market today.
This chapter discusses some general approaches to building term structure models
that give the user more ﬂexibility in specifying the volatility environment and allow
several factors to be used. When OIS discounting is used, it is often necessary to develop
a model describing the evolution of two (or more) yield curves (e.g., the LIBOR zero
curve and the OIS zero curve). This chapter discusses how this can be done.
This chapter also covers the agency mortgage-backed security market in the United
States and describes how some of the ideas presented in the chapter can be used to price
instruments in that market.

Processes for Zero-Coupon Bond Prices and Forward Rates
We start by assuming there is just one factor and will use the traditional risk-neutral
world. A zero-coupon bond is a traded security providing no income. Its return in the
traditional risk-neutral world must therefore be r. This means that its stochastic process
has the form

general form of the model, any well-behaved function of past and present interest rates
and bond prices. Because a bond’s price volatility declines to zero at maturity, we must
have2
vðt; t; tÞ ¼ 0
From equation (4.5), the forward rate fðt; T1; T2Þ can be related to zero-coupon bond
prices as follows:

Equation (32.3) shows that the risk-neutral process for f depends solely on the v’s. It
depends on r and the P’s only to the extent that the v’s themselves depend on these
variables.
2 The vðt; t; tÞ ¼ 0 condition is equivalent to the assumption that all discount bonds have ﬁnite drifts at all
times. If the volatility of the bond does not decline to zero at maturity, an inﬁnite drift may be necessary to
ensure that the bond’s price equals its face value at maturity.

When we put T1 ¼ T and T2 ¼ T þ T in equation (32.3) and then take limits as T

Once the function vðt; T; tÞ has been speciﬁed, the risk-neutral processes for the
Fðt; TÞ’s are known.
Equation (32.4) shows that there is a link between the drift and standard deviation of
an instantaneous forward rate. This is the key HJM result. Integrating vðt; ; tÞ

This is the HJM result.
The process for the short rate r in the general HJM model is non-Markov. This means
that the process for r at a future time t depends on the path followed by r between now
and time t as well as on the the value of r at time t.3 This is the key problem in
implementing a general HJM model. Monte Carlo simulation has to be used. It is
diﬃcult to use a tree to represent term structure movements because the tree is usually
nonrecombining. Assuming the model has one factor and the tree is binomial as in
Figure 32.1, there are 2n nodes after n time steps (when n ¼ 30, 2n is about 1 billion).
The HJM model in equation (32.4) is deceptively complex. A particular forward rate
Fðt; TÞ is Markov in most applications of the model and can be represented by a
recombining tree. However, the same tree cannot be used for all forward rates. Setting
sðt; T; tÞ equal to a constant, , leads to the Ho–Lee model (see Problem 32.3); setting
sðt; T; tÞ ¼ eaðTtÞ leads to the Hull–White model (see Problem 32.4). These are
particular Markov cases of HJM where the same recombining tree can be used to
represent the short rate, r, and all forward rates.

THE LIBOR MARKET MODEL
One drawback of the HJM model is that it is expressed in terms of instantaneous
forward rates and these are not directly observable in the market. Another related
drawback is that it is diﬃcult to calibrate the model to prices of actively traded
instruments. This has led Brace, Gatarek, and Musiela (BGM), Jamshidian, and
Miltersen, Sandmann, and Sondermann to propose an alternative.4 It is known as
the LIBOR market model (LMM) or the BGM model and it is expressed in terms of the
forward rates that traders use in conjunction with LIBOR discounting.

The Model
Deﬁne t0 ¼ 0 and let t1, t2, . . . be the reset times for caps that trade in the market today. In
the United States, the most popular caps have quarterly resets, so that it is approximately
true that t1 ¼ 0:25, t2 ¼ 0:5, t3 ¼ 0:75, and so on. Deﬁne k ¼ tkþ1  tk, and
FkðtÞ: Forward rate between times tk and tkþ1 as seen at time t, expressed with a
compounding period of k and an actual/actual day count
mðtÞ: Index for the next reset date at time t; this means that mðtÞ is the smallest
integer such that t 6 tmðtÞ
kðtÞ: Volatility of FkðtÞ at time t.
Initially, we will assume that there is only one factor.
As shown in Section 28.4, in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to
Pðt; tkþ1Þ, FkðtÞ is a martingale and follows the process
dFkðtÞ ¼ kðtÞFkðtÞ dz
ð32:7Þ
where dz is a Wiener process.
The process for Pðt; tkÞ has the form
dPðt; tkÞ
Pðt; tkÞ ¼    þ vkðtÞ dz
where vkðtÞ is negative because bond prices and interest rates are negatively related.
In practice, it is often most convenient to value interest rate derivatives by working
in a world that is always forward risk neutral with respect to a bond maturing at the
next reset date. We refer to this as a rolling forward risk-neutral world.5 In this world
we can discount from time tkþ1 to time tk using the zero rate observed at time tk for a
maturity tkþ1. We do not have to worry about what happens to interest rates between
times tk and tkþ1.
At time t the rolling forward risk-neutral world is a world that is forward risk neutral
with respect to the bond price, Pðt; tmðtÞÞ. Equation (32.7) gives the process followed by
FkðtÞ in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to Pðt; tkþ1Þ. From Section 28.8,
it follows that the process followed by FkðtÞ in the rolling forward risk-neutral world is
dFkðtÞ ¼ kðtÞ½vmðtÞðtÞ  vkþ1ðtÞFkðtÞ dt þ kðtÞFkðtÞ dz

Itoˆ ’s lemma can be used to calculate the process followed by both the left-hand side and
5 In the terminology of Section 28.4, this world corresponds to using a ‘‘rolling CD’’ as the numeraire. A
rolling CD (certiﬁcate of deposit) is one where we start with $1, buy a bond maturing at time t1, reinvest the
proceeds at time t1 in a bond maturing at time t2, reinvest the proceeds at time t2 in a bond maturing at time
t3, and so on. (Strictly speaking, the interest rate trees we constructed in Chapter 31 are in a rolling forward
risk-neutral world rather than the traditional risk-neutral world.) The numeraire is a CD rolled over at the
end of each time step.

The HJM result in equation (32.4) is the limiting case of this as the i tend to zero (see
Problem 32.7).
Forward Rate Volatilities
The model can be simpliﬁed by assuming that kðtÞ is a function only of the number of
whole accrual periods between the next reset date and time tk. Deﬁne i as the value
of kðtÞ when there are i such accrual periods. This means that kðtÞ ¼ kmðtÞ is a step
function.
The i can (at least in theory) be estimated from the volatilities used to value caplets in
Black’s model (i.e., from the spot volatilities in Figure 29.3).7 Suppose that k is the Black
volatility for the caplet that corresponds to the period between times tk and tkþ1.
Equating variances, we must have

This equation can be used to obtain the ’s iteratively.
Example 32.1
Assume that the i are all equal and the Black caplet spot volatilities for the ﬁrst
three caplets are 24%, 22%, and 20%. This means that 0 ¼ 24%. Since

1 is 19.80%. Also, since
2

2 is 15.23%.
Example 32.2
Consider the data in Table 32.1 on caplet volatilities k. These exhibit the hump
discussed in Section 29.2. The ’s are shown in the second row. Notice that the
hump in the ’s is more pronounced than the hump in the ’s.
6 Since the v’s and ’s have opposite signs, the bond price volatility becomes larger (in absolute terms) as the
time to maturity increases. This is as expected.
7 In practice the ’s are determined using a least-squares calibration, as we will discuss later.

forward rates at time t2 from those at time t1; and so on.
Extension to Several Factors
The LIBOR market model can be extended to incorporate several independent factors.
Suppose that there are p factors and k;q is the component of the volatility of FkðtÞ
attributable to the qth factor. Equation (32.10) becomes (see Problem 32.11)

where the q are random samples from a normal distribution with mean equal to zero

The approximation that the drift of a forward rate remains constant within each
accrual period allows us to jump from one reset date to the next in the simulation. This
is convenient because as already mentioned the rolling forward risk-neutral world
allows us to discount from one reset date to the next. Suppose that we wish to simulate
a zero curve for N accrual periods. On each trial we start with the forward rates at time
zero. These are F0ð0Þ, F1ð0Þ, . . . , FN1ð0Þ and are calculated from the initial zero curve.
Equation (32.16) is used to calculate F1ðt1Þ, F2ðt1Þ, . . . , FN1ðt1Þ. Equation (32.16) is
then used again to calculate F2ðt2Þ, F3ðt2Þ, . . . , FN1ðt2Þ, and so on, until FN1ðtN1Þ is
obtained. Note that as we move through time the zero curve gets shorter and shorter.
For example, suppose each accrual period is 3 months and N ¼ 40. We start with a
10-year zero curve. At the 6-year point (at time t24), the simulation gives us information
on a 4-year zero curve.
The drift approximation that we have used (i.e., FiðtÞ ¼ FiðtjÞ for tj < t < tjþ1) can
be tested by valuing caplets using equation (32.16) and comparing the prices to those
given by Black’s model. The value of FkðtkÞ is the realized rate for the time period
between tk and tkþ1 and enables the caplet payoﬀat time tkþ1 to be calculated. This
payoﬀis discounted back to time zero, one accrual period at a time. The caplet value is
the average of the discounted payoﬀs. The results of this type of analysis show that the
cap values from Monte Carlo simulation are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those given
by Black’s model. This is true even when the accrual periods are 1 year in length and a
very large number of trials is used.8 This suggests that the drift approximation is
innocuous in most situations.
Ratchet Caps, Sticky Caps, and Flexi Caps
The LIBOR market model can be used to value some types of nonstandard caps.
Consider ratchet caps and sticky caps. These incorporate rules for determining how the
cap rate for each caplet is set. In a ratchet cap it equals the LIBOR rate at the previous
reset date plus a spread. In a sticky cap it equals the previous capped rate plus a spread.
Suppose that the cap rate at time tj is Kj, the LIBOR rate at time tj is Rj, and the
spread is s. In a ratchet cap, Kjþ1 ¼ Rj þ s. In a sticky cap, Kjþ1 ¼ minðRj; KjÞ þ s.
Tables 32.2 and 32.3 provide valuations of a ratchet cap and sticky cap using the
LIBOR market model with one, two, and three factors, and LIBOR discounting. The
principal is $100. The term structure is assumed to be ﬂat at 5% per annum con-
tinuously compounded, or 5.127% annually compounded, and the caplet volatilities are
8 See J. C. Hull and A. White, ‘‘Forward Rate Volatilities, Swap Rate Volatilities, and the Implementation of
the LIBOR Market Model,’’ Journal of Fixed Income, 10, 2 (September 2000): 46–62. The only exception is
when the cap volatilities are very high.
HJM, LMM, and Multiple Zero Curves
769

as in Table 32.1. The interest rate is reset annually. The spread is 25 basis points applied
to the annually compounded rate. Tables 32.4 and 32.5 show how the volatility was
split into components when two- and three-factor models were used. The results are
based on 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations incorporating the antithetic variable
technique described in Section 21.7. The standard error of each price is about 0.001.
A third type of nonstandard cap is a ﬂexi cap. This is like a regular cap except that
there is a limit on the total number of caplets that can be exercised. Consider an annual-
pay ﬂexi cap when the principal is $100, the term structure is ﬂat at 5%, and the cap
volatilities are as in Tables 32.1, 32.4, and 32.5. Suppose that all in-the-money caplets
are exercised up to a maximum of ﬁve. With one, two, and three factors, the LIBOR
market model gives the price of the instrument as 3.43, 3.58, and 3.61, respectively (see
Problem 32.15 for other types of ﬂexi caps).

CHAPTER 32

The pricing of a plain vanilla cap depends only on the total volatility and is
independent of the number of factors. This is because the price of a plain vanilla caplet
depends on the behavior of only one forward rate. The prices of caplets in the
nonstandard instruments we have looked at are diﬀerent in that they depend on the
joint probability distribution of several diﬀerent forward rates. As a result they do
depend on the number of factors.
Valuing European Swap Options

In the situation where the length of the accrual period for the swap underlying the

The accrual periods for the swaps underlying broker quotes for European swap
options do not always match the accrual periods for the caps and ﬂoors underlying
broker quotes. For example, in the United States, the benchmark caps and ﬂoors have
quarterly resets, while the swaps underlying the benchmark European swap options
have semiannual resets. Fortunately, the valuation result for European swap options
can be extended to the situation where each swap accrual period includes M subperiods
that could be accrual periods in a typical cap. Deﬁne j;m as the length of the mth

Here j;m;qðtÞ is the qth component of the volatility of Gj;mðtÞ. It is the qth component
of the volatility of a cap forward rate when the time to maturity is from t to the
beginning of the mth subperiod in the ðTj; Tjþ1Þ swap accrual period.
The expressions (32.18) and (32.19) for the swap volatility do involve the approxima-
tions that GjðtÞ ¼ Gjð0Þ and Gj;mðtÞ ¼ Gj;mð0Þ. Hull and White compared the prices of
European swap options calculated using equations (32.18) and (32.19) with the prices
calculated from a Monte Carlo simulation and found the two to be very close. Once the
LIBOR market model has been calibrated, equations (32.18) and (32.19) therefore
provide a quick way of valuing European swap options. Analysts can determine
whether European swap options are overpriced or underpriced relative to caps. As
we shall see shortly, they can also use the results to calibrate the model to the market
prices of swap options. The analysis can be extended to cover OIS discounting.
Calibrating the Model
The variable j is the volatility at time t of the forward rate Fj for the period between tk
and tkþ1 when there are j whole accrual periods between t and tk. To calibrate the
LIBOR market model, it is necessary to determine the j and how they are split into
j;q. The ’s are usually determined from current market data, whereas the split into ’s
is determined from historical data.
Consider ﬁrst the determination of the ’s from the ’s. A principal components
analysis (see Section 22.9) on forward rate data can be used. The model is
Fj ¼

where M is the total number of factors (which equals the number of diﬀerent forward
rates), Fj is the change in the jth forward rate Fj, 
j;q is the factor loading for the jth
forward rate and the qth factor, xq is the factor score for the qth factor. Deﬁne sq as the
standard deviation of the qth factor score. If the number of factors used in the LIBOR
market model, p, is equal to the total number of factors, M, it is correct to set
j;q ¼

Consider next the estimation of the ’s. Equation (32.11) provides one way that they
can be theoretically determined so that they are consistent with caplet prices. In
practice, this is not usually used because it often leads to wild swings in the ’s and
sometimes there is no set of ’s exactly consistent with cap quotes. A commonly used
calibration procedure is similar to that described in Section 31.8. Suppose that Ui is the
market price of the ith calibrating instrument (typically a cap or European swaption)
and Vi is the model price. The ’s are chosen to minimize

where P is a penalty function chosen to ensure that the ’s are ‘‘well behaved.’’

When the calibrating instrument is a European swaption, formulas (32.18) and (32.19)
make the minimization feasible using the Levenberg–Marquardt procedure. Equa-
tion (32.20) is used to determine the ’s from the ’s.
Volatility Skews
Brokers provide quotes on caps that are not at the money as well as on caps that are at
the money. In some markets a volatility skew is observed, that is, the quoted (Black)
volatility for a cap or a ﬂoor is a declining function of the strike price. This can be
handled using the CEV model. (See Section 27.1 for the application of the CEV model
to equities.) The model is

similarly to the lognormal model. Caps and ﬂoors can be valued analytically using the
cumulative noncentral 2 distribution. There are similar analytic approximations to
those given above for the prices of European swap options.10
Bermudan Swap Options
A popular interest rate derivative is a Bermudan swap option. This is a swap option
that can be exercised on some or all of the payment dates of the underlying swap.
Bermudan swap options are diﬃcult to value using the LIBOR market model because
the LIBOR market model relies on Monte Carlo simulation and it is diﬃcult to
evaluate early exercise decisions when Monte Carlo simulation is used. Fortunately,
the procedures described in Section 27.8 can be used. Longstaﬀand Schwartz apply the
least-squares approach when there are a large number of factors. The value of not
exercising on a particular payment date is assumed to be a polynomial function of the

values of the factors.11 Andersen shows that the optimal early exercise boundary
approach can be used. He experiments with a number of ways of parameterizing the
early exercise boundary and ﬁnds that good results are obtained when the early exercise
decision is assumed to depend only on the intrinsic value of the option.12. Most traders
value Bermudan options using one of the one-factor no-arbitrage models discussed in
Chapter 31. However, the accuracy of one-factor models for pricing Bermudan swap
options has been a controversial issue.13
32.3
HANDLING MULTIPLE ZERO CURVES
The models in Chapters 29 to 31 and those considered so far in this chapter assume that
only one yield curve is required to value an interest rate derivative. Prior to the credit
crisis that started in 2007, this was often the case. For many derivatives, both the payoﬀs
and the discount factors were calculated from the LIBOR/swap zero curve. As explained
in Chapter 9, it is now usual to use the OIS zero curve as the risk-free zero curve for
discounting—at least when collateralized transactions are being valued. This means that
more than one zero curve must be modeled for derivatives such as swaps, interest rate
caps, and swaptions whose payoﬀs depend on LIBOR. A LIBOR zero curve is necessary
to calculate the payoﬀs; the OIS zero curve is necessary for discounting.
If we model both the OIS zero curve and the LIBOR/swap zero curve, and assume
that banks can risklessly borrow or lend at the rates given by either curve, it is not
possible to assume, as we have done up to now, that there is no arbitrage in ﬁnancial
markets. Banks can borrow at the OIS rate and lend at LIBOR to lock in a proﬁt. The
alternative is to model credit risk and liquidity risk so that the spread between LIBOR
and OIS is explained. Unfortunately, this adds a huge layer of complexity and makes
models very diﬃcult to use. Practitioners have therefore decided to model LIBOR and
OIS separately, without explicitly considering default risk and liquidity risk, and
ignoring the arbitrage opportunities created by the use of more than one zero curve.
It might be thought that there is a single LIBOR curve. If we knew what the process
for the instantaneous LIBOR short rate was, we would, as explained in Chapter 31,
know the complete LIBOR zero curve. Prior to the credit crisis, this was a reasonable
assumption. Since the crisis, as mentioned in Section 9.3, practitioners calculate
separate zero curves from instruments dependent on 1-month, 3-month, 6-month,
and 12-month LIBOR rates. These zero curves are not the same.14 This means that
in practice at least ﬁve diﬀerent zero curves are used by derivatives desks for LIBOR-
based products.

Squares Approach,’’ Review of Financial Studies, 14, 1 (2001): 113–47.

14 For a discussion of this and illustration of the diﬀerences, see, for example, M. Bianchetti, ‘‘Two Curves,
One Price,’’ Risk, 23, 8 (August 2010): 66–72. The use of multiple LIBOR zero curves reﬂects credit risk. A
12-month LIBOR loan has more risk than 12 continually refreshed 1-month LIBOR loans.
HJM, LMM, and Multiple Zero Curves
775

Modeling the OIS zero curve is in principle straightforward. Either the model-of-
short-rate approach in Chapter 31 or the HJM/LMM framework discussed in this
chapter can be used. (The ‘‘LIBOR market model’’ then becomes the ‘‘OIS market
model.’’) In Section 9.3, we explained that forward LIBOR rates calculated when OIS
discounting is used are not the same as forward LIBOR rates when LIBOR discounting
is used. This is an important point, sometimes overlooked by practitioners. Deﬁne
FLDðt; t1; t2Þ as the forward LIBOR at time t for the period between t1 and t2 when
LIBOR discounting is used and FODðt; t1; t2Þ as the same when OIS discounting is used.
Examples 9.2 and 9.3 indicate how the FLDðt; t1; t2Þ and FODðt; t1; t2Þ can be boot-
strapped from LIBOR-for-ﬁxed swap quotes.15 Deﬁne PLDðt; TÞ as the price at time t of
a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T when LIBOR discounting is used and PODðt; TÞ
as the same when OIS discounting is used. From Section 28.4, FLDðt; t1; t2Þ is a
martingale in a world that is forward risk-neutral with respect to PLDðt; t2Þ, so that it
equals the expected LIBOR rate between t1 and t2 in this world. We have used this
result to value caplets under LIBOR discounting (see Section 29.2). However,
FLDðt; t1; t2Þ is not in general a martingale in a world that is forward risk-neutral with
respect to PODðt; t2Þ. When using OIS discounting it is necessary to work with
FODðt; t1; t2Þ, not FLDðt; t1; t2Þ. This is because FODðt; t1; t2Þ is a martingale in a world
that is forward risk-neutral with respect to PODðt; t2Þ, so that it equals the expected
LIBOR rate between t1 and t2 in this world.
As explained in Chapter 9, to value a swap under OIS discounting we assume that
the forward rates, FODðt; t1; t2Þ, are realized and discount at OIS rates. To value
caplets and ﬂoorlets, we can use equations (29.7) and (29.8), but, as explained in
Section 29.4, we have to be careful to deﬁne variables appropriately. The variable Fk
in these equations is FODð0; tk; tkþ1Þ and the variable Pð0; tkþ1Þ in the equations is
PODð0; tkþ1Þ. The volatility k, which is usually implied from market prices, may
depend on whether LIBOR or OIS discounting is used.
Similar arguments can be used to value swaptions under OIS discounting. Equa-
tions (29.10) and (29.11) can be used provided that we set
A ¼ 1
m
X
mn
i¼1
PODð0; TiÞ
and calculate the forward swap rate from the FOD’s rather than the FLD’s. Again
implied volatilities may depend on whether LIBOR or OIS discounting is used.
DerivaGem 3.00 values swaps, caps/ﬂoors, and swaptions with either LIBOR or OIS
discounting.
To value more complex products, it is often necessary to model the LIBOR and OIS
zero curves simultaneously. A number of researchers have suggested ways this can be
done. One approach is to model the evolution of the two curves separately, e.g., by
assuming that LIBOR and OIS short rates follow correlated stochastic processes. This
has the disadvantage that OIS rates can exceed the corresponding LIBOR rates. A better
idea is to use either the model-of-short-rate approach in Chapter 31 or the HJM/LMM
framework discussed in this chapter to model OIS rates. The term structure of the spread
of LIBOR over OIS can then be modeled separately as a nonnegative variable. The
15 As already explained, several LIBOR zero curves are now used in practice. In what follows, we assume
that the LIBOR curve used corresponds to the tenor of the LIBOR rate being considered.
776
CHAPTER 32

simplest approach is to assume that the spread equals the forward spread. For a
stochastic spread model, we know that the forward LIBOR, FODðt; ti; tiþ1Þ, is a martin-
gale in a world that is forward risk-neutral with respect to PODðt; tiþ1Þ. The forward OIS
between ti and tiþ1 is also a martingale in this world. The spread (i.e., diﬀerence between
the two) is therefore a martingale in the world.
The model for forward spreads can be based on one or more factors similarly to the
models in equations (32.10) and (32.15) for forward interest rates, so that16

where, for the purposes of this equation, we deﬁne FkðtÞ as the forward spread between
times tk and tkþ1 as seen at time t and k;q as the qth component of the volatility of this
forward spread. All the results given in Section 32.2 for calculating the process followed
by interest rates under the rolling forward risk-neutral measure then apply to spreads.
32.4
AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
One application of the models presented in this chapter is to the agency mortgage-
backed security (agency MBS) market in the United States.
An agency MBS is similar to the ABS considered in Chapter 8 except that payments
are guaranteed by a government-related agency such as the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) or the Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA) so that investors are protected against defaults. This makes an agency MBS
sound like a regular ﬁxed-income security issued by the government. In fact, there is a
critical diﬀerence between an agency MBS and a regular ﬁxed-income investment. This
diﬀerence is that the mortgages in an agency MBS pool have prepayment privileges.
These prepayment privileges can be quite valuable to the householder. In the United
States, mortgages typically last for 30 years and can be prepaid at any time. This means
that the householder has a 30-year American-style option to put the mortgage back to
the lender at its face value.
Prepayments on mortgages occur for a variety of reasons. Sometimes interest rates fall
and the owner of the house decides to reﬁnance at a lower rate. On other occasions, a
mortgage is prepaid simply because the house is being sold. A critical element in valuing
an agency MBS is the determination of what is known as the prepayment function. This is
a function describing expected prepayments on the underlying pool of mortgages at a
time t in terms of the yield curve at time t and other relevant variables.
A prepayment function is very unreliable as a predictor of actual prepayment
experience for an individual mortgage. When many similar mortgage loans are com-
bined in the same pool, there is a ‘‘law of large numbers’’ eﬀect at work and
prepayments can be predicted more accurately from an analysis of historical data. As
mentioned, prepayments are not always motivated by pure interest rate considerations.
Nevertheless, there is a tendency for prepayments to be more likely when interest rates
are low than when they are high. This means that investors require a higher rate of
interest on an agency MBS than on other ﬁxed-income securities to compensate for the
prepayment options they have written.

HJM, LMM, and Multiple Zero Curves
777

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
The simplest type of agency MBS is referred to as a pass-through. All investors receive
the same return and bear the same prepayment risk. Not all mortgage-backed
securities work in this way. In a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) the investors
are divided into a number of classes and rules are developed for determining how
principal repayments are channeled to diﬀerent classes. A CMO creates classes of
securities that bear diﬀerent amounts of prepayment risk in the same way that the
ABS considered in Chapter 8 creates classes of securities bearing diﬀerent amounts of
credit risk.
As an example of a CMO, consider an agency MBS where investors are divided into
three classes: class A, class B, and class C. All the principal repayments (both those that
are scheduled and those that are prepayments) are channeled to class A investors until
investors in this class have been completely paid oﬀ. Principal repayments are then
channeled to class B investors until these investors have been completely paid oﬀ.
Finally, principal repayments are channeled to class C investors. In this situation,
class A investors bear the most prepayment risk. The class A securities can be expected
to last for a shorter time than the class B securities, and these, in turn, can be expected
to last less long than the class C securities.
The objective of this type of structure is to create classes of securities that are more
attractive to institutional investors than those created by a simpler pass-through MBS.
The prepayment risks assumed by the diﬀerent classes depend on the par value in each
class. For example, class C bears very little prepayment risk if the par values in classes
A, B, and C are 400, 300, and 100, respectively. Class C bears rather more prepayment
risk in the situation where the par values in the classes are 100, 200, and 500.
The creators of mortgage-backed securities have created many more exotic structures
than the one we have just described. Business Snapshot 32.1 gives an example.
Valuing Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
Agency MBSs are usually valued by modeling the behavior of Treasury rates using
Monte Carlo simulation. The HJM/LMM approach can be used. Consider what
happens on one simulation trial. Each month, expected prepayments are calculated
from the current yield curve and the history of yield curve movements. These prepay-
ments determine the expected cash ﬂows to the holder of the agency MBS and the cash
ﬂows are discounted at the Treasury rate plus a spread to time zero to obtain a sample
value for the agency MBS. An estimate of the value of the agency MBS is the average of
the sample values over many simulation trials.
Option-Adjusted Spread
In addition to calculating theoretical prices for mortgage-backed securities and other
bonds with embedded options, traders also like to compute what is known as the
option-adjusted spread (OAS). This is a measure of the spread over the yields on
government Treasury bonds provided by the instrument when all options have been
taken into account.
To calculate an OAS for an instrument, it is priced as described above using Treasury
rates plus a spread for discounting. The price of the instrument given by the model is
778
CHAPTER 32

compared to the price in the market. A series of iterations is then used to determine the
value of the spread that causes the model price to be equal to the market price. This
spread is the OAS.
SUMMARY
The HJM and LMM models provide approaches to valuing interest rate derivatives that
give the user complete freedom in choosing the volatility term structure. The LMM
model has two key advantages over the HJM model. First, it is developed in terms of the
forward rates that determine the pricing of caps, rather than in terms of instantaneous
forward rates. Second, it is relatively easy to calibrate to the price of caps or European
swap options. The HJM and LMM models both have the disadvantage that they cannot
be represented as recombining trees. In practice, this means that they must usually be
implemented using Monte Carlo simulation and require much more computation time
than the models in Chapter 31.
Since the credit crisis that started in 2007, the OIS rate has been used as the risk-free
discount rate for collateralized derivatives. This means that the valuation procedures
for interest rates swaps, caps/ﬂoors, and swaptions must be adjusted so that OIS rates
are used as discount rates and forward interest rates and swap rates are calculated
using the appropriate forward risk-neutral measures. For more complicated instru-
ments, it is necessary to model the joint evolution of the OIS zero curve and the
LIBOR zero curve.
The agency mortgage-backed security market in the United States has given birth to
many exotic interest rate derivatives: CMOs, IOs, POs, and so on. These instruments
provide cash ﬂows to the holder that depend on the prepayments on a pool of
mortgages. These prepayments depend on, among other things, the level of interest
rates. Because they are heavily path dependent, agency mortgage-backed securities
usually have to be valued using Monte Carlo simulation. These are, therefore, ideal
candidates for applications of the HJM and LMM models.
Business Snapshot 32.1
IOs and POs
In what is known as a stripped MBS, principal payments are separated from interest
payments. All principal payments are channeled to one class of security, known as a
principal only (PO). All interest payments are channeled to another class of security
known as an interest only (IO). Both IOs and POs are risky investments. As
prepayment rates increase, a PO becomes more valuable and an IO becomes less
valuable. As prepayment rates decrease, the reverse happens. In a PO, a ﬁxed amount
of principal is returned to the investor, but the timing is uncertain. A high rate of
prepayments on the underlying pool leads to the principal being received early (which
is, of course, good news for the holder of the PO). A low rate of prepayments on the
underlying pool delays the return of the principal and reduces the yield provided by
the PO. In the case of an IO, the total of the cash ﬂows received by the investor is
uncertain. The higher the rate of prepayments, the lower the total cash ﬂows received
by the investor, and vice versa.

32.15. In the ﬂexi cap considered in Section 32.2 the holder is obligated to exercise the ﬁrst
N in-the-money caplets. After that no further caplets can be exercised. (In the example,
N ¼ 5.) Two other ways that ﬂexi caps are sometimes deﬁned are:
(a) The holder can choose whether any caplet is exercised, but there is a limit of N on
the total number of caplets that can be exercised.
(b) Once the holder chooses to exercise a caplet all subsequent in-the-money caplets
must be exercised up to a maximum of N.
Discuss the problems in valuing these types of ﬂexi caps. Of the three types of ﬂexi
caps, which would you expect to be most expensive? Which would you expect to be
least expensive?

Swaps Revisited
Swaps have been central to the success of over-the-counter derivatives markets. They
have proved to be very ﬂexible instruments for managing risk. Based on the range of
diﬀerent contracts that now trade and the total volume of business transacted each year,
swaps are arguably one of the most successful innovations in ﬁnancial markets ever.
Chapters 7 and 9 discussed how plain vanilla LIBOR-for-ﬁxed interest rate swaps can
be valued. The standard approach can be summarized as: ‘‘Assume forward rates will
be realized.’’ The steps are as follows:
1. Calculate the swap’s net cash ﬂows on the assumption that LIBOR rates in the
future equal the forward rates calculated from instruments trading in the market
today. (As explained in Section 9.3, the forward rates when OIS discounting is
used are diﬀerent from those when LIBOR discounting is used.)
2. Set the value of the swap equal to the present value of the net cash ﬂows.
This chapter describes a number of nonstandard swaps. Some can be valued using the
‘‘assume forward rates will be realized’’ approach; some require the application of the
convexity, timing, and quanto adjustments we encountered in Chapter 30; some
contain embedded options that must be valued using the procedures described in
Chapters 29, 31, and 32.
33.1
VARIATIONS ON THE VANILLA DEAL
Many interest rate swaps involve relatively minor variations to the plain vanilla
structure discussed in Chapter 7. In some swaps the notional principal changes with
time in a predetermined way. Swaps where the notional principal is an increasing
function of time are known as step-up swaps. Swaps where the notional principal is a
decreasing function of time are known as amortizing swaps. Step-up swaps could be
useful for a construction company that intends to borrow increasing amounts of
money at ﬂoating rates to ﬁnance a particular project and wants to swap to ﬁxed-rate
funding. An amortizing swap could be used by a company that has ﬁxed-rate
borrowings with a certain prepayment schedule and wants to swap to borrowings at
a ﬂoating rate.
782

C H A P T E R

The principal can be diﬀerent on the two sides of a swap. Also the frequency of
payments can be diﬀerent. Business Snapshot 33.1 illustrates this by showing a hypo-
thetical swap between Microsoft and Goldman Sachs where the notional principal is
$120 million on the ﬂoating side and $100 million on ﬁxed side. Payments are made
every month on the ﬂoating side and every 6 months on the ﬁxed side. These type of
variations to the basic plain vanilla structure do not aﬀect the valuation methodology.
The ‘‘assume forward rates are realized’’ approach can still be used.
The ﬂoating reference rate for a swap is not always LIBOR. For instance, in some
swaps it is the commercial paper (CP) rate or the OIS rate. A basis swap involves
exchanging cash ﬂows calculated using one ﬂoating reference rate for cash ﬂows
calculated using another ﬂoating reference rate. An example would be a swap where
the 3-month OIS rate plus 10 basis points is exchanged for 3-month LIBOR with both
being applied to a principal of $100 million. A basis swap could be used for risk
management by a ﬁnancial institution whose assets and liabilities are dependent on
diﬀerent ﬂoating reference rates.
Swaps where the ﬂoating reference rate is not LIBOR can usually be valued using the
‘‘assume forward rates are realized’’ approach. The forward rate is calculated so that
swaps involving the reference rate have zero value. (This is similar to the way forward
LIBOR is calculated when OIS discounting is used.)

33.2
COMPOUNDING SWAPS
Another variation on the plain vanilla swap is a compounding swap. A hypothetical
conﬁrmation for a compounding swap is in Business Snapshot 33.2. In this example
there is only one payment date for both the ﬂoating-rate payments and the ﬁxed-rate
payments. This is at the end of the life of the swap. The ﬂoating rate of interest is
LIBOR plus 20 basis points. Instead of being paid, the interest is compounded forward
until the end of the life of the swap at a rate of LIBOR plus 10 basis points. The ﬁxed
rate of interest is 6%. Instead of being paid this interest is compounded forward at a
ﬁxed rate of interest of 6.3% until the end of the swap.
The ‘‘assume forward rates are realized’’ approach can be used at least approximately
for valuing a compounding swap such as that in Business Snapshot 33.2. It is straight-
forward to deal with the ﬁxed side of the swap because the payment that will be made at
maturity is known with certainty. The ‘‘assume forward rates are realized’’ approach for
the ﬂoating side is justiﬁable because there exist a series of forward rate agreements

CHAPTER 33

(FRAs) where the ﬂoating-rate cash ﬂows are exchanged for the values they would have
if each ﬂoating rate equaled the corresponding forward rate.1
Example 33.1
A compounding swap with annual resets has a life of 3 years. A ﬁxed rate is paid
and a ﬂoating rate is received. The ﬁxed interest rate is 4% and the ﬂoating interest
rate is 12-month LIBOR. The ﬁxed side compounds at 3.9% and the ﬂoating side
compounds at 12-month LIBOR minus 20 basis points. The LIBOR/swap zero
curve is used for discounting. It is ﬂat at 5% with annual compounding and the
notional principal is $100 million.
On the ﬁxed side, interest of $4 million is earned at the end of the ﬁrst year.
This compounds to 4  1:039 ¼ $4:156 million at the end of the second year.
A second interest amount of $4 million is added at the end of the second year
bringing the total compounded forward amount to $8.156 million. This com-
pounds to 8:156  1:039 ¼ $8:474 million by the end of the third year when there
is the third interest amount of $4 million. The cash ﬂow at the end of the third
year on the ﬁxed side of the swap is therefore $12.474 million.
On the ﬂoating side we assume all future interest rates equal the corresponding
forward LIBOR rates. Because we are assuming LIBOR discounting, this means
that all future interest rates are assumed to be 5% with annual compounding. The
interest calculated at the end of the ﬁrst year is $5 million. Compounding this
forward at 4.8% (forward LIBOR minus 20 basis points) gives 5  1:048 ¼
$5:24 million at the end of the second year. Adding in the interest, the compounded
forward amount is $10.24 million. Compounding forward to the end of the third
year, we get 10:24  1:048 ¼ $10:731 million. Adding in the ﬁnal interest gives
$15.731 million.
The swap can be valued by assuming that it leads to an inﬂow of $15.731 million
and an outﬂow of $12.474 million at the end of year 3. The value of the swap is
therefore
15:731  12:474
1:053
¼ 2:814
or $2.814 million. (This analysis ignores day count issues and makes the approx-
imation indicated in footnote 1.)
33.3
CURRENCY SWAPS
Currency swaps were introduced in Chapter 7. They enable an interest rate exposure in
one currency to be swapped for an interest rate exposure in another currency. Usually
two principals are speciﬁed, one in each currency. The principals are exchanged at both
the beginning and the end of the life of the swap as described in Section 7.9.
Suppose that the currencies involved in a currency swap are US dollars (USD) and
British pounds (GBP). In a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap, a ﬁxed rate of interest is
1 See Technical Note 18 at www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes for the details. The ‘‘assume
forward rates are realized’’ approach works exactly if the spread used for compounding, sc, is zero or if it is
applied so that Q at time t compounds to Qð1 þ RÞð1 þ scÞ at time t þ , where R is LIBOR. If, as is more
usual, it compounds to Q½1 þ ðR þ scÞ, then there is a small approximation.
Swaps Revisited
785

speciﬁed in each currency. The payments on one side are determined by applying the
ﬁxed rate of interest in USD to the USD principal; the payments on the other side are
determined by applying the ﬁxed rate of interest in GBP to the GBP principal.
Section 7.10 discussed the valuation of this type of swap.
Other currency swaps are discussed in Section 7.11. In a ﬂoating-for-ﬂoating currency
swap, the payments on one side are determined by applying USD LIBOR (possibly
with a spread added) to the USD principal; similarly the payments on the other side are
determined by applying GBP LIBOR (possibly with a spread added) to the GBP
principal. In a cross-currency interest rate swap, a ﬂoating rate in one currency is
exchanged for a ﬁxed rate in another currency.
Floating-for-ﬂoating and cross-currency interest rate swaps can be valued using the
‘‘assume forward rates are realized’’ rule. Future LIBOR rates in each currency are
assumed to equal today’s forward rates. This enables the cash ﬂows in the currencies to
be determined. The USD cash ﬂows are discounted at the USD zero rate. The GBP
cash ﬂows are discounted at the GBP zero rate. The current exchange rate is then used
to translate the two present values to a common currency.
An adjustment to this procedure is sometimes made to reﬂect the realities of the
market. In theory, a new ﬂoating-for-ﬂoating swap should involve exchanging LIBOR
in one currency for LIBOR in another currency (with no spreads added). In practice,
macroeconomic eﬀects give rise to spreads. Financial institutions often adjust the
discount rates they use to allow for this. As an example, suppose that market conditions
are such that USD LIBOR is exchanged for Japanese yen (JPY) LIBOR minus 20 basis
points in new ﬂoating-for-ﬂoating swaps of all maturities. In its currency swap valua-
tions, a US ﬁnancial institution might discount USD cash ﬂows at USD LIBOR and
discount JPY cash ﬂows at JPY LIBOR minus 20 basis points.2 It would do this in all
swaps that involved both JPY and USD cash ﬂows.
33.4
MORE COMPLEX SWAPS
We now move on to consider some examples of swaps where the simple rule ‘‘assume
forward rates will be realized’’ does not work. In each case, it must be assumed that an
adjusted forward rate, rather than the actual forward rate, is realized. This section
builds on the discussion in Chapter 30.
LIBOR-in-Arrears Swap
A plain vanilla interest rate swap is designed so that the ﬂoating rate of interest
observed on one payment date is paid on the next payment date. An alternative
instrument that is sometimes traded is a LIBOR-in-arrears swap. In this, the ﬂoating
rate paid on a payment date equals the rate observed on the payment date itself.
Suppose that the reset dates in the swap are ti for i ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; n, with i ¼ tiþ1  ti.
Deﬁne Ri as the LIBOR rate for the period between ti and tiþ1, Fi as the forward value
of Ri, and i as the volatility of this forward rate. (The value of i is typically implied
from caplet prices.) In a LIBOR-in-arrears swap, the payment on the ﬂoating side at
2 This adjustment is ad hoc, but, if it is not made, traders make an immediate proﬁt or loss every time they
trade a new JPY/USD ﬂoating-for-ﬂoating swap.
786
CHAPTER 33

time ti is based on Ri rather than Ri1. As explained in Section 30.1, it is necessary to
make a convexity adjustment to the forward rate when the payment is valued. The
valuation should be based on the assumption that the ﬂoating rate paid is
Fi þ F2
i 2
i iti
1 þ Fii
ð33:1Þ
and not Fi.
Example 33.2
In a LIBOR-in-arrears swap, the principal is $100 million. A ﬁxed rate of 5% is
received annually and LIBOR is paid. Payments are exchanged at the ends of
years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The LIBOR/swap zero curve is used for discounting and is
ﬂat at 5% per annum (measured with annual compounding). All caplet volatilities
are 22% per annum.
The forward rate for each ﬂoating payment is 5%. If this were a regular swap
rather than an in-arrears swap, its value would (ignoring day count conventions,
etc.) be exactly zero. Because it is an in-arrears swap, convexity adjustments must
be made. In equation (33.1), Fi ¼ 0:05, i ¼ 0:22, and i ¼ 1 for all i. The con-
vexity adjustment changes the rate assumed at time ti from 0.05 to
0:05 þ 0:052  0:222  1  ti
1 þ 0:05  1
¼ 0:05 þ 0:000115ti
The ﬂoating rates for the payments at the ends of years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 should
therefore be assumed to be 5.0115%, 5.0230%, 5.0345%, 5.0460%, and 5.0575%,
respectively. The net exchange on the ﬁrst payment date is equivalent to a cash
outﬂow of 0.0115% of $100 million or $11,500. Equivalent net cash ﬂows for
other exchanges are calculated similarly. The value of the swap is
 11,500
1:05  23,000
1:052  34,500
1:053  46,000
1:054  57,500
1:055
or $144,514.
CMS and CMT Swaps
A constant maturity swap (CMS) is an interest rate swap where the ﬂoating rate equals
the swap rate for a swap with a certain life. For example, the ﬂoating payments on a CMS
swap might be made every 6 months at a rate equal to the 5-year swap rate. Usually there
is a lag so that the payment on a particular payment date is equal to the swap rate
observed on the previous payment date. Suppose that rates are set at times t0, t1, t2, . . . ,
payments are made at times t1, t2, t3, . . . , and L is the notional principal. The ﬂoating
payment at time tiþ1 is
iLSi
where i ¼ tiþ1  ti and Si is the swap rate at time ti.
Suppose that yi is the forward value of the swap rate Si. To value the payment at
time tiþ1, it turns out to be correct to make an adjustment to the forward swap rate, so
that the realized swap rate is assumed to be

rather that yi. In this equation, y;i is the volatility of the forward swap rate, Fi is the
current forward interest rate between times ti and tiþ1, F;i is the volatility of this forward
rate, and i is the correlation between the forward swap rate and the forward interest rate.
GiðxÞ is the price at time ti of a bond as a function of its yield x. The bond pays coupons at
rate yi and has the same life and payment frequency as the swap from which the CMS rate
is calculated. G0
iðxÞ and G00
i ðxÞ are the ﬁrst and second partial derivatives of Gi with
respect to x. The volatilities y;i can be implied from swaptions; the volatilities F;i can be
implied from caplet prices; the correlation i can be estimated from historical data.
Equation (33.2) involves a convexity and a timing adjustment. The term
1

G00
i ðyiÞ

iðyiÞ
is an adjustment similar the one in Example 30.2 of Section 30.1. It is based on the
assumption that the swap rate Si leads to only one payment at time ti rather than to an
annuity of payments. The term
 yiiFiiy;iF;i ti
1 þ Fii
is similar to the one in Section 30.2 and is an adjustment for the fact that the payment
calculated from Si is made at time tiþ1 rather than ti.
Example 33.3
In a 6-year CMS swap, the 5-year swap rate is received and a ﬁxed rate of 5% is
paid on a notional principal of $100 million. The exchange of payments is semi-
annual (both on the underlying 5-year swap and on the CMS swap itself). The
exchange on a payment date is determined from the swap rate on the previous
payment date. The LIBOR/swap zero curve is used for discounting and is ﬂat at
5% per annum with semiannual compounding. All options on ﬁve-year swaps
have a 15% implied volatility and all caplets with a 6-month tenor have a 20%
implied volatility. The correlation between each cap rate and each swap rate is 0.7.
In this case, yi ¼ 0:05, y;i ¼ 0:15, i ¼ 0:5, Fi ¼ 0:05, F;i ¼ 0:20, and i ¼ 0:7
for all i. Also,
GiðxÞ ¼
X

ð1 þ x=2Þ10
so that G0
iðyiÞ ¼ 437:603 and G00
i ðyiÞ ¼ 2261:23. Equation (33.2) gives the total
convexity/timing adjustment as 0:0001197ti, or 1.197 basis points per year until
the swap rate is observed. For example, for the purposes of valuing the CMS
swap, the 5-year swap rate in 4 years’ time should be assumed to be 5.0479%
rather than 5% and the net cash ﬂow received at the 4.5-year point should be
assumed to be 0:5  0:000479  100,000,000 ¼ $23,940. Other net cash ﬂows are
calculated similarly. Taking their present value, we ﬁnd the value of the swap to
be $159,811.
A constant maturity Treasury swap (CMT swap) works similarly to a CMS swap except
that the ﬂoating rate is the yield on a Treasury bond with a speciﬁed life. The analysis of
a CMT swap is essentially the same as that for a CMS swap with Si deﬁned as the par
yield on a Treasury bond with the speciﬁed life.
788
CHAPTER 33

Differential Swaps
A diﬀerential swap, sometimes referred to as a diﬀswap, is an interest rate swap where a
ﬂoating interest rate is observed in one currency and applied to a principal in another
currency. Suppose that the LIBOR rate for the period between ti and tiþ1 in currency Y
is applied to a principal in currency X with the payment taking place at time tiþ1. Deﬁne
Vi as the forward interest rate between ti and tiþ1 in currency Y and Wi as the forward
exchange rate for a contract with maturity tiþ1 (expressed as the number of units of
currency Y that equal one unit of currency X). If the LIBOR rate in currency Y were
applied to a principal in currency Y, the cash ﬂow at time tiþ1 would be valued on the
assumption that the LIBOR rate at time ti equals Vi. From the analysis in Section 30.3,
a quanto adjustment is necessary when it is applied to a principal in currency X. It is
correct to value the cash ﬂow on the assumption that the LIBOR rate equals
Vi þ ViiW;iV;iti
ð33:3Þ
where V;i is the volatility of Vi, W;i is the volatility of Wi, and i is the correlation
between Vi and Wi.
Example 33.4
In a 3-year diﬀswap agreement with annual payments, USD 12-month LIBOR is
received and sterling 12-month LIBOR is paid with both being applied to a
principal of 10 million pounds sterling. LIBOR/swap zero rates are used for
discounting and are 5% per annum (with semiannual compounding) for all
maturities. The volatility of all 1-year forward rates in the US is estimated to
be 20%, the volatility of the forward USD/sterling exchange rate (dollars per
pound) is 12% for all maturities, and the correlation between the two is 0.4.
In this case, Vi ¼ 0:05, i ¼ 0:4, W;i ¼ 0:12, V;i ¼ 0:2. The ﬂoating-rate cash
ﬂows dependent on the 1-year USD rate observed at time ti should therefore be
calculated on the assumption that the rate will be
0:05 þ 0:05  0:4  0:12  0:2  ti ¼ 0:05 þ 0:00048ti
This means that the net cash ﬂows from the swap at times 1, 2, and 3 years should
be assumed to be 0, 4,800, and 9,600 pounds sterling for the purposes of valua-
tion. The value of the swap is therefore
0
1:05 þ 4; 800
1:052 þ 9; 600
1:053 ¼ 12,647
or 12,647 pounds sterling.
33.5
EQUITY SWAPS
In an equity swap, one party promises to pay the return on an equity index on a
notional principal, while the other promises to pay a ﬁxed or ﬂoating return on a
notional principal. Equity swaps enable a fund managers to increase or reduce their
exposure to an index without buying and selling stock. An equity swap is a convenient
way of packaging a series of forward contracts on an index to meet the needs of the
market.
Swaps Revisited
789

The equity index is usually a total return index where dividends are reinvested in the
stocks comprising the index. An example of an equity swap is in Business Snapshot 33.3.
In this, the 6-month return on the S&P 500 is exchanged for LIBOR. The principal on
either side of the swap is $100 million and payments are made every 6 months.
For an equity-for-ﬂoating swap such as that in Business Snapshot 33.3, the value at
the start of its life is zero, assuming LIBOR discounting. This is because a ﬁnancial
institution can arrange to costlessly replicate the cash ﬂows to one side by borrowing
the principal on each payment date at LIBOR and investing it in the index until the next
payment date with any dividends being reinvested. A similar argument shows that the
swap is always worth zero immediately after a payment date.
Between payment dates the equity cash ﬂow and the LIBOR cash ﬂow at the next
payment date must be valued. The LIBOR cash ﬂow was ﬁxed at the last reset date and so
can be valued easily. The value of the equity cash ﬂow is LE=E0, where L is the principal,
E is the current value of the equity index, and E0 is its value at the last payment date.3

CHAPTER 33

33.6
SWAPS WITH EMBEDDED OPTIONS
Some swaps contain embedded options. In this section we consider some commonly
encountered examples.
Accrual Swaps
Accrual swaps are swaps where the interest on one side accrues only when the ﬂoating
reference rate is within a certain range. Sometimes the range remains ﬁxed during the
entire life of the swap; sometimes it is reset periodically.
As a simple example of an accrual swap, consider a deal where a ﬁxed rate Q is
exchanged for 3-month LIBOR every quarter and the ﬁxed rate accrues only on days
when 3-month LIBOR is below 8% per annum. Suppose that the principal is L. In a
normal swap the ﬁxed-rate payer would pay QLn1=n2 on each payment date where n1 is
the number of days in the preceding quarter and n2 is the number of days in the year.
(This assumes that the day count is actual/actual.) In an accrual swap, this is changed to
QLn3=n2, where n3 is the number of days in the preceding quarter that the 3-month
LIBOR was below 8%. The ﬁxed-rate payer saves QL=n2 on each day when 3-month
LIBOR is above 8%.4 The ﬁxed-rate payer’s position can therefore be considered
equivalent to a regular swap plus a series of binary options, one for each day of the
life of the swap. The binary options pay oﬀQL=n2 when the 3-month LIBOR is
above 8%.
To generalize, suppose that the LIBOR cutoﬀrate (8% in the case just considered) is
RK and that payments are exchanged every  years. Consider day i during the life of the
swap and suppose that ti is the time until day i. Suppose that the -year LIBOR rate on
day i is Ri so that interest accrues when Ri < RK. Deﬁne Fi as the forward value of Ri
and i as the volatility of Fi. (The latter is estimated from spot caplet volatilities.) Using
the usual lognormal assumption, the probability that LIBOR is greater than RK in a
world that is forward risk neutral with respect to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time
ti þ  is Nðd2Þ, where

The payoﬀfrom the binary option is realized at the swap payment date following
day i. Suppose that this is at time si. The probability that LIBOR is greater than RK
in a world that is forward risk neutral with respect to a zero-coupon bond maturing at
time si is given by Nðd 

with a small timing adjustment to Fi reﬂecting the diﬀerence between time ti þ  and

day in the life of the swap. The timing adjustment (causing d2 to be replaced by d 
2 ) is so
small that, in practice, it is frequently ignored.
Cancelable Swap
A cancelable swap is a plain vanilla interest rate swap where one side has the option to
terminate on one or more payment dates. Terminating a swap is the same as entering
into the oﬀsetting (opposite) swap. Consider a swap between Microsoft and Goldman
Sachs. If Microsoft has the option to cancel, it can regard the swap as a regular swap
plus a long position in an option to enter into the oﬀsetting swap. If Goldman Sachs
has the cancelation option, Microsoft has a regular swap plus a short position in an
option to enter into the swap.
If there is only one termination date, a cancelable swap is the same as a regular swap
plus a position in a European swaption. Consider, for example, a 10-year swap where
Microsoft will receive 6% and pay LIBOR. Suppose that Microsoft has the option to
terminate at the end of 6 years. The swap is a regular 10-year swap to receive 6% and
pay LIBOR plus long position in a 6-year European option to enter into a 4-year swap
where 6% is paid and LIBOR is received. (The latter is referred to as a 6  4 European
swaption.) The standard market model for valuing European swaptions is described in
Chapter 29.
When the swap can be terminated on a number of diﬀerent payment dates, it is a
regular swap plus a Bermudan-style swaption. Consider, for example, the situation
where Microsoft has entered into a 5-year swap with semiannual payments where 6% is
received and LIBOR is paid. Suppose that the counterparty has the option to terminate
the swap on payment dates between year 2 and year 5. The swap is a regular swap plus a
short position in a Bermudan-style swaption, where the Bermudan-style swaption is an
option to enter into a swap that matures in 5 years and involves a ﬁxed payment at 6%
being received and a ﬂoating payment at LIBOR being paid. The swaption can be
exercised on any payment date between year 2 and year 5. Methods for valuing
Bermudan swaptions are discussed in Chapters 31 and 32.
Cancelable Compounding Swaps
Sometimes compounding swaps can be terminated on speciﬁed payment dates. On
termination, the ﬂoating-rate payer pays the compounded value of the ﬂoating amounts
up to the time of termination and the ﬁxed-rate payer pays the compounded value of
the ﬁxed payments up to the time of termination.
Some tricks can be used to value cancelable compounding swaps. Suppose ﬁrst that
the ﬂoating rate is LIBOR, it is compounded at LIBOR, and LIBOR discounting is
used. Assume that the principal amount of the swap is paid on both the ﬁxed and
ﬂoating sides of the swap at the end of its life. This is similar to moving from Table 7.1
to Table 7.2 for a vanilla swap. It does not change the value of the swap and has the
eﬀect of ensuring that the value of the ﬂoating side is always equals the notional
principal on a payment date. To make the cancelation decision, we need only look at
the ﬁxed side. We construct an interest rate tree as outlined in Chapter 31. We roll back
through the tree in the usual way valuing the ﬁxed side. At each node where the swap
can be canceled, we test whether it is optimal to keep the swap or cancel it. Canceling
the swap in eﬀect sets the ﬁxed side equal to par. If we are paying ﬁxed and receiving
792
CHAPTER 33

ﬂoating, our objective is to minimize the value of the ﬁxed side; if we are receiving ﬁxed
and paying ﬂoating, our objective is to maximize the value of the ﬁxed side.
When the ﬂoating side is LIBOR plus a spread compounded at LIBOR, the cash
ﬂows corresponding to the spread rate of interest can be subtracted from the ﬁxed side
instead of adding them to the ﬂoating side. The option can then be valued as in the case
where there is no spread.
When the compounding is at LIBOR plus a spread, an approximate approach is as
follows:5
1. Calculate the value of the ﬂoating side of the swap at each cancelation date
assuming forward rates are realized.
2. Calculate the value of the ﬂoating side of the swap at each cancelation date
assuming that the ﬂoating rate is LIBOR and it is compounded at LIBOR.
3. Deﬁne the excess of step 1 over step 2 as the ‘‘value of spreads’’ on a cancelation date.
4. Treat the option in the way described above. In deciding whether to exercise the
cancelation option, subtract the value of the spreads from the values calculated for
the ﬁxed side.
A similar approach can be used for OIS discounting if the spread between OIS and
LIBOR is assumed to be equal to the forward spread.
33.7
OTHER SWAPS
This chapter has discussed just a few of the swap structures in the market. In practice, the
range of diﬀerent contracts that trade is limited only by the imagination of ﬁnancial
engineers and the appetite of corporate treasurers for innovative risk management tools.
A swap that was very popular in the United States in the mid-1990s is an index
amortizing rate swap (also called an indexed principal swap). In this, the principal reduces
in a way dependent on the level of interest rates. The lower the interest rate, the greater the
reduction in the principal. The ﬁxed side of an indexed amortizing swap was originally
designed to mirror approximately the return obtained by an investor on an agency
mortgage-backed security after prepayment options are taken into account. The swap
therefore exchanged the return on the mortgage-backed security for a ﬂoating-rate return.
Commodity swaps are now becoming increasingly popular. A company that consumes
100,000 barrels of oil per year could agree to pay $8 million each year for the next 10 years
and to receive in return 100,000S, where S is the market price of oil per barrel. The
agreement would in eﬀect lock in the company’s oil cost at $80 per barrel. An oil
producer might agree to the opposite exchange, thereby locking in the price it realized
for its oil at $80 per barrel. Energy derivatives such as this will be discussed in Chapter 34.
A number of other types of swaps are discussed elsewhere in this book. For example,
asset swaps are discussed in Chapter 24, total return swaps and various types of credit
default swaps are covered in Chapter 25, and volatility and variance swaps are analyzed
in Chapter 26.
5 This approach is not perfectly accurate in that it assumes that the decision to exercise the cancelation
option is not inﬂuenced by future payments being compounded at a rate diﬀerent from LIBOR.

Bizarre Deals
Some swaps have payoﬀs that are calculated in quite bizarre ways. An example is a deal
entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers Trust in 1993 (see Business
Snapshot 33.4). The details of this transaction are in the public domain because it later
became the subject of litigation.6
SUMMARY
Swaps have proved to be very versatile ﬁnancial instruments. Many swaps can be valued
by (a) assuming that LIBOR (or some other ﬂoating reference rate) will equal its
forward value and (b) discounting the resulting cash ﬂows. These include plain vanilla
interest swaps, most types of currency swaps, swaps where the principal changes in a
predetermined way, swaps where the payment dates are diﬀerent on each side, and
compounding swaps.
Business Snapshot 33.4
Procter and Gamble’s Bizarre Deal
A particularly bizarre swap is the so-called ‘‘5/30’’ swap entered into between Bankers
Trust (BT) and Procter and Gamble (P&G) on November 2, 1993. This was a 5-year
swap with semiannual payments. The notional principal was $200 million. BT paid
P&G 5.30% per annum. P&G paid BT the average 30-day CP (commercial paper)
rate minus 75 basis points plus a spread. The average commercial paper rate was
calculated by taking observations on the 30-day commercial paper rate each day
during the preceding accrual period and averaging them.
The spread was zero for the ﬁrst payment date (May 2, 1994). For the remaining
nine payment dates, it was
max 0;

In this, 5-year CMT is the constant maturity Treasury yield (i.e., the yield on a 5-year
Treasury note, as reported by the US Federal Reserve). The 30-year TSY price is the
midpoint of the bid and oﬀer cash bond prices for the 6.25% Treasury bond
maturing on August 2023. Note that the spread calculated from the formula is a
decimal interest rate. It is not measured in basis points. If the formula gives 0.1 and
the CP rate is 6%, the rate paid by P&G is 15.25%.
P&G were hoping that the spread would be zero and the deal would enable it to
exchange ﬁxed-rate funding at 5.30% for funding at 75 basis points less than the
commercial paper rate. In fact, interest rates rose sharply in early 1994, bond prices
fell, and the swap proved very, very expensive (see Problem 33.10).

Leveraged Swap,’’ Journal of Derivatives 4, 4 (Summer 1997): 67–79.
794
CHAPTER 33

Some swaps require adjustments to the forward rates when they are valued. These
adjustments are termed convexity, timing, or quanto adjustments. Among the swaps that
require adjustments are LIBOR-in-arrears, CMS/CMT, and diﬀerential swaps.
Equity swaps involve the return on an equity index being exchanged for a ﬁxed or
ﬂoating rate of interest. They are usually designed so that they are worth zero immediately
after a payment date, but they may have nonzero values between payment dates.
Some swaps involve embedded options. An accrual swap is a regular swap plus a
large portfolio of binary options (one for each day of the life of the swap). A cancelable
swap is a regular swap plus a Bermudan swaption.

Practice Questions (Answers in Solutions Manual)
33.1. Calculate all the ﬁxed cash ﬂows and their exact timing for the swap in Business
Snapshot 33.1. Assume that the day count conventions are applied using target payment
dates rather than actual payment dates.
33.2. Suppose that a swap speciﬁes that a ﬁxed rate is exchanged for twice the LIBOR rate.
Can the swap be valued using the ‘‘assume forward rates are realized’’ rule?
33.3. What is the value of a 2-year ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating compounding swap where the principal is
$100 million and payments are made semiannually? Fixed interest is received and
ﬂoating is paid. The ﬁxed rate is 8% and it is compounded at 8.3% (both semiannually
compounded). The ﬂoating rate is LIBOR plus 10 basis points and it is compounded at
LIBOR plus 20 basis points. The LIBOR zero curve is ﬂat at 8% with semiannual
compounding (and is used for discounting).
33.4. What is the value of a 5-year swap where LIBOR is paid in the usual way and in return
LIBOR compounded at LIBOR is received on the other side? The principal on both
sides is $100 million. Payment dates on the pay side and compounding dates on the
receive side are every 6 months. The LIBOR zero curve is ﬂat at 5% with semiannual
compounding (and is used for discounting).
33.5. Explain carefully why a bank might choose to discount cash ﬂows on a currency swap at
a rate slightly diﬀerent from LIBOR.
33.6. Calculate the total convexity/timing adjustment in Example 33.3 of Section 33.4 if all
cap volatilities are 18% instead of 20% and volatilities for all options on 5-year swaps
are 13% instead of 15%. What should the 5-year swap rate in 3 years’ time be assumed
for the purpose of valuing the swap? What is the value of the swap?
33.7. Explain why a plain vanilla interest rate swap and the compounding swap in Section 33.2

33.8. In the accrual swap discussed in the text, the ﬁxed side accrues only when the ﬂoating

33.9. LIBOR zero rates are ﬂat at 5% in the United States and ﬂat at 10% in Australia (both
annually compounded). In a 4-year diﬀswap Australian LIBOR is received and 9% is
paid with both being applied to a USD principal of $10 million. Payments are exchanged
annually. The volatility of all 1-year forward rates in Australia is estimated to be 25%,

is 6.5% and the Treasury yield curve is ﬂat at 6% and (b) the CP rate is 7.5% and the
Treasury yield curve is ﬂat at 7% with semiannual compounding.
33.11. Suppose that you are trading a LIBOR-in-arrears swap with an unsophisticated counter-
party who does not make convexity adjustments. To take advantage of the situation,

CHAPTER 33

Energy and
Commodity
Derivatives
The variable underlying a derivative is sometimes simply referred to as the underlying.
Earlier parts of this book have focused on situations where the underlying is a stock
price, a stock index, an exchange rate, a bond price, an interest rate, or the loss from a
credit event. In this chapter, we consider a variety of other underlyings.
The ﬁrst part of the chapter is concerned with situations where the underlying is a
commodity. Chapter 2 discussed futures contracts on commodities and Chapter 18
discussed how European and American options on commodity futures contracts can
be valued. As a European futures option has the same payoﬀas a European spot
option when the futures contract matures at the same time as the option, the model
used to value European futures options (Black’s model) can also be used to value
European spot options. However, American spot options and other more complicated
derivatives dependent on the spot price of a commodity require more sophisticated
models. A feature of commodity prices is that they often exhibit mean reversion
(similarly to interest rates) and are also sometimes subject to jumps. Some of the
models developed for interest rates can be adapted to apply to commodities.
The second part of the chapter considers weather and insurance derivatives. A
distinctive feature of these derivatives is that they depend on variables with no systematic
risk. For example, the expected value of the temperature at a certain location or the
losses experienced due to hurricanes can reasonably be assumed to be the same in a risk-
neutral world and the real world. This means that historical data is potentially more
useful for valuing these types of derivatives than for some others.
34.1
AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES
Agricultural commodities include products that are grown (or created from products
that are grown) such as corn, wheat, soybeans, cocoa, coﬀee, sugar, cotton, and frozen
orange juice. They also include products related to livestock such as cattle, hogs, and
pork bellies. The prices of agricultural commodities, like all commodities, is determined
by supply and demand. The United States Department of Agriculture publishes reports
on inventories and production. One statistic that is watched for commodities such as
797
34
C H A P T E R

corn and wheat is the stocks-to-use ratio. This is the ratio of the year-end inventory to
the year’s usage. Typically it is between 20% and 40%. It has an impact on price
volatility. As the ratio for a commodity becomes lower, the commodity’s price becomes
more sensitive to supply changes, so that the volatility increases.
There are reasons for supposing some level of mean reversion in agricultural prices.
As prices decline, farmers ﬁnd it less attractive to produce the commodity and supply
decreases creating upward pressure on the price. Similarly, as the price of an agricul-
tural commodity increases, farmers are more likely to devote resources to producing the
commodity creating downward pressure on the price.
Prices of agricultural commodities tend to be seasonal, as storage is expensive and
there is a limit to the length of time for which a product can be stored. Weather plays a
key role in determining the price of many agricultural products. Frosts can decimate the
Brazilian coﬀee crop, a hurricane in Florida is likely to have a big eﬀect on the price of
frozen orange juice, and so on. The volatility of the price of a commodity that is grown
tends to be highest at pre-harvest times and then declines when the size of the crop is
known. During the growing season, the price process for an agricultural commodity is
liable to exhibit jumps because of the weather.
Many of the commodities that are grown and traded are used to feed livestock. (For
example, the corn futures contract that is traded by the CME Group refers to the corn
that is used to feed animals.) The price of livestock, and when slaughtering takes place,
is liable to be dependent on the price of these commodities, which are in turn inﬂuenced
by the weather.
34.2
METALS
Another important commodity category is metals. This includes gold, silver, platinum,
palladium, copper, tin, lead, zinc, nickel, and aluminum. Metals have quite diﬀerent
characteristics from agricultural commodities. Their prices are unaﬀected by the
weather and are not seasonal. They are extracted from the ground. They are divisible
and are relatively easy to store. Some metals, such as copper, are used almost entirely in
the manufacture of goods and should be classiﬁed as consumption assets. As explained
in Section 5.1, others, such as gold and silver, are held purely for investment as well as
for consumption and should be classiﬁed as investment assets.
As in the case of agricultural commodities, analysts monitor inventory levels to
determine short-term price volatility. Exchange rate volatility may also contribute to
volatility as the country where the metal is extracted is often diﬀerent from the country
in whose currency the price is quoted. In the long term, the price of a metal is
determined by trends in the extent to which a metal is used in diﬀerent production
processes and new sources of the metal that are found. Changes in exploration and
extraction methods, geopolitics, cartels, and environmental regulation also have an
impact.
One potential source of supply for a metal is recycling. A metal might be used to
create a product and, over the following 20 years, 10% of the metal might come back on
the market as a result of a recycling process.
Metals that are investment assets are not usually assumed to follow mean-reverting
processes because a mean-reverting process would give rise to an arbitrage opportunity
for the investor. For metals that are consumption assets, there may be some mean
798
CHAPTER 34

reversion. As the price of a metal increases, it is likely to become less attractive to use
the metal in some production processes and more economically viable to extract the
metal from diﬃcult locations. As a result there will be downward pressure on the price.
Similarly, as the price decreases, it is likely to become more attractive to use the metal in
some production processes and less economically viable to extract the metal from
diﬃcult locations. As a result, there will be upward pressure on the price.
34.3
ENERGY PRODUCTS
Energy products are among the most important and actively traded commodities.
A wide range of energy derivatives trade in both the over-the-counter market and on
exchanges. Here we consider oil, natural gas, and electricity. There are reasons for
supposing that all three follow mean reverting processes. As the price of a source of
energy rises, it is likely to be consumed less and and produced more. This creates a
downward pressure on prices. As the price of a source of energy declines, it is likely to
be consumed more, but production is likely to be less economically viable. This creates
upward pressure on the price.
Crude Oil
The crude oil market is the largest commodity market in the world, with global demand
amounting to about 80 million barrels daily. Ten-year ﬁxed-price supply contracts have
been commonplace in the over-the-counter market for many years. These are swaps
where oil at a ﬁxed price is exchanged for oil at a ﬂoating price.
There are many grades of crude oil, reﬂecting variations in the gravity and the sulfur
content. Two important benchmarks for pricing are Brent crude oil (which is sourced
from the North Sea) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Crude oil is reﬁned
into products such as gasoline, heating oil, fuel oil, and kerosene.
In the over-the-counter market, virtually any derivative that is available on common
stocks or stock indices is now available with oil as the underlying asset. Swaps, forward
contracts, and options are popular. Contracts sometimes require settlement in cash and
sometimes require settlement by physical delivery (i.e., by delivery of oil).
Exchange-traded contracts are also popular. The CME Group and Intercontinental-
Exchange (ICE) trade a number of oil futures and oil futures options contracts. Some of
the futures contracts are settled in cash; others are settled by physical delivery. For
example, the Brent crude oil futures traded on ICE have a cash settlement option; the
light sweet crude oil futures traded on CME Group require physical delivery. In both
cases, the amount of oil underlying one contract is 1,000 barrels. The CME Group also
trades popular contracts on two reﬁned products: heating oil and gasoline. In both
cases, one contract is for the delivery of 42,000 gallons.
Natural Gas
The natural gas industry throughout the world went through a period of deregulation
and the elimination of government monopolies in the 1980s and 1990s. The supplier of
natural gas is now not necessarily the same company as the producer of the gas.
Suppliers are faced with the problem of meeting daily demand.
Energy and Commodity Derivatives
799

A typical over-the-counter contract is for the delivery of a speciﬁed amount of
natural gas at a roughly uniform rate over a 1-month period. Forward contracts,
options, and swaps are available in the over-the-counter market. The seller of natural
gas is usually responsible for moving the gas through pipelines to the speciﬁed
location.
The CME Group trades a contract for the delivery of 10,000 million British thermal
units of natural gas. The contract, if not closed out, requires physical delivery to be
made during the delivery month at a roughly uniform rate to a particular hub in
Louisiana. ICE trades a similar contract in London.
Natural gas is a popular source of energy for heating buildings. It is also used to
produce electricity, which in turn is used for air-conditioning. As a result, demand for
natural gas is seasonal and dependent on the weather.
Electricity
Electricity is an unusual commodity because it cannot easily be stored.1 The maximum
supply of electricity in a region at any moment is determined by the maximum capacity
of all the electricity-producing plants in the region. In the United States there are
140 regions known as control areas. Demand and supply are ﬁrst matched within a
control area, and any excess power is sold to other control areas. It is this excess power
that constitutes the wholesale market for electricity. The ability of one control area to
sell power to another control area depends on the transmission capacity of the lines
between the two areas. Transmission from one area to another involves a transmission
cost, charged by the owner of the line, and there are generally some transmission or
energy losses.
A major use of electricity is for air-conditioning systems. As a result the demand for
electricity, and therefore its price, is much greater in the summer months than in the
winter months. The nonstorability of electricity causes occasional very large movements
in the spot price. Heat waves have been known to increase the spot price by as much as
1,000% for short periods of time.
Like natural gas, electricity has been through a period of deregulation and the
elimination of government monopolies. This has been accompanied by the development
of an electricity derivatives market. The CME Group now trades a futures contract on
the price of electricity, and there is an active over-the-counter market in forward
contracts, options, and swaps. A typical contract (exchange-traded or over-the-counter)
allows one side to receive a speciﬁed number of megawatt hours for a speciﬁed price at a
speciﬁed location during a particular month. In a 5  8 contract, power is received for
ﬁve days a week (Monday to Friday) during the oﬀ-peak period (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.) for
the speciﬁed month. In a 5  16 contract, power is received ﬁve days a week during the
on-peak period (7 a.m. to 11 p.m.) for the speciﬁed month. In a 7  24 contract, it is
received around the clock every day during the month. Option contracts have either
daily exercise or monthly exercise. In the case of daily exercise, the option holder can
choose on each day of the month (by giving one day’s notice) whether to receive the
speciﬁed amount of power at the speciﬁed strike price. When there is monthly exercise a

plants so that it can be used to produce electricity at a later time. This is the closest they can get to storing this
commodity.

CHAPTER 34

single decision on whether to receive power for the whole month at the speciﬁed strike
price is made at the beginning of the month.
An interesting contract in electricity and natural gas markets is what is known as a
swing option or take-and-pay option. In this contract, a minimum and maximum for the
amount of power that must be purchased at a certain price by the option holder is
speciﬁed for each day during a month and for the month in total. The option holder
can change (or swing) the rate at which the power is purchased during the month, but
usually there is a limit on the total number of changes that can be made.
34.4
MODELING COMMODITY PRICES
To value derivatives, we are often interested in modeling the spot price of a commodity
in the traditional risk-neutral world. From Section 18.7, the expected future price of the
commodity in this world is the futures price.
A Simple Process
A simple process for a commodity price can be constructed by assuming that the expected
growth rate in the commodity price is dependent solely on time and the volatility of the
commodity price is constant. The risk-neutral process for the commodity price S then
has the form
dS
S ¼ ðtÞ dt þ  dz
ð34:1Þ
and
FðtÞ ¼ ^E½SðtÞ ¼ Sð0Þe

where FðtÞ is the futures price for a contract with maturity t and ^E denotes expected
value in a risk-neutral world. It follows that

These can be used to estimate the expected growth rate in live cattle prices in a
risk-neutral world. For example, when the model in equation (34.1) is used, the

expected growth rate in live cattle prices between October and December 2014, in
a risk-neutral world is

or 3.4% per 2 months with continuous compounding. On an annualized basis,
this is 20.4% per annum.
Example 34.2
Suppose that the futures prices of live cattle are as in Example 34.1. A certain
breeding decision would involve an investment of $100,000 now and expenditures
of $20,000 in 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The result is expected to be that
an extra cattle will be available for sale at the end of the year. There are two major
uncertainties: the number of pounds of extra cattle that will be available for sale
and the price per pound. The expected number of pounds is 300,000. The expected
price of cattle in 1 year in a risk-neutral world is, from Example 34.1, 64.40 cents
per pound. Assuming that the risk-free rate of interest is 10% per annum, the value
of the investment (in thousands of dollars) is
100  20e0:10:25  20e0:10:50  20e0:10:75 þ 300  0:644e0:11 ¼ 17:729
This assumes that any uncertainty about the extra amount of cattle that will be
available for sale has zero systematic risk and that there is no correlation between
the amount of cattle that will be available for sale and the price.
Mean Reversion
As already discussed, most commodity prices follow mean-reverting processes. They
tend to get pulled back to a central value. A more realistic process than equation (34.1)
for the risk-neutral process followed by the commodity price S is
d ln S ¼ ½ðtÞ  a ln S dt þ  dz
ð34:2Þ
This incorporates mean reversion and is analogous to the lognormal process assumed for
the short-term interest rate in Chapter 31. Note that this process is sometimes written
dS
S ¼ ½ðtÞ  a ln S dt þ  dz
From Itoˆ ’s lemma, this is equivalent to the process in equation (34.2) when ðtÞ ¼
ðtÞ þ 1
22.
The trinomial tree methodology in Section 31.7 can be adapted to construct a tree for
S and determine the value of ðtÞ in equation (34.2) such that FðtÞ ¼ ^E½SðtÞ. We will
illustrate the procedure by building a three-step tree for the situation where the current
spot price is $20 and the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year futures prices are $22, $23, and $24,
respectively. Suppose that a ¼ 0:1 and  ¼ 0:2 in equation (34.2). We ﬁrst deﬁne a
variable X that is initially zero and follows the process
dX ¼ aX dt þ  dz
ð34:3Þ
Using the procedure in Section 31.7, a trinomial tree can be constructed for X. This is
shown in Figure 34.1.
802
CHAPTER 34

The variable ln S follows the same process as X except for a time-dependent drift.
Analogously to Section 31.7, the tree for X can be converted to a tree for ln S by
displacing the positions of nodes. This tree is shown in Figure 34.2. The initial node
corresponds to a price of 20, so the displacement for that node is ln 20. Suppose that the
displacement of the nodes at 1 year is 1. The values of the X at the three nodes at the
1-year point are þ0:3464, 0, and 0:3464. The corresponding values of ln S are
0:3464 þ 1, 1, and 0:3464 þ 1. The values of S are therefore e0:3464þ1, e1, and
e0:3464þ1, respectively. We require the expected value of S to equal the futures price.
This means that
0:1667e0:3464þ1 þ 0:6666e1 þ 0:1667e0:3464þ1 ¼ 22
The solution to this is 1 ¼ 3:071. The values of S at the 1-year point are therefore
30.49, 21.56, and 15.25.
At the 2-year point, we ﬁrst calculate the probabilities of nodes E, F, G, H, and I being
reached from the probabilities of nodes B, C, and D being reached. The probability of
reaching node F is the probability of reaching node B times the probability of moving
from B to F plus the probability of reaching node C times the probability of moving from
C to F. This is
0:1667  0:6566 þ 0:6666  0:1667 ¼ 0:2206
Similarly the probabilities of reaching nodes E, G, H, and I are 0.0203, 0.5183, 0.2206,
and 0.0203, respectively. The amount 2 by which the nodes at time 2 years are

are 44.35, 31.37, 22.18, 15.69, and 11.10, respectively.
A similar calculation can be carried out at time 3 years. Figure 34.2 shows the
resulting tree for S.
Example 34.3
Suppose that the tree in Figure 34.2 is used to price a 3-year American put option
on the spot price of the commodity with a strike price of 20 when the interest rate
(continuously compounded) is 3% per year. Rolling back through the tree in the
usual way, we obtain Figure 34.3 showing that the value of the option is $1.48.
The option is exercised early at nodes D, H, and I. To obtain a more accurate
value, a tree with many more time steps would be used. The futures prices would
be interpolated to obtain futures prices for maturities corresponding to the end of
every time step on this more detailed tree.
Interpolation and Seasonality
When a large number of time steps are used, it is necessary to interpolate between
futures prices to obtain a futures price at the end of each time step. When there is
seasonality, the interpolation procedure should reﬂect this. Suppose there are monthly

time steps. One simple way of incorporating seasonality is to collect monthly historical
data on the spot price and calculate the 12-month moving average of the price.
A percentage seasonal factor can then be estimated as the average of the ratio of the
spot price for the month to the 12-month moving average of spot prices that is centered
(approximately) on the month.
The percentage seasonal factors are then used to deseasonalize the futures prices
that are known. Monthly deseasonalized futures are then calculated using interpola-
tion. These futures prices are then seasonalized using the percentage seasonal factors
and the tree is built. Suppose, for example, that the futures prices are observed in the
market for September and December as 40 and 44, respectively, and we want to
calculate a futures prices for October and November. Suppose further that the
percentage seasonality factors for September, October, November, and December
are calculated from historical data as 0.95, 0.85, 0.8 and 1.1, respectively. The
deseasonalized futures prices are 40=0:95 ¼ 42:1 for September and 44=1:1 ¼ 40 for
December. The interpolated deseasonalized futures prices are 41.4 and 40.7 for
October and November, respectively. The seasonalized futures prices that would be
used in tree construction for October and November are 41:4  0:85 ¼ 35:2 and
40:7  0:8 ¼ 32:6, respectively.
As has been mentioned, the volatility of a commodity sometimes shows seasonality.
For example, the prices of some agricultural commodities are more volatile during the
growing season because of weather uncertainty. Volatility can be monitored using the
methods discussed in Chapter 23, and a percentage seasonal factor for volatility can
be estimated. The parameter  can then be replaced by ðtÞ in equations (34.2)
and (34.3). A procedure that can be used to construct a trinomial tree for the situation

www.rotman.utoronto.ca/hull/TechnicalNotes.
Jumps
Some commmodities, such as electricity and natural gas, exhibit price jumps because of
weather-related demand shocks. Other commodities, particularly those that are agri-
cultural, are liable to exhibit price jumps because of weather-related supply shocks.
Jumps can be incorporated into equation (34.2) so that the process for the spot price
becomes
d ln S ¼ ½ðtÞ  a ln S dt þ  dz þ dp
where dp is the Poisson process generating the percentage jumps. This is similar to
Merton’s mixed jump–diﬀusion model for stock prices, which is described in Sec-
tion 27.1. Once the jump frequency and jump size probability distribution have been
chosen, the average increase in the commodity price at a future time t that is as a result
of jumps can be calculated. To determine ðtÞ, the trinomial tree method can be used
with the futures prices for maturity t reduced by this increase. Monte Carlo simulation
can be used to implement the model, as explained in Sections 21.6 and 27.1.
Other Models
More-sophisticated models are sometimes used for oil prices. If y is the convenience
yield, then the proportional drift of the spot price is r  y, where r is the short-term
risk-free rate and a natural process to assume for the spot price is
dS
S ¼ ðr  yÞ dt þ 1 dz1
Gibson and Schwartz suggest that the convenience yield y be modeled as a mean-
reverting process:2
dy ¼ kð  yÞdt þ 2 dz2
where k and  are constants and dz2 is a Wiener process, which is correlated with the
Wiener process dz1. To provide an exact ﬁt to futures prices,  can be made a function
of time.
Eydeland and Geman propose a stochastic volatility for gas and electricity prices.3

34.5
WEATHER DERIVATIVES
Many companies are in the position where their performance is liable to be adversely
aﬀected by the weather.5 It makes sense for these companies to consider hedging their
weather risk in much the same way as they hedge foreign exchange or interest rate risks.
The ﬁrst over-the-counter weather derivatives were introduced in 1997. To under-
stand how they work, we explain two variables:
HDD:
Heating degree days
CDD:
Cooling degree days
A day’s HDD is deﬁned as
HDD ¼ maxð0; 65  AÞ
and a day’s CDD is deﬁned as
CDD ¼ maxð0; A  65Þ
where A is the average of the highest and lowest temperature during the day at a
speciﬁed weather station, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the max-
imum temperature during a day (midnight to midnight) is 68 Fahrenheit and the
minimum temperature is 44 Fahrenheit, A ¼ 56. The daily HDD is then 9 and the
daily CDD is 0.
A typical over-the-counter product is a forward or option contract providing a payoﬀ
dependent on the cumulative HDD or CDD during a month. For example, a deriva-
tives dealer could in January 2014 sell a client a call option on the cumulative HDD
during February 2015 at the Chicago O’Hare Airport weather station with a strike price
of 700 and a payment rate of $10,000 per degree day. If the actual cumulative HDD is
820, the payoﬀis $1.2 million. Often contracts include a payment cap. If the payment
cap in our example is $1.5 million, the contract is the equivalent of a bull spread (see
Chapter 12). The client has a long call option on cumulative HDD with a strike price of
700 and a short call option with a strike price of 850.
A day’s HDD is a measure of the volume of energy required for heating during the
day. A day’s CDD is a measure of the volume of energy required for cooling during the
day. Most weather derivative contracts are entered into by energy producers and energy
consumers. But retailers, supermarket chains, food and drink manufacturers, health
service companies, agriculture companies, and companies in the leisure industry are
also potential users of weather derivatives. The Weather Risk Management Association
(www.wrma.org) has been formed to serve the interests of the weather risk manage-
ment industry.
In September 1999 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) began trading weather
futures and European options on weather futures. The contracts are on the cumulative
HDD and CDD for a month observed at a weather station. The contracts are settled in
cash just after the end of the month once the HDD and CDD are known. One futures
contract is on $20 times the cumulative HDD or CDD for the month. The CME now
oﬀers weather futures and options for many cities throughout the world. It also oﬀers
futures and options on hurricanes, frost, and snowfall.
5 The US Department of Energy has estimated that one-seventh of the US economy is subject to weather risk.
Energy and Commodity Derivatives

34.6
INSURANCE DERIVATIVES
When derivative contracts are used for hedging purposes, they have many of the same
characteristics as insurance contracts. Both types of contracts are designed to provide
protection against adverse events. It is not surprising that many insurance companies
have subsidiaries that trade derivatives and that many of the activities of insurance
companies are becoming very similar to those of investment banks.
Traditionally the insurance industry has hedged its exposure to catastrophic (CAT)
risks such as hurricanes and earthquakes using a practice known as reinsurance.
Reinsurance contracts can take a number of forms. Suppose that an insurance company
has an exposure of $100 million to earthquakes in California and wants to limit this to
$30 million. One alternative is to enter into annual reinsurance contracts that cover on a
pro rata basis 70% of its exposure. If California earthquake claims in a particular year
total $50 million, the costs to the company would then be only $15 million. Another
more popular alternative, involving lower reinsurance premiums, is to buy a series of
reinsurance contracts covering what are known as excess cost layers. The ﬁrst layer might
provide indemniﬁcation for losses between $30 million and $40 million; the next might
cover losses between $40 million and $50 million; and so on. Each reinsurance contract is
known as an excess-of-loss reinsurance contract. The reinsurer has written a bull spread
on the total losses. It is long a call option with a strike price equal to the lower end of the
layer and short a call option with a strike price equal to the upper end of the layer.6
Some payouts on CAT risks have been very high. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 caused
about $15 billion of insurance costs in Florida. This exceeded the total of relevant
insurance premiums received in Florida during the previous seven years. If Hurricane
Andrew had hit Miami, it is estimated that insured losses would have exceeded
$40 billion. Hurricane Andrew and other catastrophes have led to increases in insur-
ance/reinsurance premiums.
The over-the-counter market has come up with a number of products that are
alternatives to traditional reinsurance. The most popular is a CAT bond. This is a bond
issued by a subsidiary of an insurance company that pays a higher-than-normal interest
rate. In exchange for the extra interest the holder of the bond agrees to provide an excess-
of-loss reinsurance contract. Depending on the terms of the CAT bond, the interest or
principal (or both) can be used to meet claims. In the example considered above where
an insurance company wants protection for California earthquake losses between
$30 million and $40 million, the insurance company could issue CAT bonds with a
total principal of $10 million. In the event that the insurance company’s California
earthquake losses exceeded $30 million, bondholders would lose some or all of their
principal. As an alternative the insurance company could cover this excess cost layer by
making a much bigger bond issue where only the bondholders’ interest is at risk.
34.7
PRICING WEATHER AND INSURANCE DERIVATIVES
One distinctive feature of weather and insurance derivatives is that there is no systematic
risk (i.e., risk that is priced by the market) in their payoﬀs. This means that estimates
6 Reinsurance is also sometimes oﬀered in the form of a lump sum if a certain loss level is reached. The
reinsurer is then writing a cash-or-nothing binary call option on the losses.
808
CHAPTER 34

made from historical data (real-world estimates) can also be assumed to apply to the
risk-neutral world. Weather and insurance derivatives can therefore be priced by
1. Using historical data to estimate the expected payoﬀ
2. Discounting the estimated expected payoﬀat the risk-free rate.
Another key feature of weather and insurance derivatives is the way uncertainty about
the underlying variables grows with time. For a stock price, uncertainty grows roughly
as the square root of time. Our uncertainty about a stock price in 4 years (as measured
by the standard deviation of the logarithm of the price) is approximately twice that in 1
year. For a commodity price, mean reversion kicks in, but our uncertainty about a
commodity’s price in 4 years is still considerably greater than our uncertainty in 1 year.
For weather, the growth of uncertainty with time is much less marked. Our uncertainty
about the February HDD at a certain location in 4 years is usually only a little greater
than our uncertainty about the February HDD at the same location in 1 year.
Similarly, our uncertainty about earthquake losses for a period starting in 4 years is
usually only a little greater than our uncertainty about earthquake losses for a similar
period starting in 1 year.
Consider the valuation of an option on the cumulative HDD. We could collect
50 years of historical data and estimate a probability distribution for the HDD. This
could be ﬁtted to a lognormal or other probability distribution and the expected payoﬀ
on the option calculated. This would then be discounted at the risk-free rate to give the
value of the option. The analysis could be reﬁned by analyzing trends in the historical
data and incorporating weather forecasts produced by meteorologists.
Example 34.4
Consider a call option on the cumulative HDD in February 2016 at the Chicago
O’Hare Airport weather station with a strike price of 700 and a payment rate of
$10,000 per degree day. Suppose that the HDD is estimated from 50 years of
historical data to have a lognormal distribution with the mean HDD equal to
710 and the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of HDD equal to 0.07.
From equation (15A.1), the expected payoﬀis
10,000  ½710Nðd1Þ  700Nðd2Þ
where
d1 ¼ lnð710=700Þ þ 0:072=2
0:07
¼ 0:2376
d2 ¼ lnð710=700Þ  0:072=2
0:07
¼ 0:1676
or $250,900. If the risk-free interest rate is 3% and the option is being valued in
February 2015 (one year from maturity) the value of the option is
250,900  e0:031 ¼ 243,400
or $243,400.
We might want to adjust the mean of the probability distribution of HDD for
Energy and Commodity Derivatives
809

temperature trends. Suppose that a linear regression shows that the cumulative
HDD for February is decreasing at the rate of 0.5 per year (perhaps because of
global warming), so that the estimate of the mean HDD in February 2016 is
only 697.7 Keeping the estimate of the standard deviation of the natural logarithm
of the payoﬀthe same, this would reduce the value of the expected payoﬀto
$180,400 and the value of the option to $175,100.
Finally, suppose that long-range weather forecasters consider it likely that
February 2013 will be particularly mild. The estimate of the expected HDD might
then be reduced even further making the option even less valuable.
In the insurance area, Litzenberger et al. have shown that there is (as one would expect)
no statistically signiﬁcant correlation between the returns from CAT bonds and stock
market returns.8 This conﬁrms that there is no systematic risk and that valuations can
be based on the actuarial data collected by insurance companies.
CAT bonds typically give a high probability of an above-normal rate of interest and a
low probability of a big loss. Why would investors be interested in such instruments?
The answer is that the expected return (taking account of possible losses) is higher than
the return that can be earned on risk-free investments. However, the risk in CAT bonds
can (at least in theory) be completely diversiﬁed away in a large portfolio. CAT bonds
therefore have the potential to improve risk–return trade-oﬀs.
34.8
HOW AN ENERGY PRODUCER CAN HEDGE RISKS
There are two components to the risks facing an energy producer. One is the risk
associated with the market price for the energy (the price risk); the other is risk
associated with the amount of energy that will be bought (the volume risk). Although
prices do adjust to reﬂect volumes, there is a less-than-perfect relationship between the
two, and energy producers have to take both into account when developing a hedging
strategy. The price risk can be hedged using the energy derivative contracts. The volume
risks can be hedged using the weather derivatives. Deﬁne:
Y : Proﬁt for a month
P: Average energy prices for the month
T : Relevant temperature variable (HDD or CDD) for the month.
An energy producer can use historical data to obtain a best-ﬁt linear regression
relationship of the form
Y ¼ a þ bP þ cT þ 
where  is the error term. The energy producer can then hedge risks for the month by
taking a position of b in energy forwards or futures and a position of c in weather
forwards or futures. The relationship can also be used to analyze the eﬀectiveness of
alternative option strategies.
7 The mean decreased at 0.5 per year over the last 50 years and was 710 on average. This suggests that the
mean was about 722.5 at the beginning of the 50 years and 697.5 at the end of the 50 years. A reasonable
estimate for next year is 697.

CHAPTER 34

SUMMARY
When there are risks to be managed, derivatives markets have been very innovative in
developing products to meet the needs of the market.
There are a number of diﬀerent types of commodity derivatives. The underlyings
include agricultural products that are grown, livestock, metals, and energy products.
The models used to value them usually incorporate mean reversion. Sometimes
seasonality is modeled explicitly and jumps are incorporated. Energy derivatives with
oil, natural gas, and electricity as the underlying are particularly important and have
been the subject of models that are as sophisticated as the most sophisticated models
used for stock prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
In the weather derivatives market, two measures, HDD and CDD, have been
developed to describe temperature during a month. These are used to deﬁne payoﬀs
on both exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives. As the weather derivatives
market develops, contracts on rainfall, snow, and other weather-related variables may
become more widely used.
Insurance derivatives are an alternative to traditional reinsurance as a way for
insurance companies to manage the risk of a catastrophic event such as a hurricane
or an earthquake. We may see other sorts of insurance, such as life and automobile
insurance, being traded in a similar way in the future.
Weather and insurance derivatives have the property that the underlying variables
have no systematic risk. This means that the derivatives can be valued by estimating
expected payoﬀs using historical data and discounting the expected payoﬀat the risk-
free rate.

Real Options
Up to now we have been almost entirely concerned with the valuation of ﬁnancial
assets. In this chapter we explore how the ideas we have developed can be extended to
assess capital investment opportunities in real assets such as land, buildings, plant, and
equipment. Often there are options embedded in these investment opportunities (the
option to expand the investment, the option to abandon the investment, the option to
defer the investment, and so on.) These options are very diﬃcult to value using
traditional capital investment appraisal techniques. The approach known as real options
attempts to deal with this problem using option pricing theory.
The chapter starts by explaining the traditional approach to evaluating investments in
real assets and shows how diﬃcult it is to correctly value embedded options when this
approach is used. It then explains how the risk-neutral valuation approach can be
extended to handle the valuation of real assets and presents a number of examples
illustrating the application of the approach in diﬀerent situations.
35.1
CAPITAL INVESTMENT APPRAISAL
The traditional approach to valuing a potential capital investment project is the ‘‘net
present value’’ (NPV) approach. The NPV of a project is the present value of its
expected future incremental cash ﬂows. The discount rate used to calculate the present
value is a ‘‘risk-adjusted’’ discount rate, chosen to reﬂect the risk of the project. As the
riskiness of the project increases, the discount rate also increases.
As an example, consider an investment that costs $100 million and will last 5 years.
The expected cash inﬂow in each year (in the real world) is estimated to be $25 million.
If the risk-adjusted discount rate is 12% (with continuous compounding), the net
present value of the investment is (in millions of dollars)
100 þ 25e0:121 þ 25e0:122 þ 25e0:123 þ 25e0:124 þ 25e0:125 ¼ 11:53
A negative NPV, such as the one we have just calculated, indicates that the project will
reduce the value of the company to its shareholders and should not be undertaken.
A positive NPV would indicate that the project should be undertaken because it will
increase shareholder wealth.
814
35
C H A P T E R

The risk-adjusted discount rate should be the return required by the company, or the
company’s shareholders, on the investment. This can be calculated in a number of ways.
One approach often recommended involves the capital asset pricing model (see the
appendix to Chapter 3). The steps are as follows:
1. Take a sample of companies whose main line of business is the same as that of the
project being contemplated.
2. Calculate the betas of the companies and average them to obtain a proxy beta for
the project.
3. Set the required rate of return equal to the risk-free rate plus the proxy beta times
the excess return of the market portfolio over the risk-free rate.
One problem with the traditional NPV approach is that many projects contain
embedded options. Consider, for example, a company that is considering building a
plant to manufacture a new product. Often the company has the option to abandon the
project if things do not work out well. It may also have the option to expand the plant if
demand for the output exceeds expectations. These options usually have quite diﬀerent
risk characteristics from the base project and require diﬀerent discount rates.
To understand the problem here, return to the example at the beginning of Chapter 13.
This involved a stock whose current price is $20. In three months the price will be either
$22 or $18. Risk-neutral valuation shows that the value of a three-month call option on
the stock with a strike price of 21 is 0.633. Footnote 1 of Chapter 13 shows that if the
expected return required by investors on the stock in the real world is 16% then the
expected return required on the call option is 42.6%. A similar analysis shows that if the
option is a put rather than a call the expected return required on the option is 52:5%.
These analyses mean that if the traditional NPV approach were used to value the call
option the correct discount rate would be 42.6%, and if it were used to value a put option
the correct discount rate would be 52:5%. There is no easy way of estimating these
discount rates. (We know them only because we are able to value the options another
way.) Similarly, there is no easy way of estimating the risk-adjusted discount rates
appropriate for cash ﬂows when they arise from abandonment, expansion, and other
options. This is the motivation for exploring whether the risk-neutral valuation principle
can be applied to options on real assets as well as to options on ﬁnancial assets.
Another problem with the traditional NPV approach lies in the estimation of the
appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for the base project (i.e., the project without
embedded options). The companies that are used to estimate a proxy beta for the
project in the three-step procedure above have expansion options and abandonment
options of their own. Their betas reﬂect these options and may not therefore be
appropriate for estimating a beta for the base project.
35.2
EXTENSION OF THE RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION FRAMEWORK
In Section 28.1 the market price of risk for a variable  was deﬁned as
 ¼   r

ð35:1Þ
where r is the risk-free rate,  is the return on a traded security dependent only on ,
Real Options
815

and  is its volatility. As shown in Section 28.1, the market price of risk, , does not
depend on the particular traded security chosen.
Suppose that a real asset depends on several variables i (i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ). Let mi and si
be the expected growth rate and volatility of i so that
di=i ¼ mi dt þ si dzi
where zi is a Wiener process. Deﬁne i as the market price of risk of i. Risk-neutral
valuation can be extended to show that any asset dependent on the i can be valued by1
1. Reducing the expected growth rate of each i from mi to mi  isi
2. Discounting cash ﬂows at the risk-free rate.
Example 35.1
The cost of renting commercial real estate in a certain city is quoted as the
amount that would be paid per square foot per year in a new 5-year rental
agreement. The current cost is $30 per square foot. The expected growth rate
of the cost is 12% per annum, the volatility of the cost is 20% per annum, and its
market price of risk is 0.3. A company has the opportunity to pay $1 million now
for the option to rent 100,000 square feet at $35 per square foot for a 5-year
period starting in 2 years. The risk-free rate is 5% per annum (assumed constant).
Deﬁne V as the quoted cost per square foot of oﬃce space in 2 years. Assume that
rent is paid annually in advance. The payoﬀfrom the option is
100,000A maxðV  35; 0Þ
where A is an annuity factor given by
A ¼ 1 þ 1  e0:051 þ 1  e0:052 þ 1  e0:053 þ 1  e0:054 ¼ 4:5355
The expected payoﬀin a risk-neutral world is therefore
100,000  4:5355  ^E½maxðV  35; 0Þ ¼ 453,550  ^E½maxðV  35; 0Þ
where ^E denotes expectations in a risk-neutral world. Using the result in equa-
tion (15A.1), this is
453,550½ ^EðVÞNðd1Þ  35Nðd2Þ

The expected growth rate in the cost of commercial real estate in a risk-neutral
world is m  s, where m is the real-world growth rate, s is the volatility, and  is
the market price of risk. In this case, m ¼ 0:12, s ¼ 0:2, and  ¼ 0:3, so that the
expected risk-neutral growth rate is 0.06, or 6%, per year. It follows that
^EðVÞ ¼ 30e0:062 ¼ 33:82. Substituting this in the expression above gives the
expected payoﬀin a risk-neutral world as $1.5015 million. Discounting at the

of a non-dividend-paying stock. Since this is the price of a traded security, equation (35.1) implies that
ðmi  rÞ=si ¼ i, or mi  isi ¼ r. The expected growth-rate adjustment is therefore the same as setting the
return on the stock equal to the risk-free rate. For a proof of the more general result, see Technical Note 20

shows that it is worth paying $1 million for the option.
35.3
ESTIMATING THE MARKET PRICE OF RISK
The real-options approach to evaluating an investment avoids the need to estimate risk-
adjusted discount rates in the way described in Section 35.1, but it does require market
price of risk parameters for all stochastic variables. When historical data are available
for a particular variable, its market price of risk can be estimated using the capital asset
pricing model. To show how this is done, we consider an investment asset dependent
solely on the variable and deﬁne:
: Expected return of the investment asset
: Volatility of the return of the investment asset
: Market price of risk of the variable
: Instantaneous correlation between the percentage changes in the variable and
returns on a broad index of stock market prices
m: Expected return on broad index of stock market prices
m: Volatility of return on the broad index of stock market prices
r: Short-term risk-free rate
Because the investment asset is dependent solely on the market variable, the instant-
aneous correlation between its return and the broad index of stock market prices is
also . From a continuous-time version of the capital asset pricing model, which is
presented in the appendix to Chapter 3,2
  r ¼ 
m
ðm  rÞ
From equation (35.1), another expression for   r is
  r ¼ 
It follows that
 ¼ 
m
ðm  rÞ
ð35:2Þ
This equation can be used to estimate .
Example 35.2
A historical analysis of company’s sales, quarter by quarter, show that percentage
changes in sales have a correlation of 0.3 with returns on the S&P 500 index. The
volatility of the S&P 500 is 20% per annum and based on historical data the
expected excess return of the S&P 500 over the risk-free rate is 5%. Equation (35.2)
estimates the market price of risk for the company’s sales as
0:3
0:2  0:05 ¼ 0:075
2 When the excess return on the asset is regressed against the excess on the market index, the slope of the
regression, beta, is =m.
Real Options
817

When no historical data are available for the particular variable under consideration,
other similar variables can sometimes be used as proxies. For example, if a plant is
being constructed to manufacture a new product, data can be collected on the sales of
other similar products. The correlation of the new product with the market index can
then be assumed to be the same as that of these other products. In some cases, the
estimate of  in equation (35.2) must be based on subjective judgment. If an analyst is
convinced that a particular variable is unrelated to the performance of a market index,
its market price of risk should be set to zero.
For some variables, it is not necessary to estimate the market price of risk because
the process followed by a variable in a risk-neutral world can be estimated directly. For
example, if the variable is the price of an investment asset, its total return in a risk-
neutral world is the risk-free rate. If the variable is the short-term interest rate r,
Chapter 31 shows how a risk-neutral process can be estimated from the initial term
structure of interest rates.
For commodities, futures prices can be used to estimate the risk-neutral process, as
discussed in Chapter 34. Example 34.2 provides a simple application of the real options
approach by using futures prices to evaluate an investment involving the breeding of
cattle.
35.4
APPLICATION TO THE VALUATION OF A BUSINESS
Traditional methods of business valuation, such as applying a price/earnings multiplier
to current earnings, do not work well for new businesses. Typically a company’s
earnings are negative during its early years as it attempts to gain market share and
establish relationships with customers. The company must be valued by estimating
future earnings and cash ﬂows under diﬀerent scenarios.
The real options approach can be useful in this situation. A model relating the
company’s future cash ﬂows to variables such as the sales growth rates, variable costs as
a percent of sales, ﬁxed costs, and so on, is developed. For key variables, a risk-neutral
stochastic process is estimated as outlined in the previous two sections. A Monte Carlo
simulation is then carried out to generate alternative scenarios for the net cash ﬂows per
year in a risk-neutral world. It is likely that under some of these scenarios the company
does very well and under others it becomes bankrupt and ceases operations. (The
simulation must have a built in rule for determining when bankruptcy happens.) The
value of the company is the present value of the expected cash ﬂow in each year using
the risk-free rate for discounting. Business Snapshot 35.1 gives an example of the
application of the approach to Amazon.com.
35.5
EVALUATING OPTIONS IN AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
As already mentioned, most investment projects involve options. These options can add
considerable value to the project and are often either ignored or valued incorrectly.
Examples of the options embedded in projects are:
1. Abandonment options. This is an option to sell or close down a project. It is an
American put option on the project’s value. The strike price of the option is the
818
CHAPTER 35

liquidation (or resale) value of the project less any closing-down costs. When the
liquidation value is low, the strike price can be negative. Abandonment options
mitigate the impact of very poor investment outcomes and increase the initial
valuation of a project.
2. Expansion options. This is the option to make further investments and increase the
output if conditions are favorable. It is an American call option on the value of
additional capacity. The strike price of the call option is the cost of creating this
additional capacity discounted to the time of option exercise. The strike price often
depends on the initial investment. If management initially choose to build capacity
in excess of the expected level of output, the strike price can be relatively small.
Business Snapshot 35.1
Valuing Amazon.com
One of the earliest published attempts to value a company using the real options
approach was Schwartz and Moon (2000), who considered Amazon.com at the end
of 1999. They assumed the following stochastic processes for the company’s sales
revenue R and its revenue growth rate :
dR
R ¼  dt þ ðtÞ dz1
d ¼ ð   Þ dt þ ðtÞ dz2
They assumed that the two Wiener processes dz1 and dz2 were uncorrelated and made
reasonable assumptions about ðtÞ, ðtÞ, , and  based on available data.
They assumed the cost of goods sold would be 75% of sales, other variable
expenses would be 19% of sales, and ﬁxed expenses would be $75 million per
quarter. The initial sales level was $356 million, the initial tax loss carry forward
was $559 million, and the tax rate was assumed to be 35%. The market price of risk
for R was estimated from historical data using the approach described in the previous
section. The market price of risk for  was assumed to be zero.
The time horizon for the analysis was 25 years and the terminal value of the
company was assumed to be ten times pretax operating proﬁt. The initial cash
position was $906 million and the company was assumed to go bankrupt if the cash
balance became negative.
Diﬀerent future scenarios were generated in a risk-neutral world using Monte Carlo
simulation. The evaluation of the scenarios involved taking account of the possible
exercise of convertible bonds and the possible exercise of employee stock options. The
value of the company to the share holders was calculated as the present value of the net
cash ﬂows discounted at the risk-free rate.
Using these assumptions, Schwartz and Moon provided an estimate of the value
of Amazon. com’s shares at the end of 1999 equal to $12.42. The market price at the
time was $76.125 (although it declined sharply in 2000). One of the key advantages
of the real-options approach is that it identiﬁes the key assumptions. Schwartz and
Moon found that the estimated share value was very sensitive to ðtÞ, the volatility of
the growth rate. This was an important source of optionality. A small increase
in ðtÞ leads to more optionality and a big increase in the value of Amazon.com
shares.

3. Contraction options. This is the option to reduce the scale of a project’s operation.
It is an American put option on the value of the lost capacity. The strike price is
the present value of the future expenditures saved as seen at the time of exercise of
the option.
4. Options to defer. One of the most important options open to a manager is the
option to defer a project. This is an American call option on the value of the
project.
5. Options to extend life. Sometimes it is possible to extend the life of an asset by
paying a ﬁxed amount. This is a European call option on the asset’s future value.
Illustration
As an example of the evaluation of an investment with embedded options, consider a
company that has to decide whether to invest $15 million to extract 6 million units of a
commodity from a certain source at the rate of 2 million units per year for 3 years. The
ﬁxed costs of operating the equipment are $6 million per year and the variable costs are
$17 per unit of the commodity extracted. We assume that the risk-free interest rate is
10% per annum for all maturities, that the spot price of the commodity is $20, and that
the 1-, 2-, and 3-year futures prices are $22, $23, and $24, respectively.
Evaluation with No Embedded Options
First consider the case where the project has no embedded options. The expected prices
of the commodity in 1, 2, and 3 years’ time in a risk-neutral world are $22, $23, and $24,
respectively. The expected payoﬀfrom the project (in millions of dollars) in a risk-neutral
world can be calculated from the cost data as 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 in years 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. The value of the project is therefore
15:0 þ 4:0e0:11 þ 6:0e0:12 þ 8:0e0:13 ¼ 0:54
This analysis indicates that the project should not be undertaken because it would
reduce shareholder wealth by 0.54 million.
Use of a Tree
We now assume that the spot price of the commodity follows the process
d ln S ¼ ½ðtÞ  a ln S dt þ  dz
ð35:3Þ
where a ¼ 0:1 and  ¼ 0:2. In Section 34.4, we showed how a tree can be constructed
for commodity prices using the same example as the one considered here. The tree is
shown in Figure 35.1 (which is the same as Figure 34.2). The process represented by the
tree is consistent with the process assumed for S, the assumed values of a and , and the
assumed 1-, 2-, and 3-year futures prices.
We do not need to use a tree to value the project when there are no embedded
options. (We have already shown that the base value of the project without options is
0:54.) However, before we move on to consider options, it will be instructive, as well
as useful for future calculations, for us to use the tree to value the project in the absence
of embedded options and verify that we get the same answer as that obtained earlier.
820
CHAPTER 35

Figure 35.2 shows the value of the project at each node of Figure 35.1. Consider, for
example, node H. There is a 0.2217 probability that the commodity price at the end of
the third year is 22.85, so that the third-year proﬁt is 2  22:85  2  17  6 ¼ 5:70.
Similarly, there is a 0.6566 probability that the commodity price at the end of the third
year is 16.16, so that the proﬁt is 7:68 and there is a 0.1217 probability that the
commodity price at the end of the third year is 11.43, so that the proﬁt is 17:14. The
value of the project at node H in Figure 35.2 is therefore
½0:2217  5:70 þ 0:6566  ð7:68Þ þ 0:1217  ð17:14Þe0:11 ¼ 5:31
As another example, consider node C. There is a 0.1667 chance of moving to node F
where the commodity price is 31.37. The second year cash ﬂow is then
2  31:37  2  17  6 ¼ 22:74
The value of subsequent cash ﬂows at node F is 21.42. The total value of the project if
we move to node F is therefore 21:42 þ 22:74 ¼ 44:16. Similarly the total value of the
project if we move to nodes G and H are 10.35 and 13:93, respectively. The value of
the project at node C is therefore
½0:1667  44:16 þ 0:6666  10:35 þ 0:1667  ð13:93Þe0:11 ¼ 10:80
Figure 35.2 shows that the value of the project at the initial node A is 14.46. When the
initial investment is taken into account the value of the project is therefore 0:54. This
is in agreement with our earlier calculations.

Option to Abandon
Suppose now that the company has the option to abandon the project at any time. We
suppose that there is no salvage value and no further payments are required once the
project has been abandoned. Abandonment is an American put option with a strike
price of zero and is valued in Figure 35.3. The put option should not be exercised at
nodes E, F, and G because the value of the project is positive at these nodes. It should
be exercised at nodes H and I. The value of the put option is 5.31 and 13.49 at nodes H
and I, respectively. Rolling back through the tree, the value of the abandonment put
option at node D if it is not exercised is
ð0:1217  13:49 þ 0:6566  5:31 þ 0:2217  0Þe0:11 ¼ 4:64
The value of exercising the put option at node D is 9.65. This is greater than 4.64, and
so the put should be exercised at node D. The value of the put option at node C is
½0:1667  0 þ 0:6666  0 þ 0:1667  ð5:31Þe0:11 ¼ 0:80
and the value at node A is
ð0:1667  0 þ 0:6666  0:80 þ 0:1667  9:65Þe0:11 ¼ 1:94
The abandonment option is therefore worth $1.94 million. It increases the value of the
project from $0:54 million to þ$1:40 million. A project that was previously unattractive
now has a positive value to shareholders.

CHAPTER 35

Option to Expand
Suppose next that the company has no abandonment option. Instead it has the option at
any time to increase the scale of the project by 20%. The cost of doing this is $2 million.
Production increases from 2.0 to 2.4 million units per year. Variable costs remain $17 per
unit and ﬁxed costs increase by 20% from $6.0 million to $7.2 million. This is an
American call option to buy 20% of the base project in Figure 35.2 for $2 million.
The option is valued in Figure 35.4. At node E, the option should be exercised. The
payoﬀis 0:2  42:24  2 ¼ 6:45. At node F, it should also be exercised for a payoﬀof
0:2  21:42  2 ¼ 2:28. At nodes G, H, and I, the option should not be exercised. At
node B, exercising is worth more than waiting and the option is worth 0:2  38:32  2 ¼
5:66. At node C, if the option is not exercised, it is worth
ð0:1667  2:28 þ 0:6666  0:00 þ 0:1667  0:00Þe0:11 ¼ 0:34
If the option is exercised, it is worth 0:2  10:80  2 ¼ 0:16. The option should there-
fore not be exercised at node C. At node A, if not exercised, the option is worth
ð0:1667  5:66 þ 0:6666  0:34 þ 0:1667  0:00Þe0:11 ¼ 1:06
If the option is exercised it is worth 0:2  14:46  2 ¼ 0:89. Early exercise is therefore
not optimal at node A. In this case, the option increases the value of the project from
0:54 to þ0:52. Again we ﬁnd that a project that previously had a negative value now
has a positive value.

Real Options
823

The expansion option in Figure 35.4 is relatively easy to value because, once the
option has been exercised, all subsequent cash inﬂows and outﬂows increase by 20%. In
the case where ﬁxed costs remain the same or increase by less than 20%, it is necessary
to keep track of more information at the nodes of Figure 35.4. Speciﬁcally, we need to
record the following in order to calculate the payoﬀfrom exercising the option:
1. The present value of subsequent ﬁxed costs
2. The present value of subsequent revenues net of variable costs.
Multiple Options
When a project has two or more options, they are typically not independent. The value of
having both option A and option B, for example, is generally not the sum of the values of
the two options. To illustrate this, suppose that the company we have been considering
has both abandonment and expansion options. The project cannot be expanded if it has
already been abandoned. Moreover, the value of the put option to abandon depends on
whether the project has been expanded.3
These interactions between the options in our example can be handled by deﬁning
four states at each node:
1. Not already abandoned; not already expanded
2. Not already abandoned; already expanded

CHAPTER 35

3. Already abandoned; not already expanded
4. Already abandoned; already expanded.
When we roll back through the tree we calculate the combined value of the options at
each node for all four alternatives. This approach to valuing path-dependent options is
discussed in more detail in Section 27.5.
Several Stochastic Variables
When there are several stochastic variables, the value of the base project is usually
determined by Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation of the project’s embedded
options is then more diﬃcult because a Monte Carlo simulation works from the
beginning to the end of a project. When we reach a certain point, we do not have
information on the present value of the project’s future cash ﬂows. However, the
techniques mentioned in Section 27.8 for valuing American options using Monte Carlo
simulation can sometimes be used.
As an illustration of this point, Schwartz and Moon (2000) explain how their
Amazon.com analysis outlined in Business Snapshot 35.1 could be extended to take
account of the option to abandon (i.e. the option to declare bankruptcy) when the value
of future cash ﬂows is negative.4 At each time step, a polynomial relationship between the
value of not abandoning and variables such as the current revenue, revenue growth rate,
volatilities, cash balances, and loss carry forwards is assumed. Each simulation trial
provides an observation for obtaining a least-squares estimate of the relationship at each
time. This is the Longstaﬀand Schwartz approach of Section 27.8.5
SUMMARY
This chapter has investigated how the ideas developed earlier in the book can be
applied to the valuation of real assets and options on real assets. It has shown how
the risk-neutral valuation principle can be used to value a project dependent on any set
of variables. The expected growth rate of each variable is adjusted to reﬂect its market
price of risk. The value of the asset is then the present value of its expected cash ﬂows
discounted at the risk-free rate.
Risk-neutral valuation provides an internally consistent approach to capital invest-
ment appraisal. It also makes it possible to value the options that are embedded in
many of the projects that are encountered in practice. This chapter has illustrated the
approach by applying it to the valuation of Amazon.com at the end of 1999 and the
valuation of a project involving the extraction of a commodity.

Practice Questions (Answers in Solutions Manual)
35.1. Explain the diﬀerence between the net present value approach and the risk-neutral
valuation approach for valuing a new capital investment opportunity. What are the
advantages of the risk-neutral valuation approach for valuing real options?
35.2. The market price of risk for copper is 0.5, the volatility of copper prices is 20% per
annum, the spot price is 80 cents per pound, and the 6-month futures price is 75 cents per
pound. What is the expected percentage growth rate in copper prices over the next
6 months?
35.3. Show that if y is a commodity’s convenience yield and u is its storage cost, the
commodity’s growth rate in the traditional risk-neutral world is r  y þ u, where r is
the risk-free rate. Deduce the relationship between the market price of risk of the
commodity, its real-world growth rate, its volatility, y, and u.
35.4. The correlation between a company’s gross revenue and the market index is 0.2. The
excess return of the market over the risk-free rate is 6% and the volatility of the market
index is 18%. What is the market price of risk for the company’s revenue?
35.5. A company can buy an option for the delivery of 1 million units of a commodity in 3 years
at $25 per unit. The 3-year futures price is $24. The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum
with continuous compounding and the volatility of the futures price is 20% per annum.
How much is the option worth?
35.6. A driver entering into a car lease agreement can obtain the right to buy the car in 4 years
for $10,000. The current value of the car is $30,000. The value of the car, S, is expected to
follow the process dS ¼ S dt þ S dz, where  ¼ 0:25,  ¼ 0:15, and dz is a Wiener
process. The market price of risk for the car price is estimated to be 0:1. What is the
value of the option? Assume that the risk-free rate for all maturities is 6%.
Further Questions

Derivatives
Mishaps and What
We Can Learn
from Them
Since the mid-1980s there have been some spectacular losses in derivatives markets. The
biggest losses have come from the trading of products created from residential mort-
gages in the US and were discussed in Chapter 8. Some of the other losses made by
ﬁnancial institutions are listed in Business Snapshot 36.1, and some of those made by
nonﬁnancial organizations in Business Snapshot 36.2. What is remarkable about these
lists is the number of situations where huge losses arose from the activities of a single
employee. In 1995, Nick Leeson’s trading brought a 200-year-old British bank, Barings,
to its knees; in 1994, Robert Citron’s trading led to Orange County, a municipality in
California, losing about $2 billion. Joseph Jett’s trading for Kidder Peabody lost
$350 million. John Rusnak’s losses of $700 million for Allied Irish Bank came to light
in 2002. In 2006 the hedge fund Amaranth lost $6 billion because of trading risks taken
by Brian Hunter. In 2008, Je´ roˆ me Kerviel lost over $7 billion trading equity index
futures for Socie´ te´ Ge´ ne´ rale. The huge losses at UBS, Shell, and Sumitomo were also
each the result of the activities of a single individual.
The losses should not be viewed as an indictment of the whole derivatives industry.
The derivatives market is a vast multitrillion dollar market that by most measures has
been outstandingly successful and has served the needs of its users well. The events
listed in Business Snapshots 36.1 and 36.2 represent a tiny proportion of the total trades
(both in number and value). Nevertheless, it is worth considering carefully the lessons
that can be learned from them.
36.1
LESSONS FOR ALL USERS OF DERIVATIVES
First, we consider the lessons appropriate to all users of derivatives, whether they are
ﬁnancial or nonﬁnancial companies.

Business Snapshot 36.1
Big losses by ﬁnancial institutions
Allied Irish Bank
This bank lost about $700 million from speculative activities of one of its foreign
exchange traders, John Rusnak, that lasted a number of years. Rusnak managed to
cover up his losses by creating ﬁctitious option trades.
Amaranth
This hedge fund lost $6 billion in 2006 betting on the future direction of natural gas
prices.
Barings
This 200-year-old British bank was destroyed in 1995 by the activities of one trader,
Nick Leeson, in Singapore, who made big bets on the future direction of the Nikkei 225
using futures and options. The total loss was close to $1 billion.
Enron’s counterparties
Enron managed to conceal its true situation from its shareholders with some creative
contracts. Several ﬁnancial institutions that allegedly helped Enron do this have
settled shareholder lawsuits for over $1 billion.
Kidder Peabody (see page 131)
The activities of a single trader, Joseph Jett, led to this New York investment dealer
losing $350 million trading US government securities. The loss arose because of a
mistake in the way the company’s computer system calculated proﬁts.
Long-Term Capital Management (see page 56)
This hedge fund lost about $4 billion in 1998 as a result of Russia’s default on its debt
and the resultant ﬂight to quality. The New York Federal Reserve organized an
orderly liquidation of the fund by arranging for 14 banks to invest in the fund.
Midland Bank
This British bank lost $500 million in the early 1990s largely because of a wrong bet
on the direction of interest rates. It was later taken over by the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).
Socie´te´ Ge´ne´rale (see page 40)
Je´ roˆ me Kerviel lost over $7 billion speculating on the future direction of equity
indices in January 2008.
Subprime Mortgage Losses (see Chapter 8)
In 2007 investors lost conﬁdence in the structured products created from US
subprime mortgages. This led to a ‘‘credit crunch’’ and losses of tens of billions of
dollars by ﬁnancial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup.
UBS
In 2011, Kweku Adoboli lost $2.3 billion by taking unauthorized speculative positions
in stock market indices.

829

Deﬁne Risk Limits
It is essential that all companies deﬁne in a clear and unambiguous way limits to the
ﬁnancial risks that can be taken. They should then set up procedures for ensuring that
the limits are obeyed. Ideally, overall risk limits should be set at board level. These
should then be converted to limits applicable to the individuals responsible for
managing particular risks. Daily reports should indicate the gain or loss that will be
experienced for particular movements in market variables. These should be checked
against the actual gains and losses that are experienced to ensure that the valuation
procedures underlying the reports are accurate.
It is particularly important that companies monitor risks carefully when derivatives
are used. This is because, as we saw in Chapter 1, derivatives can be used for hedging,
Business Snapshot 36.2
Big losses by nonﬁnancial organizations
Allied Lyons
The treasury department of this drinks and food company lost $150 million in 1991
selling call options on the US dollar–sterling exchange rate.
Gibson Greetings
The treasury department of this greeting card manufacturer lost about $20 million in
1994 trading highly exotic interest rate derivatives contracts with Bankers Trust. It
later sued Bankers Trust and settled out of court.
Hammersmith and Fulham (see page 199)
This British Local Authority lost about $600 million on sterling interest rate swaps
and options in 1988. All its contracts were later declared null and void by the British
courts, much to the annoyance of the banks on the other side of the transactions.
Metallgesellschaft (see page 91)
This German company entered into long-term contracts to supply oil and gasoline
and hedged them by rolling over short-term futures contracts. It lost $1.3 billion
when it was forced to discontinue this activity.
Orange County (see page 111)
The activities of the treasurer, Robert Citron, led to this California municipality
losing about $2 billion in 1994. The treasurer was using derivatives to speculate that
interest rates would not rise.
Procter & Gamble (see page 794)
The treasury department of this large US company lost about $90 million in 1994
trading highly exotic interest rate derivatives contracts with Bankers Trust. It later
sued Bankers Trust and settled out of court.
Shell
A single employee working in the Japanese subsidiary of this company lost $1 billion
dollars in unauthorized trading of currency futures.
Sumitomo
A single trader working for this Japanese company lost about $2 billion in the copper
spot, futures, and options market in the 1990s.
830
CHAPTER 36

speculation, and arbitrage. Without close monitoring, it is impossible to know whether
a derivatives trader has switched from being a hedger to a speculator or switched from
being an arbitrageur to being a speculator. The Barings, Socie´ te´ Ge´ ne´ rale, and UBS
losses are classic examples of what can go wrong. In each case, the trader’s mandate was
to carry out low-risk arbitrage or hedging. Unknown to their supervisors, the traders
switched from being arbitrageurs or hedgers to taking huge bets on the future direction
of market variables. Systems at their banks were so inadequate that nobody knew the
full extent of what they were doing.
The argument here is not that no risks should be taken. A trader in a ﬁnancial
institution or a fund manager should be allowed to take positions on the future
direction of relevant market variables. But the sizes of the positions that can be taken
should be limited and the systems in place should accurately report the risks being
taken.
Take the Risk Limits Seriously
What happens if an individual exceeds risk limits and makes a proﬁt? This is a tricky
issue for senior management. It is tempting to ignore violations of risk limits when
proﬁts result. However, this is shortsighted. It leads to a culture where risk limits are
not taken seriously, and it paves the way for a disaster. In some of the situations listed
in Business Snapshots 36.1 and 36.2, the companies had become complacent about
the risks they were taking because they had taken similar risks in previous years and
made proﬁts.
A classic example here is Orange County. Robert Citron’s activities in 1991–93 had
been very proﬁtable for Orange County, and the municipality had come to rely on his
trading for additional funding. People chose to ignore the risks he was taking because
he had produced proﬁts. Unfortunately, the losses made in 1994 far exceeded the proﬁts
from previous years.
The penalties for exceeding risk limits should be just as great when proﬁts result as
when losses result. Otherwise, traders who make losses are liable to keep increasing
their bets in the hope that eventually a proﬁt will result and all will be forgiven.
Do Not Assume You Can Outguess the Market
Some traders are quite possibly better than others. But no trader gets it right all the
time. A trader who correctly predicts the direction in which market variables will move
60% of the time is doing well. If a trader has an outstanding track record (as Robert
Citron did in the early 1990s), it is likely to be a result of luck rather than superior
trading skill.
Suppose that a ﬁnancial institution employs 16 traders and one of those traders
makes proﬁts in every quarter of a year. Should the trader receive a good bonus?
Should the trader’s risk limits be increased? The answer to the ﬁrst question is that
inevitably the trader will receive a good bonus. The answer to the second question
should be no. The chance of making a proﬁt in four consecutive quarters from
random trading is 0:54 or 1 in 16. This means that just by chance one of the
16 traders will ‘‘get it right’’ every single quarter of the year. It should not be
assumed that the trader’s luck will continue and the trader’s risk limits should not
be increased.
Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them
831

Do Not Underestimate the Beneﬁts of Diversiﬁcation
When a trader appears good at predicting a particular market variable, there is a
tendency to increase the trader’s limits. We have just argued that this is a bad idea
because it is quite likely that the trader has been lucky rather than clever. However, let
us suppose that a fund is really convinced that the trader has special talents. How
undiversiﬁed should it allow itself to become in order to take advantage of the trader’s
special skills? The answer is that the beneﬁts from diversiﬁcation are huge, and it may
not be the best strategy to forego these beneﬁts to speculate heavily on just one market
variable.
An example will illustrate the point here. Suppose that there are 20 stocks, each of
which have an expected return of 10% per annum and a standard deviation of returns
of 30%. The correlation between the returns from any two of the stocks is 0.2. By
dividing an investment equally among the 20 stocks, an investor has an expected return
of 10% per annum and standard deviation of returns of 14.7%. Diversiﬁcation enables
the investor to reduce risks by over half. Another way of expressing this is that
diversiﬁcation enables an investor to double the expected return per unit of risk taken.
The investor would have to be very good at stock picking to consistently get a better risk–
return tradeoﬀby investing in just one stock.
Carry out Scenario Analyses and Stress Tests
The calculation of risk measures such as VaR should always be accompanied by
scenario analyses and stress testing to obtain an understanding of what can go wrong.
These were mentioned in Chapter 22. They are very important. Human beings have an
unfortunate tendency to anchor on one or two scenarios when evaluating decisions. In
1993 and 1994, for example, Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings may have been so
convinced that interest rates would remain low that they ignored the possibility of a
100-basis-point increase in their decision making.
It is important to be creative in the way scenarios are generated and to use the
judgment of experienced managers. One approach is to look at 10 or 20 years of data
and choose the most extreme events as scenarios. Sometimes there is a shortage of
data on a key variable. It is then sensible to choose a similar variable for which much
more data is available and use historical daily percentage changes in that variable as a
proxy for possible daily percentage changes in the key variable. For example, if there
is little data on the prices of bonds issued by a particular country, historical data on
prices of bonds issued by other similar countries can be used to develop possible
scenarios.
36.2
LESSONS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
We now move on to consider lessons that are primarily relevant to ﬁnancial institutions.
Monitor Traders Carefully
In trading rooms there is a tendency to regard high-performing traders as ‘‘untouch-
able’’ and to not subject their activities to the same scrutiny as other traders.
832
CHAPTER 36

Apparently Joseph Jett, Kidder Peabody’s star trader of Treasury instruments, was
often ‘‘too busy’’ to answer questions and discuss his positions with the company’s risk
managers.
All traders—particularly those making high proﬁts—should be fully accountable. It
is important for the ﬁnancial institution to know whether the high proﬁts are being
made by taking unreasonably high risks. It is also important to check that the ﬁnancial
institution’s computer systems and pricing models are correct and are not being
manipulated in some way.
Separate the Front, Middle, and Back Ofﬁce
The front oﬃce in a ﬁnancial institution consists of the traders who are executing trades,
taking positions, and so forth. The middle oﬃce consists of risk managers who are
monitoring the risks being taken. The back oﬃce is where the record keeping and
accounting takes place. Some of the worst derivatives disasters have occurred because
these functions were not kept separate. Nick Leeson controlled both the front and back
oﬃce for Barings in Singapore and was, as a result, able to conceal the disastrous
nature of his trades from his superiors in London for some time. Je´ roˆ me Kerviel had
worked in Socie´ te´ Ge´ ne´ rale’s back oﬃce before becoming a trader and took advantage
of his knowledge of its systems to hide his positions.
Do Not Blindly Trust Models
Some of the large losses incurred by ﬁnancial institutions arose because of the models
and computer systems being used. We discussed how Kidder Peabody was misled by
its own systems on page 131.
If large proﬁts are reported when relatively simple trading strategies are followed,
there is a good chance that the models underlying the calculation of the proﬁts are
wrong. Similarly, if a ﬁnancial institution appears to be particularly competitive on its
quotes for a particular type of deal, there is a good chance that it is using a diﬀerent
model from other market participants, and it should analyze what is going on carefully.
To the head of a trading room, getting too much business of a certain type can be just
as worrisome as getting too little business of that type.
Be Conservative in Recognizing Inception Proﬁts
When a ﬁnancial institution sells a highly exotic instrument to a nonﬁnancial corpora-
tion, the valuation can be highly dependent on the underlying model. For example,
instruments with long-dated embedded interest rate options can be highly dependent on
the interest rate model used. In these circumstances, a phrase used to describe the daily
marking to market of the deal is marking to model. This is because there are no market
prices for similar deals that can be used as a benchmark.
Suppose that a ﬁnancial institution manages to sell an instrument to a client for
$10 million more than it is worth—or at least $10 million more than its model says it is
worth. The $10 million is known as an inception proﬁt. When should it be recognized?
There appears to be quite a variation in what diﬀerent ﬁnancial institutions do. Some
recognize the $10 million immediately, whereas others are much more conservative and
recognize it slowly over the life of the deal.
Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them
833

Recognizing inception proﬁts immediately is very dangerous. It encourages traders to
use aggressive models, take their bonuses, and leave before the model and the value of
the deal come under close scrutiny. It is much better to recognize inception proﬁts
slowly, so that traders have the motivation to investigate the impact of several diﬀerent
models and several diﬀerent sets of assumptions before committing themselves to
a deal.
Do Not Sell Clients Inappropriate Products
It is tempting to sell corporate clients inappropriate products, particularly when they
appear to have an appetite for the underlying risks. But this is shortsighted. The most
dramatic example of this is the activities of Bankers Trust (BT) in the period leading up
to the spring of 1994. Many of BT’s clients were persuaded to buy high-risk and totally
inappropriate products. A typical product (e.g., the 5/30 swap discussed on page 794)
would give the client a good chance of saving a few basis points on its borrowings and a
small chance of costing a large amount of money. The products worked well for BT’s
clients in 1992 and 1993, but blew up in 1994 when interest rates rose sharply. The bad
publicity that followed hurt BT greatly. The years it had spent building up trust among
corporate clients and developing an enviable reputation for innovation in derivatives
were largely lost as a result of the activities of a few overly aggressive salesmen. BT was
forced to pay large amounts of money to its clients to settle lawsuits out of court. It was
taken over by Deutsche Bank in 1999.
Beware of Easy Proﬁts
Enron provides an example of how overly aggressive deal makers can cost the banks they
work for billions of dollars. Doing business with Enron seemed very proﬁtable and
banks competed with each other for this business. But the fact that many banks push
hard to get a certain type of business should not be taken as an indication that the
business will ultimately be proﬁtable. The business that Enron did with banks resulted in
shareholder lawsuits that were very expensive for the banks. In general, transactions
where high proﬁts seem easy to achieve should be looked at closely for hidden risks.
Investing in the AAA-rated tranches of the ABS CDOs that were created from
subprime mortgages (see Chapter 8) seemed like a fantastic opportunity. The promised
returns were much higher than the returns normally earned on AAA-rated instruments.
Many investors did not stop to ask whether the extra returns reﬂected risks not taken
into account by the rating agencies.
Do Not Ignore Liquidity Risk
Financial engineers usually base the pricing of exotic instruments and other instru-
ments that trade relatively infrequently on the prices of actively traded instruments. For
example:
1. A ﬁnancial engineer often calculates a zero curve from actively traded government
bonds (known as on-the-run bonds) and uses it to price government bonds that
trade less frequently (oﬀ-the-run bonds).
2. A ﬁnancial engineer often implies the volatility of an asset from actively traded
options and uses it to price less actively traded options.
834
CHAPTER 36

3. A ﬁnancial engineer often implies information about the behavior of interest rates
from actively traded interest rate caps and swap options and uses it to price
nonstandard interest rate derivatives that are less actively traded.
These practices are not unreasonable. However, it is dangerous to assume that less
actively traded instruments can always be traded at close to their theoretical price.
When ﬁnancial markets experience a shock of one sort or another there is often a
‘‘ﬂight to quality.’’ Liquidity becomes very important to investors, and illiquid instru-
ments often sell at a big discount to their theoretical values. This happened in 2007–9
following the jolt to credit markets caused by lack of conﬁdence in securities backed by
subprime mortgages.
Another example of losses arising from liquidity risk is provided by Long-Term
Capital Management (LTCM), which was discussed in Business Snapshot 2.2. This
hedge fund followed a strategy known as convergence arbitrage. It attempted to identify
two securities (or portfolios of securities) that should in theory sell for the same price. If
the market price of one security was less that of the other, it would buy that security
and sell the other. The strategy is based on the idea that if two securities have the same
theoretical price their market prices should eventually be the same.
In the summer of 1998 LTCM made a huge loss. This was largely because a default
by Russia on its debt caused a ﬂight to quality. LTCM tended to be long illiquid
instruments and short the corresponding liquid instruments (for example, it was long
oﬀ-the-run bonds and short on-the-run bonds). The spreads between the prices of
illiquid instruments and the corresponding liquid instruments widened sharply after
the Russian default. LTCM was highly leveraged. It experienced huge losses and there
were margin calls on its positions that it found diﬃcult to meet.
The LTCM story reinforces the importance of carrying out scenario analyses and
stress testing to look at what can happen in the worst of all worlds. LTCM could have
tried to examine other times in history when there had been extreme ﬂights to quality to
quantify the liquidity risks it was facing.
Beware When Everyone Is Following the Same
Trading Strategy
It sometimes happens that many market participants are following essentially the same
trading strategy. This creates a dangerous environment where there are liable to be big
market moves, unstable markets, and large losses for the market participants.
We gave one example of this in Chapter 19 when discussing portfolio insurance and
the market crash of October 1987. In the months leading up to the crash, increasing
numbers of portfolio managers were attempting to insure their portfolios by creating
synthetic put options. They bought stocks or stock index futures after a rise in the
market and sold them after a fall. This created an unstable market. A relatively small
decline in stock prices could lead to a wave of selling by portfolio insurers. The latter
would lead to a further decline in the market, which could give rise to another wave of
selling, and so on. There is little doubt that without portfolio insurance the crash of
October 1987 would have been much less severe.
Another example is provided by LTCM in 1998. Its position was made more diﬃcult
by the fact that many other hedge funds were following similar convergence arbitrage
strategies to its own. After the Russian default and the ﬂight to quality, LTCM tried to
Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them
835

liquidate part of its portfolio to meet margin calls. Unfortunately, other hedge funds
were facing similar problems to LTCM and trying to do similar trades. This exacerbated
the situation, causing liquidity spreads to be even higher than they would otherwise have
been and reinforcing the ﬂight to quality. Consider, for example, LTCM’s position in US
Treasury bonds. It was long the illiquid oﬀ-the-run bonds and short the liquid on-the-run
bonds. When a ﬂight to quality caused spreads between yields on the two types of bonds
to widen, LTCM had to liquidate its positions by selling oﬀ-the-run bonds and buying
on-the-run bonds. Other large hedge funds were doing the same. As a result, the price of
on-the-run bonds rose relative to oﬀ-the-run bonds and the spread between the two
yields widened even more than it had done already.
A further example is provided by the activities of British insurance companies in the
late 1990s. These insurance companies had entered into many contracts promising that
the rate of interest applicable to annuities would be the greater of the market rate and a
guaranteed rate. The insurance companies stood to lose money if long-term interest
rates fell below the guaranteed rate. For various reasons, they all entered into deriva-
tives transactions to partially hedge their risks at about the same time. The ﬁnancial
institutions on the other side of the derivatives transactions hedged their risks by buying
huge numbers of long-dated sterling bonds. As a result, bond prices rose and sterling
long-term interest rates declined. More bonds had to be bought to maintain the
dynamic hedge, sterling long-term interest rates declined further, and so on. The
ﬁnancial institutions lost money and insurance companies found themselves in a worse
position on the risks that they had chosen not to hedge.
The key lesson to be learned from these stories is that there can be big risks in
situations where many market participants are following the same trading strategy.
Do Not Make Excessive Use of Short-Term Funding for
Long-Term Needs
All ﬁnancial institutions ﬁnance long-term needs with short-term sources of funds to
some extent. But a ﬁnancial institution that relies too heavily on short-term funds is
likely to expose itself to unacceptable liquidity risks.
Suppose that a ﬁnancial institution funds long-term needs by rolling over commercial
paper every month. Commercial paper issued on April 1 would be redeemed with the
proceeds of a new commercial paper issue on May 1; this new commercial paper issue
would be redeemed with the proceeds of a commercial paper issue on June 1; and so on.
Provided that the ﬁnancial institution is perceived as healthy, there should be no
problem. But if investors lose conﬁdence in the ﬁnancial institution (rightly or wrongly),
it becomes impossible to roll over commercial paper and the ﬁnancial institution
experiences severe liquidity problems.
Many of the failures of ﬁnancial institutions during the credit crisis (e.g., Lehman
Brothers and Northern Rock) were largely caused by excessive reliance on short-term
funding. It is not surprising that the Basel Committee, which is responsible for
regulating banks internationally, is introducing liquidity ratios which banks must satisfy.
Market Transparency Is Important
One of the lessons from the credit crunch of 2007 is that market transparency is
important. During the period leading up to 2007, investors traded highly structured
836
CHAPTER 36

products without any real knowledge of the underlying assets. All they knew was the
credit rating of the security being traded. With hindsight, we can say that investors should
have demanded more information about the underlying assets and should have more
carefully assessed the risks they were taking—but it is easy to be wise after the event!
The subprime meltdown of August 2007 caused investors to lose conﬁdence in all
structured products and withdraw from that market. This led to a market breakdown
where tranches of structured products could only be sold at prices well below their
theoretical values. There was a ﬂight to quality and credit spreads increased. If there
had been market transparency so that investors understood the asset-backed securities
they were buying, there would still have been subprime losses, but the ﬂight to quality
and disruptions to the market would have been less pronounced.
Manage Incentives
A key lesson from the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 is the importance of incentives. The
bonus systems in banks tend to emphasize short-term performance. Some ﬁnancial
institutions have switched to systems where bonuses are based on performance over a
longer window than one year (for example, ﬁve years). This has obvious advantages. It
discourages traders from doing trades that will look good in the short run, but may
‘‘blow up’’ in a few years.
When loans are securitized, it is important to align the interests of the party
originating the loan with the party who bears the ultimate risk so that the originator
does not have an incentive to misrepresent the loan. One way of doing this is for
regulators to require the originator of a loan portfolio to keep a stake in all the tranches
and other instruments that are created from the portfolio.
Never Ignore Risk Management
When times are good (or appear to be good), there is a tendency to assume that nothing
can go wrong and ignore the output from stress tests and other analyses carried out by
the risk management group. There are many stories of risk managers not being listened
to in the period leading up to the credit crisis of 2007. The comment of Chuck Prince,
CEO of Citigroup, in July 2007 (just before the credit crisis) provides an example of
exactly the wrong attitude to risk management:
When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the
music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.
Mr. Prince lost his job later in the year and Citigroup’s losses from the credit crisis were
over $50 billion.
36.3
LESSONS FOR NONFINANCIAL CORPORATIONS
We now consider lessons primarily applicable to nonﬁnancial corporations.
Make Sure You Fully Understand the Trades You Are Doing
Corporations should never undertake a trade or a trading strategy that they do not
fully understand. This is a somewhat obvious point, but it is surprising how often a
Derivatives Mishaps and What We Can Learn from Them
837

trader working for a nonﬁnancial corporation will, after a big loss, admit to not
knowing what was really going on and claim to have been misled by investment
bankers. Robert Citron, the treasurer of Orange County did this. So did the traders
working for Hammersmith and Fulham, who in spite of their huge positions were
surprisingly uninformed about how the swaps and other interest rate derivatives they
traded really worked.
If a senior manager in a corporation does not understand a trade proposed by a
subordinate, the trade should not be approved. A simple rule of thumb is that if a trade
and the rationale for entering into it are so complicated that they cannot be understood
by the manager, it is almost certainly inappropriate for the corporation. The trades
undertaken by Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings would have been vetoed using
this criterion.
One way of ensuring that you fully understand a ﬁnancial instrument is to value it. If a
corporation does not have the in-house capability to value an instrument, it should not
trade it. In practice, corporations often rely on their derivatives dealers for valuation
advice. This is dangerous, as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings found out. When
they wanted to unwind their deals, they found they were facing prices produced by
Bankers Trust’s proprietary models, which they had no way of checking.
Make Sure a Hedger Does Not Become a Speculator
One of the unfortunate facts of life is that hedging is relatively dull, whereas speculation
is exciting. When a company hires a trader to manage the risks in exchange rates,
commodity prices, or interest rates, there is a danger that the following might happen.
At ﬁrst, the trader does the job diligently and earns the conﬁdence of top management.
The trader assesses the company’s exposures and hedges them. As time goes by, the
trader becomes convinced that he or she can outguess the market. Slowly the trader
becomes a speculator. At ﬁrst things go well, but then a loss is made. To recover the
loss, the trader doubles up the bets. Further losses are made—and so on. The result is
likely to be a disaster.
As mentioned earlier, clear limits to the risks that can be taken should be set by
senior management. Controls should be put in place to ensure that the limits are
obeyed. The trading strategy for a corporation should start with an analysis of the
risks facing the corporation in foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity markets, etc.
A decision should then be taken on how the risks are to be reduced to acceptable levels.
It is a clear sign that something is wrong within a corporation if the trading strategy is
not derived in a very direct way from the company’s exposures.
Be Cautious about Making the Treasury Department a
Proﬁt Center
In the last 20 years there has been a tendency to make the treasury department within a
corporation a proﬁt center. This appears to have much to recommend it. The treasurer is
motivated to reduce ﬁnancing costs and manage risks as proﬁtably as possible. The
problem is that the potential for the treasurer to make proﬁts is limited. When raising
funds and investing surplus cash, the treasurer is facing an eﬃcient market. The
treasurer can usually improve the bottom line only by taking additional risks. The
company’s hedging program gives the treasurer some scope for making shrewd decisions
838
CHAPTER 36

that increase proﬁts. But it should be remembered that the goal of a hedging program is
to reduce risks, not to increase expected proﬁts. As pointed out in Chapter 3, the
decision to hedge will lead to a worse outcome than the decision not to hedge roughly
50% of the time. The danger of making the treasury department a proﬁt center is that
the treasurer is motivated to become a speculator. This is liable to lead to the type of
outcome experienced by Orange County, Procter & Gamble, or Gibson Greetings.
SUMMARY
The huge losses experienced from the use of derivatives have made many treasurers very
wary. Following some of the losses, some nonﬁnancial corporations have announced
plans to reduce or even eliminate their use of derivatives. This is unfortunate because
derivatives provide treasurers with very eﬃcient ways to manage risks.
The stories behind the losses emphasize the point, made as early as Chapter 1, that
derivatives can be used for either hedging or speculation; that is, they can be used either
to reduce risks or to take risks. Most losses occurred because derivatives were used
inappropriately. Employees who had an implicit or explicit mandate to hedge their
company’s risks decided instead to speculate.
The key lesson to be learned from the losses is the importance of internal controls.
Senior management within a company should issue a clear and unambiguous policy
statement about how derivatives are to be used and the extent to which it is permissible
for employees to take positions on movements in market variables. Management should
then institute controls to ensure that the policy is carried out. It is a recipe for disaster
to give individuals authority to trade derivatives without a close monitoring of the risks
being taken.

DerivaGem Software
DerivaGem 3.00 incorporates a number of new features for readers of Options, Futures,
and Other Derivatives, 9th edition. European options can be valued using the CEV,
Merton mixed jump–diﬀusion, and variance-gamma models, which are discussed in
Chapter 27. Monte Carlo experiments can be run. LIBOR and OIS zero curves can be
calculated from market data. Swaps and bonds can be valued. When swaps, caps, and
swaptions are valued, either OIS or LIBOR discounting can be used.
Getting Started
The most diﬃcult part of using any software is getting started. Here is a step-by-step
guide to getting started with DerivaGem 3.00.
1. Use the access card that comes with this book to load DG300.xls, DG300
functions.xls, and DG300 applications.xls on to your computer. Open Excel ﬁle
DG300.xls.
2. You will need to make sure that macros are enabled. If Enable Editing and Enable
Macros appear at the top of the worksheet click on them. For some versions of
Windows and Oﬃce, you may need to make sure that security for macros is set at
medium or low.
3. Click on the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet at the bottom of the page.
4. Choose Currency as the Underlying Type and Binomial American as the Option
Type. Click on the Put button. Leave Imply Volatility unchecked.
5. You are now all set to value an American put option on a currency. There are
seven inputs: exchange rate, volatility, domestic risk-free rate, foreign risk-free rate
rate, time to expiration (years), exercise price, and time steps. Input these in cells
D5, D6, D7, D8, D13, D14, and D15 as 1.61, 12%, 8%, 9%, 1.0, 1.60, and 4,
respectively.
6. Hit Enter on your keyboard and click on Calculate. You will see the price of the
option in cell D20 as 0.07099 and the Greek letters in cells D21 to D25. The screen
you should have produced is shown on the following page.
7. Click on Display Tree. You will see the binomial tree used to calculate the option.
This is Figure 21.6 in Chapter 21.
862

Next Steps
You should now have no diﬃculty valuing other types of option on other underlyings
with this worksheet. To imply a volatility, check the Imply Volatility box and input the
option price in cell D20. Hit Enter and click on Calculate. The implied volatility is
displayed in cell D6.
Many diﬀerent charts can be displayed in the next worksheet. To display a chart, you
must ﬁrst choose the variable you require on the vertical axis, the variable you require
on the horizontal axis, and the range of values to be considered on the horizontal axis.
Following that, you should hit Enter on your keyboard and click on Draw Graph.
Other points to note about the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet are:
1. For European and American equity options, up to 7 dividends on the underlying
stock can be input in a table that pops up. Enter the time of each dividend
(measured in years from today) in the ﬁrst column and the amount of the
dividend in the second column.
2. Up to 500 time steps can be used for the valuation of American options, but only
a maximum of 10 time steps can be displayed.
3. Greek letters for all options other than standard calls and puts are calculated by
perturbing the inputs, not by using analytic formulas.
4. For an Asian option the Current Average is the average price since inception. For
a new deal (with zero time to inception), the current average is irrelevant.
DerivaGem Software
863

5. In the case of a lookback option, Minimum to Date is used when a call is valued
and Maximum to Date is used when a put is valued. For a new deal, these should
be set equal to the current price of the underlying asset.
6. Interest rates are continuously compounded with an Actual/Actual day count.
The Alternative Models worksheet operates like the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc
worksheet. Options can be valued using CEV, Merton mixed jump–diﬀusion model,
and the variance-gamma model. Charts are shown on the same worksheet. Implied
volatility can be chosen for the y-axis and strike price for the x-axis, so that volatility
smiles are displayed.
Monte Carlo Simulation
In the Monte Carlo worksheet, users can see how a number of diﬀerent types of options
are valued using the lognormal, Merton mixed jump–diﬀusion, and variance-gamma
models. Full results from ten simulation trials are displayed. When the Do AntiThetic
box is checked, these are averaged in pairs to produce ﬁve sample values. When it is not
checked, there are ten sample values. Standard errors from both the full simulation and
the ten displayed trials are shown.
Zero Curve
The LIBOR zero curve is calculated from LIBOR deposit rates and LIBOR-for-ﬁxed
swap rates. The OIS zero curve is calculated from OIS rates. For pedagogical reasons, a
simpliﬁed version of the real world is assumed where accrual periods are exact fractions
of a year (e.g., 1.0 years, 0.5 years, 0.25 year, etc.) and daycounts are Actual/Actual.
The LIBOR zero curve can be calculated with LIBOR discounting or with OIS
discounting, as described in Chapter 9. The worksheet can therefore be used to examine
the impact on the LIBOR zero curve of switching from LIBOR discounting to OIS
discounting.
Bonds and Swaps
The Bond_and_Swap_Price worksheet works similarly to earlier worksheets. Swaps can
be valued using either LIBOR or OIS discounting. For OIS discounting, it is necessary
to input an OIS zero curve as well as a LIBOR zero curve. The LIBOR zero curve will
usually be determined from the Zero Curve worksheet.
Bond Options
The general operation of the Bond_Options worksheet is similar to that of earlier
worksheets. The alternative models are Black’s model (see Section 29.1), the normal
model of the short rate (see equation (31.13)), and the lognormal model of the short
rate (see equation (31.18)). The ﬁrst model can be applied only to European options.
The other two can be applied to European or American options. The coupon is the rate
paid per year and the frequency of payments can be selected as Quarterly, Semi-Annual
or Annual. The zero-coupon yield curve is entered in the table labeled Term Structure.
Enter maturities (measured in years) in the ﬁrst column and the corresponding
continuously compounded rates in the second column. DerivaGem assumes a piecewise
864
DerivaGem Software

linear zero curve similar to that in Figure 4.1. The strike price can be quoted (clean) or
cash (dirty) (see Section 29.1). The quoted bond price, which is calculated by the
software, and the strike price, which is input, are per $100 of principal.
Caps and Swaptions
The general operation of the Caps_and Swap_Options worksheet is similar to that of
other worksheets. The worksheet is used to value interest rate caps/ﬂoors and swap
options. Black’s model for caps and ﬂoors is explained in Section 29.2 and Black’s
model for European swap options is explained in Section 29.3. The normal and
lognormal short-rate models are in equations (31.13) and (31.18), respectively. The
term structure of interest rates is entered in the same way as for bond options. The
frequency of payments can be selected as Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual, or
Annual. The software calculates payment dates by working backward from the end
of the life of the instrument. The initial accrual period for a cap/ﬂoor may be a
nonstandard length between 0.5 and 1.5 times a normal accrual period. Either LIBOR
discounting or OIS discounting can be used.
CDSs
The CDS worksheet is used to calculate hazard rates from CDS spreads and vice versa.
Users must input a term structure of interest rates (continuously compounded) and
either a term structure of CDS spreads or a term structure of hazard rates. The initial
hazard rate applies from time zero to the time speciﬁed; the second hazard rate applies
from the time corresponding to the ﬁrst hazard rate to the time corresponding to the
second hazard rate; and so on. The calculations are carried out assuming that default
can occur only at points midway between payment dates. This corresponds to the
calculations for the example in Section 25.2.
CDOs
The CDO worksheet calculates quotes for the tranches of CDOs from tranche correla-
tions input by the user. The attachment points and detachment points for tranches are
input by the user. The quotes can be in basis points or involve an upfront payment. In
the latter case, the spread in basis points is ﬁxed and the upfront payment, as a percent
of the tranche principal, is either input or implied. (For example, the ﬁxed spread for
the equity tranche of iTraxx Europe or CDX NA IG is 500 basis points.) The number
of integration points (see equation (25.12)) deﬁnes the accuracy of calculations and can
be left as 10 for most purposes (the maximum is 30). The software displays the expected
loss as a percent of the tranche principal (ExpLoss) and the present value of expected
payments (PVPmts) at the rate of 10,000 basis points per year. The spread and upfront
payment are
ExpLoss  10,000=PVPmts
and
ExpLoss  ðSpread  PVPmts=10,000Þ
respectively. The worksheet can be used to imply either tranche (compound) correla-
tions or base correlations from quotes input by the user. For base correlations to be
calculated, it is necessary for the ﬁrst attachment point to be 0% and the detachment
point for one tranche to be the attachment point for the next tranche.

How Greek Letters Are Deﬁned
In the Equity_FX_Index_Futures worksheet, the Greek letters are deﬁned as follows:
Delta: Change in option price per dollar increase in underlying asset
Gamma: Change in delta per dollar increase in underlying asset
Vega: Change in option price per 1% increase in volatility (e.g., volatility increases
from 20% to 21%)
Rho: Change in option price per 1% increase in interest rate (e.g., interest
increases from 5% to 6%)
Theta: Change in option price per calendar day passing.
For instruments dependent on interest rates, the Greek letters are deﬁned as follows:
DV01: Change in option price per 1-basis-point upward parallel shift in the zero
curve
Gamma: Change in DV01 for an upward parallel shift in the zero curve (Gamma is
per % per %)
Vega: Change in option price when volatility parameter increases by 1% (e.g.,
volatility increases from 20% to 21%).
The Applications Builder
Once you are familiar with the Options calculator (DG300.xls), you may want to start
using the Application Builder (DG300 applications.xls). You can also develop your own
applications with DG300 functions.xls. This contains the functions underlying Deriva-
Gem with VBA source code. The applications included with the software are:
A. Binomial Convergence. This investigates the convergence of the binomial model
in Chapters 13 and 21.
B. Greek Letters. This provides charts showing the Greek letters in Chapter 19.
C. Delta Hedge. This investigates the performance of delta hedging as in Tables 19.2
and 19.3.
D. Delta and Gamma Hedge. This investigates the performance of delta plus gamma
hedging for a position in a binary option.
E. Value and Risk. This calculates Value at Risk for a portfolio using three diﬀerent
approaches.
F. Barrier Replication. This carries out calculations for static options replication (see
Section 26.16).
G. Trinomial Convergence. This investigates the convergence of a trinomial tree
model.

There has been a great deal of consolidation of derivatives exchanges, nationally and inter-
nationally, in the last few years. The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange have merged to form the CME Group, which also includes the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX). Euronext and the NYSE have merged to form NYSE Euronext, which
now owns the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), the Paciﬁc Exchange (PXS), the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), and two French exchanges. The Australian
Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) have merged to form the Australian
Securities Exchange (ASX). The IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) has acquired the New York
Board of Trade (NYBOT), the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), and the Winnipeg
Commodity Exchange (WCE), and is merging with NYSE Euronext. Eurex, which is jointly
operated by Deutsche Borse AG and SIX Swiss Exchange, has acquired the International
Securities Exchange (ISE). No doubt the consolidation has been largely driven by economies
of scale that lead to lower trading costs.
