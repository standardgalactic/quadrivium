Dedication
I love teaching Web design because it’s so much fun to see what everyone creates. I dedicate
this book to everyone who aspires to share their ideas, stories, photos, business products and
services on the Internet, but is afraid it may be too hard to do themselves. You can do this:
You can create your own Web site, and in this book you’ll find everything you need to create,
design, publish, and promote your own Web site. I wish you all the best with your Web sites!


Author’s Acknowledgments
Over the years, I’ve thanked many people in my books — friends, teachers, mentors — but I
have been graced by so many wonderful people now that no publisher will give me all the
pages I’d need to thank them all. So let me start by thanking everyone I’ve ever known so I can
go to sleep tonight and know I haven’t forgotten anyone. 
More than anyone, I want to thank my husband, David LaFontaine, for his patience, love,
delightful sense of humor, and all his help in the research and production of this book. Your
intelligence and creativity inspire me and your love brings me more joy than I could have
imagined.
Thanks to all four of my fabulous parents, Malinda, Janice, Helen, and Robin for your love, sup-
port, and encouragement. Thanks to my brothers Brian and Kevin, and to Kevin’s delightful wife
Stephanie, and their amazing children Mikayla, Savannah, Jessica, and Calahan (you’ll find their
photos in the sample site in the Family Web sites chapter). Thanks also to all my extended
family, which now includes David’s large and wonderful collection of relatives, including Gail,
Dave, Linda, Mark, Beth, Sarah, and everyone else in the LaFontaine, Roos, and other clans.
Thanks to the entire editorial team at Wiley Publishing, especially my acquisitions editor Bob
Woerner, my development editor Becky Huehls, and everyone who helped to edit, produce,
and develop this book.
And finally, let me thank my lucky stars that this book is finally done. Complete. Finished.
That’s it. (And don’t even tell me those aren’t complete sentences.)

Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Introduction
I
f you’re feeling left out of the mad scramble to establish a presence on the
Internet, relax — you’re not alone. And it’s not too late.
Despite the hype, a few businesses still don’t have Web sites. And, even if you have
one, you’re probably still trying to figure out how to make your site better or more
profitable, or you’re already thinking that it’s time to redesign.
These days, it seems that every TV commercial, movie trailer, magazine insert, and
grocery store bulletin board warns that any serious business owner needs to have a
Web site, and most families, clubs, and even pet snakes do, too.
That’s increasingly true, but building a presence on the Internet isn’t something you
should do just because everyone else is doing it, and it isn’t all bad if you’ve waited
this long to make the Web a priority. Too many people have raced to put up Web
sites without fully considering how the Web fits in with their other goals and how
they can best take advantage of what the Web has to offer.
If you’ve waited until now, you may even be better off because the Internet has
matured, its audience has matured (it isn’t populated solely by teenagers and aca-
demics any more), and building a Web site has become easier than ever. If you’re
ready for a redesign of your first site, you have the advantage of being able to benefit
from your own and everyone else’s mistakes.
About This Book
This book is designed to help you progress through the entire process of creating a
site, from registering a domain name to creating a compelling design to attracting
just the right audience.
But you don’t have read this book from cover to cover, and you certainly don’t have
to memorize it. Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies was written to help you find the
answers you need when you need them. Consider this book a quick study guide and
a reference you can return to. Each section stands alone, giving you easy answers to
specific questions and step-by-step instructions for common tasks. If you want to
find out how to choose a hosting service, optimize images, or add video to your site,
just jump right in and go directly to the section that most interests you. And don’t
worry about spilling coffee on the pages if you bring the book to breakfast — I prom-
ise it won’t complain!
I designed this book using what I consider the best technologies for someone who
wants to create their own, custom Web site. If you picked up this book, I assume that
you’re not an advanced programmer and that you don’t want to hire a team of
expensive Web consultants — you want to do it yourself.

2
Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
To help you create the best site you can without your having to invest a million dol-
lars, or a million hours, I based the step-by-step tasks in each chapter on the tech-
nologies that I think offer all the features you need yet are relatively easy to figure
out with a little guidance. For images, you find instructions for using Photoshop
Elements, a popular and competitively priced image program that you can use to
create, edit, and optimize images so that they download quickly. For the pages of
your site, you find step-by-step instructions for Adobe Dreamweaver, as well as a
variety of templates you can use to create a Web site quickly. If you want to use
other programs or services, you find alternatives in handy sidebars near the rele-
vant step-by-step tasks.
About the Templates and 
Web Site for this Book
To help you get the most from this book, I created a special section at my Digital
Family Web site with files and templates you can download and use as you follow
along with the step-by-step tasks. You also find a FAQ (frequently asked questions),
links, additional resources, and updates. To get all these goodies, just enter the 
following address in your Web browser:
www.digitalfamily.com/diy
You need a password to get into this protected site, but if you have this book with
you when you log on, you have everything you need to gain access right away.
After you get into the Web site, you find instructions for downloading the templates,
which give you a head start in creating a full-fledged site of your own. You find tem-
plates designed to create an online profile or portfolio, a business site, or a family or
hobby site. And, you can customize the look and feel of these templates to use them
for any type of site with the image you want for your corner of the Web.
Throughout this book, you find references to the Web site and the templates and
other goodies that go with the step-by-step tasks. To make it easy to find the Web
address whenever you need it, I’ve included it in the Cheat Sheet in the front of this
book.
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, those con-
sistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions is in italics?
That’s a convention I use frequently. I put new terms in italics and then define them
so that you know what they mean.

Introduction
When I type URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses within regular paragraph
text, they look like this: www.jcwarner.com. Sometimes, however, I set off URLs on
their own lines, like this:
www.jcwarner.com
That’s so you can easily spot them on a page if you want to type them into your
browser to visit a site. I also assume that your Web browser doesn’t require the
introductory http:// for Web addresses. If you use an older browser, remember to
type this part before the address. (Also make sure to include that part of the address
when you’re creating links.)
Even though programs like Dreamweaver, which I recommend for creating Web sites,
makes knowing the HTML code unnecessary, you may want to wade into the HTML
waters occasionally. When I include HTML, such as the following code to link a URL
to a Web page, I set off the HTML in the same monofont type as I use for URLs:
<A HREF=”http://www.jcwarner.com”>Janine’s Web Site</A>
When I introduce you to a new set of features, such as options in a dialog box, I set
these items apart with bullets so that you can see that they’re all related. When 
I want you to follow instructions, I use numbered steps to walk you through the
process.
Foolish Assumptions
Although this book is designed to help you create a professional-looking Web site, 
I don’t assume that you’re a pro — at least not yet. In keeping with the philosophy
behind the For Dummies series, this easy-to-use guide is designed for readers with a
wide range of experience. Being interested in Web design and wanting to create a
Web site are the keys, but that desire to learn is all I expect from you.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the learning curve associated with any new program, I organ-
ized Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies to be a complete reference. This section
provides a breakdown of the four parts of the book and what you can find in 
each one.
Part I: Laying the Groundwork
Part I gets you started in creating a Web site and helps you lay a solid foundation for
your site. In Chapter 1, I walk you through the planning process, which can save you
a lot of time in the long run. In Chapter 2, you find out how to register a domain
name, and I give you tips for selecting the best hosting service. In Chapter 3, I intro-
duce you to the fundamentals of Web design.

4
Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
Part II: Putting the Pages Together
In Chapter 4, I move on to graphics, with an introduction to creating graphics for the
Web, an overview of the differences in formats (GIF, JPEG, and PNG files), and a
selection of tips for optimizing images so that they download quickly. In Chapter 5,
you find an introduction to Dreamweaver, and in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, you get step-
by-step instructions for personalizing the many templates that come with this book.
In Chapter 9, you discover the Dreamweaver testing and publishing features so that
you can publish your pages to the Internet as soon as you’re ready.
Part III: Going Web 2.0
In Part III, I go beyond basic Web design, by giving you instructions for creating a
blog in Chapter 10 and for recording and publishing a podcast in Chapter 11. In
Chapter 12, you find a review of the many audio, video, and animation formats and
instructions for how to add multimedia to your Web site. In Chapter 13, I “show you
the money” with instructions for including advertising and affiliates on your pages
as well as for adding e-commerce options to sell products and services.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Chapter 14 includes ten cool Web services that can help you add advanced features
to your site without having to know how to program. Finally, Chapter 15 features ten
ways to promote your site, because after you do all the work of creating an outstand-
ing Web site, you want to make sure to attract a good audience.

Part I
Laying the Groundwork


Chapter 1
Planning the Perfect Web Site
In This Chapter
 Pinpointing your Web site goals
 Understanding the benefits of developing a plan
 Stepping through a project plan
 Accommodating new ideas while sticking to your plan
I
f a potential partner approached you with a “great new business idea” guaran-
teed to make you money, you would probably ask a lot of questions before you
even considered writing a check to get things started. You would probably also
develop a business plan, or at least explore in detail how the new business would
work, how much it would cost you, and how much money you could expect to make
in return.
If you’re considering creating a Web site, or redesigning the one you already have, 
I recommend taking the same cautious approach. A good Web site is an extension of
your business and, in many cases, a new product, service, or storefront that
deserves the same level of planning as any other serious business venture.
This chapter is designed to help you carefully consider the many aspects of planning
a Web site before you start building. In the following pages, you’ll find a series of
questions to guide you through the early development process.
If you can complete the exercises in this chapter with a business partner or some-
one who provides a reality check, I recommend it. You know what they say about
decisions made in a vacuum: They generally suck. If you’re reading this book, you’re
probably sold on the idea of creating a Web site, and you even have some ideas
about what you want to do. Now go see whether you can sell it to someone else, and
take the time to do some careful planning before you dive in.
The planning process for a Web project should include these tasks:

Take time to determine your goals and objectives.

Organize all content you want to include on your site.

Set a realistic budget and schedule.
To get you started — and inspired — the first section of this chapter describes some
of the successful ways Web sites are being used personally and professionally.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Evaluating the Many Reasons 
to Create a Web Site
Before you start working on your own Web site, take a little time to explore what
other people have done on the Web. Oh, sure, you surfed the Web already, I’m sure
you did, but did you really study other Web sites? Did you analyze the way they’re
organized, study their front page features, and determine how their main navigation
and even subnavigation features work?
One of the best ways to prepare for developing your own Web site is to take some
time to explore related Web sites (and not-so-related sites) for ideas.
My goal in this book is to help you create not just a Web site but also one that truly
serves your goals, whether you want to launch a new business on the Internet, pro-
mote the business or organization you’re already working with, or stay in touch with
distant family members. Here are a few types of sites that people like you are suc-
cessfully using on the Internet:

Portfolio: Photographers, graphical designers, and artists use online portfo-
lios to showcase their creative work, provide online references, and attract
new clients. In Figure 1-1, photographer Jasper Johal showcases his photos
in an online gallery that makes it easy to view a collection of images all dis-
played on the same page: As you roll your cursor over the images on the
right, they’re displayed on the left. This type of navigation is a helpful way
to present a gallery.
Figure 1-1: Portfolio sites can showcase photos or artwork, like this gallery on Jasper Johal’s Web site.

Online profile: Consultants, authors, attorneys, dentists, and other profes-
sionals are well served by online profile sites that include biographical
information, a list of services or specialties, references and testimonials,
and links to completed projects, writings, or other works. To promote my
own books and my speaking and consulting services, I created an online
profile site at www.jcwarner.com, shown in Figure 1-2. You can also access
my site at www.JanineWarner.com. (In Chapter 2, you find tips about reg-
istering multiple domain names for the same Web site.)
Figure 1-2: You can find my full biography, writing samples, and more at my online profile site at
www.JCWarner.com.

Club or organization: Better than a bumper sticker, a Web site like the one
shown in Figure 1-3 is an excellent way to showcase your favorite clubs,
charities, after-school activities, hobbies, and more. 

Small business: Whether you’re a sole proprietor, like the dressmaker fea-
tured in Figure 1-4, or you have a rapidly growing, soon-to-be big business,
creating a Web site can make all the difference in your success, online 
and off.

participate in its unique sponsorship programs.

especially well suited to the Web where it’s easy to search for hard-to-find services.

Family and wedding: Before couples say “I do,” more and more of them are
building wedding Web sites that feature invitations, directions, guest reg-
istries, and more. And, as a family grows, building a Web site is a way to help
everyone stay in touch, which is the goal of the site shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5: Showcase your wedding photos, and keep your family members feeling connected with a per-
sonal Web site featuring those you love.
Developing a Project Plan
As with most project plans, a good Web site plan is made up of a series of tasks, a
budget, a timeline, and a list of the resources and materials you need. Taking the
time to create a detailed project plan gives you a structure within which you can
work with greater confidence, and a much better chance of meeting your original
goals on time and on budget.
The following list provides a step-by-step approach to creating a project plan:
1. Define the goals and objectives of your site.
2. Create a content list.
Building, testing, and publishing a Web Site
In a nutshell, building a Web site involves
creating a home page (often called the front
page ) that links to other pages representing
different sections of the site. Those pages, in
turn, can link to subsections that can then
lead to additional subsections or individual
pages. Once you’ve created a Web site, you
can test all the links on your own hard drive
and then upload the pages to a Web server
when everything is ready and working well.

12
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
3. Create a task list.
4. Set a timeline.
5. Establish a budget.
6. Determine how to handle maintenance and updates.
7. Assemble a team.
In the sections that follow, you find out the details involved in each of these steps.
Defining goals and objectives
The series of questions you find in this section is designed to help you assess how a
Web site can best serve you, your business, or organization. Taking the time to
answer each of the questions should help you define the goals of your site and
create a guide that you can use as you organize and prioritize the development.
Before you start sketching out the home page, it’s good practice to define the most
important aspects of a Web site and identify what you really need. Remember that
you can always start small and develop a Web site over time. There’s no rush to get
the site up as fast as possible — the Web isn’t going anywhere, and the best uses of
the Web are the ones that will be around for a long time.
Before you even start, make sure that you and your staff (or friends and family) are
clear about why you’re creating a Web site and what it will take. Spend a little time
answering each of the following questions, and use your responses to shape the
planning and implementation of your Web site. Creating an outstanding Web site
takes effort, and that effort can take time away from other things that are important.
The more you plan, the more you have time left over for a little fun and relaxation (at
least once in a while).

Why is having a Web site important to you?
Separate the pipe from the dream and get clear on your true motivation.

What are your objectives?
Determine whether you will use your Web site to promote your business,
sell products or services, cut costs, showcase clients, provide customer
support, stay in touch with friends and family, or do something that no one
else has ever done.
As you go through the planning and development process, write down your
top goals and refine them until you have two (at most, three) clear objec-
tives for your site. Then keep your list somewhere so that you’re forced to
look at your objectives regularly, like the edge of your computer monitor or
the bathroom mirror. Whenever you have a question about any aspect of
the design, content, or development of your site, refer to your list of goals
and make sure that your decisions remain true to your objectives.

How will you measure success?
You won’t achieve success with your Web site project unless you can effec-
tively measure its results, so be sure that you can voice your objectives in
measurable ways. The more specific and quantifiable you can be, the better.
For example, rather than just state, “The goal is reducing the telemarketing

13
Chapter 1: Planning the Perfect Web Site
staff,” assign an amount and a time frame to make an objective quantifiable,
such as, “The goal is reducing the telemarketing staff by 20 percent in 
6 months.” Doing so helps you make sure that you’re taking the necessary
steps to achieve that goal.

Whom do you want to visit your Web site?
Consider your audience above all else. If you’re creating a sales site for real
estate investors, you should probably take a different design approach 
than if you’re creating a game site for 12-year-olds. If you’re not sure what
12-year-olds want on a Web site, round some up and ask them.
Clarifying the target audience of your Web site should be a key factor in how
you plan and develop your site, from the vocabulary you use to how public
you make the information. For example, a site for doctors might include
complex medical terms, whereas a site for patients needs more common
language. Similarly, an architect might create a Web site with a public sec-
tion where potential clients can view photos of completed projects and tes-
timonials, and also create a password-protected section where current
clients can view plans as they’re being developed.

What do you want a user to gain from visiting your Web site?
One of my favorite benefits of a Web site is instant information at 1 a.m.
without having to talk to anybody or wait on hold. Take time to consider
what you want your visitors to learn from your site, and then make sure that
the information is front and center in your design and development plans.

What do you want users to do after or on visits to your Web site?
The more specific you can be about what you want visitors to do on your
site, the better. Do you want visitors to buy a product, hire you to perform a
service, join an association, call and ask for an appointment, sign up for a
newsletter, or just tell their friends and family how cool your Web site is?
Whatever you desire, you want your site’s design to encourage visitors to
take that action and to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.

Do you expect to make money on your Web site?
If your answer is “Of course I do!” that goal should shape everything you do
as you design the way visitors will use your site. Pay special attention to the
Fred’s Fine Furniture defined goals
To help you appreciate how the planning
process for a Web site could work, I’ll use
the fictitious business, Fred’s Fine Furniture,
as an example. After you complete the ini-
tial questionnaire earlier in this chapter, you
should create a list of goals that looks some-
thing like this:
 Promote Fred’s furniture store.
 Describe and showcase Fred’s custom
furniture services.
 Help customers easily find Fred’s contact
information, store hours, and location.
 Encourage site visitors to register their
tastes and furniture wish lists.
 Sign up visitors for Fred’s e-mail news-
letter.

section “Establishing a budget” later in this chapter, to make sure that you
see a return on your investment.
Besides being potential cash generators, Web sites can help you be more
competitive, advertise your store or services, schedule and inform staff,
and reduce travel and other types of expenses. Some of the most successful
Web sites are designed to save money by reducing long-distance phone
charges and other customer-support expenses.
Creating a content list
All the text, graphics, and multimedia elements that you want to display on the
pages of your Web site are commonly referred to as the content of the site. To help
guide your work and planning, your content list should include all photos, graphics,
biographies, product descriptions, maps, and other items that you might want to
feature on your site.
The best way to start creating a content list is to brainstorm all the things you think
you might want on the site, such as contact information, product descriptions,
logos, photos, graphics, and biographies.
The content list is a valuable tool that you can refer to as you develop your project
plan, site map, and task list. As you continue to develop the project plan and ulti-
mately the site, you’ll probably discover more things that you want to add to the
content list, so make sure to create it in a way that’s easy to add to and edit as you
progress.
A program like Microsoft Word (or, if you prefer, Excel), is an excellent tool for this
task because you can easily make additions and move content around as you
develop your list.
Use the content list as you organize your site content (see Chapter 3) and you’re
likely to think of additions to the content list as you work on that step. For example,
as the About Us page is created on the Fred’s Fine Furniture site featured in the 
Fred’s Fine Furniture content list
Continuing with Fred’s Fine Furniture as an
example, a content list might look like this: 
Company logo
Contact information
Photos of each piece of furniture
Descriptive paragraph for each piece of 
furniture
Pricing and ordering information
Photos that provide a tour of the showroom
Map to the showroom
Credit policies
Welcome message for the home page
Description of the newsletter and invitation
to sign up
Company description for the About Us page
Biography and photo of Fred

15
Chapter 1: Planning the Perfect Web Site
sidebars, Fred might realize that he wants to add a picture of the store, a map to the
store, and some text describing the company.
Creating a task list
The task list should be the heart of your project plan. It’s the list of tasks that must
be accomplished in order to meet your goals and launch your Web site.
You can create a task list in many ways, including a few software programs designed
to help with project management. If you’re creating a relatively simple Web site and
have a very small team, you need only a list with a few notes and dates attached to
each task. If you’re working on a more-complex project with a team, you might want
a program like Microsoft Project, which includes a variety of features designed to
make it easy to plan and track tasks over time.
When you create your task list, keep in mind that gathering your content is among
the most time-consuming aspects of your Web site project. Many people underesti-
mate how long it takes to gather all the photos, text descriptions, biographies, and
other elements you may want in a Web site. Break down the task of gathering con-
tent this way:

Gather existing content: You might already have much of the content 
you need in brochures, press releases, or other materials related to your
company or organization.

Digitize your text: If you’re including existing content in your site, you
might still have to do some work to get it all in digital format, where text is
converted into a word-processing or other text file.

Digitize images: If you already have photos you want to use, those images
might have to be scanned. Even if you already have digital photos, before
you can add them to a Web page, they must be in the correct format and

optimized, a process that helps them to be downloaded as quickly as possi-
ble over the Internet. (You can find step-by-step instructions for preparing
and optimizing images for the Web in Chapter 4.)

Create new content for your site: For example, you might want to create a
photo tour of your shop (to feature on the front page) or write or update
biographies of key personnel.
Setting a timeline
With your task list ironed out, you’re ready to create a timeline. Several popular pro-
grams can help. Microsoft Project can help you define a task, specify how long it
should take, and then associate it with other tasks on a timeline. If you don’t want to
spend the money on Microsoft Project or take the time to learn this somewhat com-
plex program, you can create a simple project plan in any calendar program or even
in a spreadsheet or word-processing program.
Your main goal is to create a timeline that can be adjusted if someone misses a dead-
line or if a project takes more (or less) time than expected.
Setting and enforcing deadlines can help you stick to your timeline: Even if you’re
working on a Web site by yourself, or with a very small team, setting deadlines can
be one of the most important parts of your project plan — and your best chance of
finishing. Most good Web sites are never-ending projects because you can always
add more content and develop them further — although you shouldn’t let it keep
you from getting your site launched. Set a deadline for at least the first phase of
development, and then hold yourself to it.
Be sure to give yourself a realistic timeframe to do a good job, and factor in a little
more time than you think you need, especially if you’re new to Web design. Tying a
deadline to a special event or occasion, even if you’re creating a personal site, can
help make you stick to the date. For example, set a launch date for a family Web site
on an occasion like your grandma’s birthday so that you can make it a surprise for
her. Or, plan to publish the redesign for your small-business site in time for a trade
show or annual sales event. When a deadline has a specific date and a clear goal
associated with it, it’s easier to take the deadlines seriously.
Establishing a budget
“How much does a Web site cost?” is often the first question asked by someone who
decides that they want a Web site. But, if you think about it, it’s a little like asking
how much it costs to build a house — the answer depends on how many rooms you
want, whether you want a marble or cement staircase, and whether you want a
swimming pool in the backyard. You may have no idea how much it costs to build a
home. After all, different contractors provide different price quotes based on how
experienced they are or the kinds of materials they plan to use. If you’re planning to
build the house yourself, it becomes your job to figure out whether the features you
want are reasonable and affordable.
Fortunately, most Web sites, at least the kind you’re likely to build yourself with the
templates and instructions provided in this book, don’t cost nearly as much as a
house. Before you can set a realistic budget, you need to break down the project into

17
Chapter 1: Planning the Perfect Web Site
pieces (by following the steps outlined earlier in this chapter) and then start adding
prices to the task list in your project plan. Determining the cost of each element of a
Web project helps you manage the cost and scope and estimate the overall costs.
Among the key costs you can expect are the ones in this list:

Web hosting: This service can cost as little as a few dollars a month or as
much as a couple hundred dollars, if you plan to include audio and video files,
which require more space on a server and more bandwidth to download.

Domain names: A domain name costs about $5 to $10 per year, although
you might want more than one domain name for the same site. (You can find
tips about hosting and registering domain names in Chapter 2.)

Your personal time: If you’re building a site yourself, one of your biggest
costs is likely to be the time you spend working on it.

Software programs: The tools used to create a Web site can range from free
to expensive. At the very least, consider getting an image-editing program
like Photoshop CS3 ($650), or Photoshop Elements ($99) — a fine alterna-
tive if you are not working with a lot of graphics. For Web design, I find
Adobe Dreamweaver ($399) is well worth the price.

Consulting services: Another major cost for do-it-yourselfers is any consult-
ing service you use to augment your own skills. For example, you might hire
an editor to review the text for your site or hire a programmer to create
complex, interactive features, like a password-protected section where you
keep clients informed as you work on their private projects.

Shopping system: If you want a shopping system, compare the costs of a
few and then include a rough estimate until you make a final decision. (You
find recommended services in Chapter 14.)
As you put together your budget, start with the clear-cut costs, like paying for a
domain name and hosting, and then move on to other items specific to your needs.
After you have a price quote for each element and begin putting the pieces together,
you can distinguish the more-expensive features and better decide which ones you
can afford now and which ones to add later.
Preparing for updates and maintenance
The Web provides a powerful vehicle for businesses and nonprofit organizations to
present their own side of any story and to get the word out quickly when tragic
events, bad press, or other crises arise.
Don’t wait for an emergency to happen to find out whether you’re prepared to add
new information to your Web site quickly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking that
just because you don’t manage a daily Internet newspaper, you don’t have to worry
about making speedy updates.
With a little planning and some key systems set up in advance, you can be prepared
for events that require timely information — whether an international crisis stops air
travel, a flood closes your nonprofit, or an embarrassing event makes your CEO
cringe and forces the real story to be told as soon as possible.

18
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Most organizations develop Web sites that are updated weekly, monthly, or even
annually. More sophisticated sites might link to databases that track inventory or
update product listings in real time, but even high-end sites are often ill prepared
to update special information quickly.
Here are a few things you can do to be prepared for timely updates on your site:

Make sure that you can send new information to your Web site quickly.
Many Web sites are designed with testing systems that safeguard against
careless mistakes, but these systems can add hours, or even days, to the
time it takes to add new information to your Web site. Work with your tech-
nical staff or consultants to make sure that you can update your site quickly
if necessary. You might have to create a new section that you can update
independently from the rest of the site or override the regular update
system.

Ensure that you can easily update important sections of your site.
Consider building or buying a content-management system that uses Web-
based forms to post new information to your site. This type of system can
be designed to change or add information to a Web page as easily as filling
out an online order form. You need an experienced programmer to develop
a form-based update system. Many Web consultants offer this kind of serv-
ice for a reasonable fee. For example, this method works if you’re a real
estate agent and you need to change listings or a calendar event. Include
password protection so that you control access to the form. As an added
benefit, a form enables you to make updates from any computer connected
to the Internet, so you can update your Web site even if you can’t get back
into your office.

Identify and train key staff to update the site. With the right systems in
place, you don’t need to have much technical experience to make simple
updates to a site, but your staff needs some instruction and regular
reminders. Make sure to also develop a schedule for retraining to ensure
that no one forgets emergency procedures. An extremely serious emergency
could happen tomorrow or might not happen for years — you never know,
so being prepared pays off in the end.
Assembling a team
Don’t go it alone! The best Web sites are developed by a team of people with a vari-
ety of skills, including writers, designers, programmers, and multimedia producers.
If you’re developing a relatively small, simple Web site, you might not need a lot of
people with specialized skills on your team, but the more you can divide the work
among experts, the better. Although the instructions and templates included with
this book are designed to help you do it yourself, you occasionally still have to seek
out specialists — like a good editor to ensure that your text is well written or a pro-
grammer who can create advanced features, like password-protected sections of a
Web site. Throughout this book, I’ve worked hard to give you the best and easiest
ways to create a Web site on your own, but I would be remiss not to point out that
hiring a specialist or two once in a while can be a helpful way to complement the
work you do yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

 Registering a domain name
 Understanding why you need Web hosting
 Choosing a hosting service
T
he most important part of a Web site may be what you put on the pages: the
information, services, or products you offer. To pull it all together, however,
you also need a domain name and a server, a computer with special software where
you can publish your site on the Web.
In the first part of this chapter, you discover how domain name registration works,
what to do if the name you want is already taken, and where you go to search for
domain names for free. In the second part of this chapter, you find a list of questions
you should ask before you choose a Web hosting service. Using the same service to
host your Web site that you use to register your domain name is the simplest solu-
tion, but not always the most economical, or the one that is most likely to best serve
your needs. The information you find here will help you choose among the many
services available.
Whether you’re creating a Web site for your business, hobby, or family, you’ll want
to follow the steps in this chapter to register a domain name and select a Web host.
You start creating the pages of your Web site in Part II, but the preliminary steps in
this chapter ensure that everything will be set up when you’re ready to launch your
new Web site.
Finding and Registering Domain Names
The address for a Web site is its domain name. For example, Wiley Publishing, 
the company that published this book, has a Web site with the domain name
www.wiley.com. The company also has a Web site with the domain name
www.dummies.com, for the For Dummies book series.
Even before you start building a Web site, I recommend that you register your own
domain name. The process is simple and painless and costs less than $10 per year. If
you don’t register a domain name, your Web site’s address will be an extension of

20
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
the domain that your service provider registered and will probably look something
like this:
www.serviceprovider.com/users/wiley
If you register a domain name, you can point the name wherever your Web site is
hosted, and your address should look more like this:
www.wiley.com
Choosing a good domain name
Your domain name is your calling card — it should be short and sweet and easy to
say and write. If your Web address is too long or complex, it’s hard for anyone to
remember or type on a keyboard. The best domain name for your site is easy to
remember, easy to convey (it can be said in one simple sentence), and easy to spell.
A shortened version of your business name may seem like a better domain name
because it requires less typing, but if your customers know you by your full name,
they may be confused. For example, the official site for American Airlines is
www.aa.com, but the company was smart enough to register more than one name,
so if you type www.americanairlines.com, your browser goes to the same site.
When you’re tossing around ideas for a domain name, keep these rules in mind:

Domain names aren’t case sensitive. For example, you can get to my Web
site by entering www.digitalfamily.com or www.DigitalFamily.com.
(See Figure 2-1.) I prefer to capitalize the D and F in my domain name when I
print it on business cards or other collateral, because it makes the domain
name easier to read.
Figure 2-1: Both www.DigitalFamily.com and www.digital
family.com take you to the same Web site.

21
Chapter 2: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host

Any characters that appear after a domain name extension are case 
sensitive (the dot-com or dot-org part of the address, for example). Thus,
www.JanineWarner.com/books isn’t the same address as
www.JanineWarner.com/Books.

Although you can use a hyphen or an underscore in a domain name, it’s
generally simpler to use a combination of words run together. For exam-
ple, you can register www.the-digital-family.com, but that’s harder to
convey verbally because you have to explain the hyphens. If you simply use
www.digitalfamily.com, you can say, “My address is Digital Family dot
com, all one word.”

Domain names cannot contain spaces, periods, apostrophes, or other
punctuation.

Make sure that your domain name doesn’t violate a trademark. You 
can do a simple trademark search at www.uspto.gov. If you’re starting a
business or concerned about violating someone’s trademark, consult an
attorney.
Searching for an available domain name
You can register any domain name that hasn’t already been taken by someone else.
Finding out whether a name is already in use is easy — and free. To see whether a
domain name is already registered, do a simple search at any domain registration
Web site. All domain registrars check the same master databases that track all
domain names on the Web. Hundreds of sites offer the service; the following steps
use 1and1.com as an example, but most work the same way:
1. Use a Web browser to visit a domain name registrar.
In this example, I’m using www.1and1.com.
2. In the Search area on the registrar’s site, type the name you want to register.
In Figure 2-2, I’m searching for www.bookkeeper.com.
3. Click to begin your search.
The results of your search are displayed. (If you use www.1and1.com, 
for example, you click the Go button.) The results for a search on
www.bookkeeper.com (which not surprisingly was already taken) are
shown in Figure 2-2.
4. If the name you want isn’t available and you don’t like the alternatives
offered, you can enter another name to see whether it’s available.
Domain registrars don’t limit the number of names you can search for in
any given search session.

22
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Figure 2-2: If the name you want isn’t available, most registrars offer a list of recommended alternatives.
Disputing a domain name
What if your name — either your personal
name or your company name — is already
taken, and you want to have it (or don’t like
what someone else is doing with it)?
Unless the owner has opted for private reg-
istrations, you can find out to whom a
domain name is registered by searching in
the Whois database, a central registry of all
domain registrants on the Internet. One site
where you can search this database is
www.networksolutions.com/whois, but
most domain-registration sites include a
More Info link for finding out about a taken
domain. Most registration listings in the
Whois database include the street address,
phone number, and e-mail address of the
person or business that registered the
domain name in addition to information
about the server or service provider that
hosts the domain.
If you have your heart set on a registered
domain name, you can contact the owner
and try negotiating. Many people have reg-
istered names that they aren’t using, and 
if you find one that’s registered but not in
use, the owner might be willing to sell for a
reasonable price. I know many people who
have picked up great domain names for
$500 to $1,000.
To date, the courts seem to be applying the
same laws to domain names that they apply
to trademarks. For example, if you have a
legal trademark such as Levi, and someone
registers www.levi.com before you do, you
can probably go to court and force the
person to give you the domain name,
although domain name disputes can be
lengthy and expensive. If you don’t have a
trademark, you may have no alternative
than to try to buy it from the person or
choose another name instead.
If you think you have a case against some-
one who has taken your name, don’t bother
the registration service with your complaint.
Domain registrars don’t handle domain
name disputes; they just register names on
a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, talk
to the guilty party directly. If that doesn’t
work, take the matter to court. If you can get
a judge to rule that you’re right, the domain
registration service revokes the name and
lets you have it.

23
Chapter 2: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
Don’t get frustrated if you find that the domain name you want is already taken. You
can almost always find a name that will serve you well if you try a few variations.
Here are a few tips for finding a suitable variation:

Add a word or phrase that indicates geographic location or makes the
name more specific: For example, if www.news.com is taken, consider
www.PointReyesNews.com or www.WestMarinNews.com.

Sometimes a different name that has similar meaning can work: For exam-
ple, you can try to register www.PointReyesReports.com.

Try looking for playful names: For example, www.Accountant.com is
taken, but you might still find www.FunnyAccountants.com or
www.FrugalAccountants.com.
Before you choose a close variation (or any domain name, for that matter), always
check for sites whose names are similar to yours. Don’t choose a name that’s too
close to someone else’s if they are a competitor or if they have a site you would be
embarrassed to be associated with. Similarly, consider whether others have already
set up sites with your domain name but a different domain name ending.
Registering your domain name
The specifics of registering a domain name vary among the services but the basic
domain registration process is similar. Typically, after you perform your search, you
are given instructions for registering the name, as well as offers to buy other kinds of
services. In most cases, you need to select or decline options that the service has to
offer and then proceed to pay for the services you selected. Common types of serv-
ices, in addition to registration, are

Hosting: Many registration services also offer Web site hosting (covered
later in this chapter). 

E-mail: Typically, you have the option of creating one or more e-mail
addresses associated with your domain name.

Privacy: Most services allow you to choose whether your contact informa-
tion as the owner of this domain name is readily available to others through
a search on the Whois database. Most services charge a fee for private reg-
istration, which is kind of like having an unlisted phone number.
In addition to registering your main domain name — the one you plan to hand out to
colleagues and clients or friends and family — my best advice is to register every
variation and misspelling of your name that you can think of and direct those
domain names to your Web site. Just because some people didn’t do well in the
third-grade spelling bee doesn’t mean that they don’t have money to buy your prod-
ucts or services online.
Directing more than one domain name to the same Web site is a relatively simple
technical detail that you can arrange through your Internet service provider or 
the company where you register the name. And, it’s not that expensive. At the 
time this book was being written, godaddy.com charged $9.99 per year 
www.networksolutions.com charged $14.99; and www.1and1.com charged $5.99.

24
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Also consider registering the same name with different domain endings, such as
.org, .net, and, most important, .com. The educational Web site Whyville, for
example, registered whyville.org (the domain ending used by most nonprofits),
but they also registered whyville.com because many people will assume that’s the
address. Owning these additional domains can also prevent you or your visitors
from potential embarrassment or misrepresentation. 
Most people consider the.com version of a name the most valuable, but if the .com
version is unavailable, registering the .net, .biz, or .info versions may be a fine
alternative. Just make sure that the site that has the .com version isn’t a direct 
competitor or a site that you would be embarrassed by if your visitors found it 
accidentally.
Technically, when you register a domain name, you are leasing it, not purchasing it,
which means it’s possible to lose a domain name. Make sure your registration
remains valid by renewing it when your registration service requires.
Understanding top-level domains 
When you search for a domain name, you need to determine not only the first part of
the name but also the ending, commonly called top-level domains or TLDs. Table 2-1
provides a list of the most common domain name endings, their intended purposes,
and their restrictions.
The .com domain has emerged as the most valuable because it’s the best recognized
and the one that people are most likely to remember. However, all these domains
work the same way in terms of directing users to a Web site address. For example,
www.smith.com, www.smith.net, and www.smith.org work the same way on
the Internet.
Whether you use the www at the beginning of a domain name depends on how the
domain is set up on your Web server. Most servers are set up so that a user is
directed to a Web site with or without the www. Similarly, servers can be configured
so that additional names can be added before the domain, such as
news.google.com or maps.google.com.
Register your own name
I tell all my friends that they should register
their own names as domain names because
owning your own name is a key part of 
protecting your online reputation. A per-
sonal Web site serves as a great way to pro-
mote yourself, whether you are job hunting,
developing a consulting business, or simply
want to share your story with the world. And
because search engines tend to give prior-
ity to keywords that match domain names,
your site should score high when someone
searches your name if you’ve registered the
domain. Even if you don’t plan to use your
domain name right away, registering it will
prevent anyone else from setting up a site
at your name.

Comparing country domains: .tv, .us, and .ws
Nearly every country in the world now has its own domain, such as .us for the
United States, .am for Armenia, .br for Brazil, .uk for the United Kingdom, and 
.zw for Zimbabwe.
A few foreign country codes have become popular in the United States because they
represent common acronyms, such as .tv, which many assume stands for televi-
sion but is really the domain name for the country of Tuvalu. (You can find a Tuvalu
Web site at www.tuvula.tv.) Similarly, .ws is assumed to mean Web site (and is
even listed that way on some registrar sites), but it’s the country code for Western
Samoa. You can register a name with the .ws or .tv domain even if you don’t live in
one of those countries, but some countries have restrictions, and country domains
are often more expensive to register than .com or .org names.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Questions to Ask of Potential 
Web Hosting Services
After you register your domain name, the next step is to arrange for some kind of
Web hosting service, such as DreamHost, shown in Figure 2-3. For the purposes of
this book, I’m going to assume you don’t want to run your own Web server, which is
much more complex than building a Web site and not necessary for anyone who
isn’t running an extremely large Web site.
How do you find a Web host with all the features you need for your Web site? And,
how do you even know what to ask?
Figure 2-3: The DreamHost service offers competitive rates for accounts that can handle multiple sites, each
with their own domain names, which makes it easy for me to host sites for a few of my family and
friends.
The best place to look for a Web host is also the most obvious: Look online! If you
search for Web hosts in a search engine, you find millions of matches to choose
from. For more qualified recommendations, ask around and get references from
people you trust, especially those with Web sites you admire.
After you narrow your options, shop around. Running a Web server is an increas-
ingly competitive business, and not all companies offer the same features. Before
you select a Web host, consider what you want on your Web site and make sure that
you find a service that meets your needs. Your goal is to find the provider with the
best collection of services within your budget. The following sections highlight a few
questions to ask as you explore the features that different services offer.

27
Chapter 2: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
“How much do you charge?”
Choosing a Web host is a little like choosing a cell phone company or a long-distance
carrier. In theory, all phone companies provide the same capability to make a phone
call, but as you probably know, in practice, they offer vastly different rate plans and
special services.
My best advice is to get a good start on the development plan for your site before you
shop around for a service provider so that you know which kinds of services you
need. (You can find more information about planning a Web project in Chapter 1.) You
might decide, for example, that you want 24-hour technical support so that you can
get help at night after work, but you don’t want to pay extra for secure financial
transactions because you don’t plan to sell products online.
In general, the big-ticket items at Web hosting services are:

Bandwidth: Bandwidth measures the carrying capacity of a connection on
the Internet. Compare it to a garden hose and its capacity to transport
water: The larger the diameter of the hose, the more water it can carry.
Bandwidth works the same way: The greater the bandwidth, the faster the
transmission of information. Bandwidth gets expensive if lots of people visit
your site, because more visitors mean more use of the connection. If you
want to offer streaming video or audio files, they can also use up a lot of
bandwidth, and you’ll have to pay a premium for hosting.

Disk space: The bigger your site — the more images and especially the
more sound files, video, and animation files you include — the more you’ll
pay for the disk space to host it. Because video files are much larger than
images or text files, video takes up much more hard disk space and requires
more bandwidth to be viewed. As a result, providing many hours of video
on your site can be expensive. 

E-commerce: Some Web hosting packages include secure e-commerce capa-
bilities and sophisticated programming options. Unless you’re planning to
sell products or services on your site or to publish large amounts of video
or sound files, you’ll probably do fine with the simplest or lowest-level Web
hosting package your service provider offers.

Streaming media: If you want to offer audio, video, or Flash animations on
your Web site, check whether your hosting service features the capability to
stream your multimedia files. It’s a nice option: Streaming is what enables
visitors to your site to start playing a video or audio file while it is down-
loading, instead of having to wait for the entire file to download before it
can be started. 
“Do you provide e-commerce services?”
Many Web hosting services, such as those provided by Yahoo!, shown in Figure 2-4,
provide e-commerce features in addition to hosting and domain registration all in
one place. If you’re thinking of starting a business or taking your existing business

28
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
online, you may want to make sure your service provider can handle e-commerce
transactions. If you plan to sell a lot of products, I also recommend a shopping cart
system, which is a program that enables visitors to add products to a checkout page
that tracks and tallies selected items as a visitor moves through your site. You can
buy shopping cart systems separately, but many service providers, such as Yahoo!,
include shopping cart features as part of their online store services. (You find more
information about selling products on the Web in Chapter 13.)
Figure 2-4: Some Web hosting services, such as Yahoo!, provide e-commerce capabilities.
“Do you offer technical support?”
If you run into trouble uploading or maintaining your site, you might need to contact
your hosting company to find out specifics about connecting to its Web server. If you
want to use more-advanced services, such as an e-commerce system, you’re even
more likely to need its help. The bottom line: Technical support is important, and it’s
always a good idea to make sure you can get help when you need it.
Some Web hosting services have knowledgeable technical support staff on call 24
hours a day; others might never answer the phone but respond instead to e-mail
inquiries. Before you even sign up for service, e-mail a few questions or call the tech
support line of the service providers you’re considering to see how long it takes
each one to respond to your initial questions. If you have trouble getting your initial
questions answered from a Web hosting service, you’ll probably have even more
trouble getting help after the Web host has your money.
Most Web hosts post frequently asked questions (FAQs) on their Web sites. FAQs
can be a great place to get answers to common questions and to find out about
common problems other users are having — before you even sign up.

29
Chapter 2: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
Expect your Web host to give you basic assistance, such as helping you understand
the specific aspects of how to log on to its server and upload your pages. However,
few Web hosts provide help with Web design and development, so don’t judge them
badly if they don’t give you advice about the design or graphics for your site.
“Which backup systems 
do you have in place?”
Backup systems are crucial on the Internet — technical problems are common,
servers go down, and the contents of a Web server can be lost if it’s not backed up
regularly. Any reputable service provider should have a regular backup system in
place. If someone balks when you ask about the backup system, the provider proba-
bly isn’t reliable or well run.
Always keep a backup of your Web site on your own computer. You’re probably
doing this already if you created the site on your hard drive, but you should keep an
extra copy of the site on an external hard disk or a CD. If you use consultants to do
any of the work for you, get copies of their work. Similarly, if other members of your
team are working on the site, make sure you collect their work in one place and keep
it backed up.
“Can I host more than one domain name?”
As you compare options, you might notice that some providers charge more for
packages that enable you to host multiple domain names. You might choose a pack-
age that supports multiple domain names if you want each member of the family to
be able to register their own domain name and set up their own site separately or if
you run multiple companies or information sites. For example, you can set up www.
JeanDoherty.com, www.JoshDoherty.com, and www.TheDohertyFamily.com
as separate sites on the same account if it supports multiple domains. Although a
Web hosting package that supports multiple domain names is generally more expen-
sive, it might save you money compared to the cost of setting up a different Web
hosting account for each Web site you want to create.
Note that there’s a difference between hosting multiple domain names that point 
to different Web sites, as in the example in the preceding paragraph, and pointing
two or more domain names to the same site. If you want two names, such as
www.TheDohertyFamily.com and www.TheDohertys.com, to direct visitors to
the same site, you can manage that situation with your domain name registrar and
save the cost of a premium Web server account that supports multiple domain
names. Check with your domain name registrar for more information on how to
direct multiple domain names to the same Web server.

 Styling Web pages with CSS
O
ver the years, Web design has evolved dramatically, and creating Web sites
has become much more complex. Fortunately, the tools and services now
available make many aspects of Web design easier, and make even the most compli-
cated features simpler than ever to add to your site.
The first commercial Web pages, which began appearing on the Internet in the mid-
1990s, were limited to static photos and text with extremely simple layouts. Now you
can create rich media Web experiences with audio, video, interactive games, shop-
ping carts, and complex designs that weren’t even possible back then.
To help you lay the groundwork for the options that are now possible, this chapter
helps you

Create a great-looking design that’s easy to use and attracts and retains 
visitors.

Make decisions about the underlying structure of a site — namely, how to
organize the content on the site’s pages and ensure that visitors can intu-
itively use the navigation system.

Understand what the leading image-editing Web design programs have to
offer.

Understand how modern Web pages are created using HTML (the HyperText
Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and multimedia. Although
you don’t have to look at the code to use the templates featured in this
book, having at least a general understanding of how Web pages work can
go a long way toward helping you understand which features can easily be
added to a Web page and which ones require more training or specialized
services. For example, creating a survey or poll on a Web site requires
advanced programming skills, unless you use a service like 
SurveyMonkey.com, featured in Chapter 14.

If you like having the bigger picture before you get started on the practical applica-
tions, this chapter is for you. If you just want to get to work on your first Web page,
feel free to jump ahead to any chapter in this book. Just remember that this chapter
is designed to help you understand why some tasks on the Web are easy to do and
why others are challenging.
Appreciating the Many Approaches 
to Web Design
If you’ve never created a Web site, you may not realize how many ways you can pub-
lish photos and other information on the Web, or how many software programs and
service providers you can choose from. You’ve probably seen Web sites in many
styles, but you may not realize that the different looks of those sites sometimes
depend on the type of technology used to create them.
This list briefly describes some of the types of Web sites you can create:

Online photo album: One of the fastest and easiest ways to put photos
online is to use one of the free online photo album sites, such as Flickr.com,
KodakGallery.com, or Shutterfly.com. Most photo sites make their money by
charging for prints, which they’re happy to send to you or your loved ones
for about 20 or 30 cents apiece.

Free online service: Several online services, such as Geocities.com,
Angelfire.com, and Tripod.com, offer free Web sites. The catch is that these
companies then sell advertising on your pages, and you have no control
over which ads run next to your words and pictures.

Blogging software: Millions of people now have blogs, or online journals, on
the Internet. These sites’ popularity has spawned a variety of software pro-
grams designed to facilitate easy updates, such as Blogger.com. A blog may
be your best option if you want to make frequent updates to your Web site.
You can even add a blog to a Web site you created in a program like
Dreamweaver. This approach, covered in Chapter 10, combines the best of
both worlds.

Predesigned template: I included a collection of templates in this book so
that you can easily create a variety of common Web sites, such as a portfo-
lio site or wedding site. To use the templates featured in Chapters 6 through
8, you need the Web design program Adobe Dreamweaver, and an image
program, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements. Creating a site based on a
template is much easier than creating a site from scratch, and you can
always edit and customize templates to suit your preferences. For a quick
look at what you can do with the companion templates, check out the color
insert in this book.

Database-driven: The most-sophisticated Web sites on the Internet, such as
the online store at Amazon.com or the news site at CNN.com, were created
using complex programming and databases. Combining a database that
records information about users with the capability to automatically gener-
ate pages enables Amazon to greet you by name when you return to its site,
track your orders as you buy books, and even make recommendations

33
Chapter 3: Understanding Web Design
based on your previous purchases. Although these kinds of advanced fea-
tures are quite expensive and complex to create, you can add many similar
features, such as an online shopping cart, by using the online services cov-
ered in Chapter 13.
Designing Your Web Site
No matter how technically sophisticated a Web site is or how creative its writing,
most people notice a site’s design first. Make sure that you leave plenty of time and
reserve funds in the budget to develop an appropriate and attractive design for your
Web site. The right design is one that best suits your audience — and that may or
may not mean lots of fancy graphics and animations. To pinpoint the right design for
your site, follow these guidelines:

Before you develop the design, think about whom you want to attract to
your Web site. A gaming Web site geared toward teenagers should look
much different from a Web site with gardening tips or an online banking site
for adults.

Review other sites designed for your target market. Study the way other
sites use images, set up navigation, and organize information. You don’t
want your site to look exactly like your competition, because you want your
site to stand out (and you shouldn’t just copy someone else’s design), but
you can certainly gain useful ideas from reviewing other people’s sites.

Keep in mind how your design decisions might affect download times.
Consider your audience’s time constraints, attention span, and (most impor-
tantly) goals. If you design your site to provide information to busy business-
people, you want fast-loading pages with few graphics and little or no
animation. If you design your site for entertainment, your audience might be
willing to wait a little longer for animation and other interactive features.
Creating a consistent design
Most Web sites work best, and are easiest to navigate, when they follow a consistent
design. Here’s a case in point: Most readers take for granted that books don’t change
their design from page to page and that newspapers don’t change headline fonts and
logos from day to day. Consistency is one of the primary tools used in books and
newspapers to help readers easily distinguish different elements and follow a story
or theme.
As you lay out your Web page, keep related items close to one another and be con-
sistent about how you design similar content elements. This type of organization
makes following information visually much easier. Viewers should instantly under-
stand which pieces of information are related to each other. Distinguish different
kinds of information by their

Design: Make sure that similar elements follow the same design parameters,
such as type style, banner size, and page background color. To ensure a
consistent style, define a set of colors, shapes, or other elements that you
use throughout the site. Choose two or three fonts for your Web site, and

34
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
use them consistently. Using too many fonts makes your pages less appeal-
ing and harder to read. 
You can easily get dazzled by all the affects, filters, and tools you can create
in an image editor or add to a Web page by copying and pasting some code.
Don’t fall into the trap of using fancy features just because you can. (“Look,
Ma — I made the text on my Web page blink in neon pink!”) Keep in mind
that the most important thing is to make your photos and Web pages look
good and download quickly on the Internet.

Location: The position of elements on a page can strongly affect the amount
of attention they receive. Many Internet studies have shown that text and
images toward the top of the page get the most attention.

Prominence: Give elements of similar importance the same weight on a
page. If you use too many different elements on a page or on the same Web
site, you can confuse your viewers.
Strive for consistency in your designs — except when you’re trying to be unpre-
dictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web site lively.
Mapping the structure: Organization, 
navigation, and links
Helping visitors get around your site is a critical part of your site’s design. Regardless
of how much content you have on your site, the time-honored Web design tricks you
find in this section help you organize content into pages, develop a navigation
system, and identify where to place links strategically throughout your site.
Organizing the contents of your pages
As you start planning the organization of your pages, consider these questions:

When visitors arrive at your home page, where do you want them to go?

How will visitors move around your site?

How will visitors find the information that’s important to them?
A good way to help answer these questions is to imagine that you’re a typical user of
your site. For example, you might say, “If I were a busy executive who came to my site
looking for a new couch for my living room, what would make it easy for me to find it?”
Using your answers as well as your content list, decide which information you want
to appear on the home page and how to organize its subsections. This basic struc-
ture of the home page and its subpages is typically the basis of a site’s menu bar, one
of the more-common navigational elements. All templates featured in this book
include some kind of navigational menu that you can easily edit to include links to
the main pages of your site, such as Home, Contact, and Products. Adding the menu
bar to each page on the site provides visitors with a useful navigational tool because
it lets them easily access main sections from anywhere within the site.

35
Chapter 3: Understanding Web Design
Here’s an example of a menu bar you might create with a row of links to the main
sections of a small-business site:
Home Page ~ About Us ~ Products ~ Services ~ Contact Info
As you create the bare bones of your site organization and navigation, think also
about where you’re likely to add content down the road. Be sure to ask useful ques-
tions during the planning process: What will you do when you have more products?
Where will you put the products? How will you locate those pages again when some-
one wants to change a product price? If you’re working on a publication, for exam-
ple, consider how to build in new issues, how to link with new stories, and where to
archive old information.
Whatever you do, never let users “get stuck” on a page because the link is broken or
labeled Under Construction. Good Web sites are always under construction. Let visi-
tors know that new treats are coming by putting notices on pages that already have
content.
Streamlining the navigation
A good Web site is designed so that users can navigate easily and intuitively and
create their own paths to find the information most relevant to them. As you start to
work on the design, make sure that users can easily access key information from
more than one place in the site and that they can move back and forth between the
main pages and sections.
As you plan the navigation of your site, make sure that visitors can

Follow different paths to the same important information. It might seem
repetitive at first, but providing more than one link to the same page makes
it easier for visitors to find their way around your site. For example, if you
have a family history section, you might want to link to that page from many
other pages in your site, such as the page about your daughter’s wedding as
well as the page about your grandparents.

Move back and forth between pages and sections. Links that help users
move forward and backward through a site can be especially useful in a
slide show or an image gallery.

Add a search feature. If you have a lot of content on your Web site, con-
sider adding a way for users to search through your pages. One simple solu-
tion is the Google Mini Search Appliance, which you can search for at
Google.com.
Follow the three-clicks rule, which states that no important piece of information
should ever be more than three clicks away from anywhere else on your Web site.
The most important information should be even closer at hand. Some information,
such as contact information, should never be more than one click away. 

36
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Reviewing Web Design and 
Graphics Programs
CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and all the other techy stuff you need in order to create Web
pages is much easier to manage when you use a Web design program, such as Adobe
Dreamweaver CS3 or Microsoft Expression Web. To help you appreciate the differ-
ences between these programs, you find brief descriptions and more in the following
section. Then I review a number of image-editing programs to help you understand
your many options in that arena.
No matter which software programs you choose for image editing or Web design, the
basic concepts are the same. Ideally, an image editor should optimize images so that
they download quickly over the Internet, and a Web-design program should create
pages that look good to all visitors, no matter which browsers they use. For this
book, I chose Dreamweaver CS3 for creating Web pages because it is by far the most
popular Web design program on the market — and an excellent option for creating
pages that look good to a wide variety of visitors. I chose Photoshop Elements 5 for
graphics because it can create great images for the Web, yet it’s relatively easy to
use and reasonably priced. If you prefer to use the more-professional Photoshop CS3
instead, you should still be able to follow the instructions in this book because the
program features I use are quite similar.
Although I believe that Photoshop Elements and Dreamweaver are the best pro-
grams for do-it-yourselfers on the Web, I wrote this section to help you understand
the strengths and weaknesses of the most-popular Web-design programs so that you
can find the program that’s best for you now and in the future.
Comparing image-editing programs
You can find many choices in the world of image-editing programs, from high-end
programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, to “prosumer” (professional consumer) prod-
ucts, like Photoshop Elements, to simple programs that you can download for free
over the Internet. Here’s a quick comparison of some of the most-popular image-edit-
ing programs:

Adobe Photoshop CS3: By far the most popular image editing program in
the history of computer design, the powerful Photoshop CS3 lets you
create, edit, and manipulate images. It’s a professional tool, with a profes-
sional price tag (about $650), so unless you have a big budget or you’re a
serious photographer or designer, Photoshop CS3 is probably more than
you need (or want to pay for). You can download a 30-day free trial version
at www.adobe.com/photoshop.

Adobe Photoshop Elements 5: Shown in Figure 3-1, Photoshop Elements 5
features many of the same powerful tools as Photoshop CS3, but it’s easier
to use and costs only about $100. Elements provides more than enough
power for almost anything you need to do on a Web site, including optimiz-
ing images so that they download faster over the Internet. You find an intro-
duction to Elements and instructions for creating and optimizing graphics
for the Web in Chapter 4.

Chapter 3: Understanding Web Design
The difference between Photoshop and Photoshop Elements boils down to
this: The expensive version is used by magazine editors and high-fashion
photographers, for example, to perform painstaking, exacting work on their
photos, to make flawless images that are optimized for print and suitable for
viewing by millions of people. (Given enough time, you can use Photoshop
to make a mule look like a supermodel.) For the rest of us, who just want to
edit photos or perhaps create the impression that Uncle Ernie’s basset
hound is driving the lawnmower, Photoshop Elements 5 is all that’s ever
needed. You can download a 30-day free trial version at www.adobe.com/
elements.

Adobe Fireworks CS3: This image-design program has many special fea-
tures for creating attractive images on the Web. With Fireworks, you can
create animated images and slide shows for your Web pages. You can also
create images in Fireworks and use the special slicing tool to cut the image
into pieces before exporting it directly into a fully functional Web page. This
feature makes Fireworks a favorite among many designers who like to create
their page layouts in Fireworks, and then slice them so that the images can
be optimized for the Web, and let Fireworks automatically re-create the
design in HTML. Because Fireworks is integrated with Dreamweaver, you
can move back and forth between the two programs, which makes it easier
to make changes to designs that use lots of images. You can download a 
30-day free trial version at www.adobe.com/fireworks.
Figure 3-1: Photoshop Elements is a great tool for creating and optimizing images for the Web, and it’s more
reasonably priced than Adobe’s professional program, Photoshop CS3.

Free image-editing programs: Search the Web for free photo editor and
you find many listed, but only a few that are even worth downloading. If
you’re willing to settle for a more-limited program to save money, consider
the online editor at www.irfanview.com or download the popular GIMP
(GNU Image Manipulation Program). You can find this open-source editor
(available for Windows, Unix, and Linux) at www.gimp.org.

Comparing Web-design programs
In the early days of the Web, people were using lots of different visual HTML editors.
Today only a few major ones are in common use on the Web: Adobe Dreamweaver
and Microsoft Expression Web. Both programs are available for

Adobe Dreamweaver CS3: By far the most popular choice among profes-
sional Web designers, this award-winning program offers high-end develop-
ment tools, excellent design features, and valuable support for all the latest
Internet technologies. Dreamweaver features a wide collection of customiz-
able palettes, floating dialog boxes, and toolbars, which makes it look more
like an image editor than a word processor. If you’re serious about Web
design, this is the tool to use. That’s why I chose Dreamweaver to feature in
this book. If you don’t have a copy of Dreamweaver yet, you can download a
fully functional 30-day trial version for free by visiting www.Adobe.com/
dreamweaver.
You find an introduction to Dreamweaver in Chapter 5 and step-by-step
instructions for customizing the various templates featured in this book in
Chapters 6, 7, and 8. When you’re ready for more advanced design with
Dreamweaver, you find a collection of online tutorials at www.digital
family.com/dreamweaver (shown in Figure 3-2), including excerpts of
my book Dreamweaver CS3 For Dummies (Wiley Publishing).
Figure 3-2: You can find Dreamweaver tutorials on my DigitalFamily Web site.

Adobe Contribute CS3: Contribute is designed to make it easy for anyone to
“contribute” to a Web site. This reasonably priced program is easy and intu-
itive to use, but it’s not a stand-alone program. Contribute isn’t designed to
create Web sites — it’s designed to help you easily update an existing site.

39
Chapter 3: Understanding Web Design
You need a program like Dreamweaver to complete a Web site from start to
finish. Contribute is an ideal choice if you’re creating a site in Dreamweaver
using the templates in this book and you want to make it easy for other
people who know little or nothing about the Web to update the site.

Microsoft Expression Web: The newest contender in the Web design arena,
Microsoft Expression Web (shown in Figure 3-3) is a professional Web-design
program designed to replace Microsoft FrontPage. Although Expression Web
was launched as a completely new program from Microsoft, FrontPage users
are encouraged to upgrade to Expression Web, and FrontPage is no longer
being developed by Microsoft. You can download a free trial version at
www.microsoft.com/expression.
Figure 3-3: The new Web page editor Expression Web enables you to create CSS-based designs.
Understanding How Web Pages Work
Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari are designed to display
text, images, and other files on a computer screen. Essentially, browsers read the
HTML and other code that makes up the text in a Web page and use the code to
interpret how the page should be displayed to visitors.
Because HTML is a markup language, it’s designed to “mark up” a page, or to provide
instructions for how a Web page should look. Contrary to popular belief, HTML isn’t a
programming language, and it isn’t capable of creating interactive features or even
moving elements on a screen without help. For more-advanced features, like rollover
effects, you need something more capable of interactivity, such as JavaScript. If you

40
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
want to collect information from visitors with a form or keep track of users’ purchases
as they move through your site, you need a robust programming language — like Perl,
C#, or Java — that’s capable of creating advanced Web systems, like shopping carts
and interactive surveys.
If you’re starting to worry that this book is getting a lot more technical than you
expected, relax. I assure you, you don’t learn any advanced programming in this
book. I do, however, want you to understand that some tasks are relatively easy to
do on the Web, like creating an online gallery where you can show off your photos.
Other features are more complex to create, like a password-protected Web site or an
online shopping system.
Avoid doing the programming yourself by reading Chapters 13 and 14 — they have
lists of online services that you can use to add these types of advanced features to
your site.
Using HTML and CSS together
Most Web pages are now created using HTML and CSS. HTML came first, but CSS has
become the darling of the Web because it enables designers to better format and
position elements on a page.
How the two work together can get a bit complicated, but you essentially use HTML
to create the structure of a page, insert images, add line breaks, and perform similar
tasks. Then you create styles in CSS that control how those elements look and where
they appear on a page.
All the templates featured in this book are written in HTML and formatted with CSS.
In Chapters 5 through 8, you find specific instructions for using Adobe Dreamweaver
to edit the templates and customize them to meet the needs of any Web site you
want to create. I did everything I can to make these templates as versatile, and easy
to use as possible, but the more you understand about CSS and HTML, the better
you can customize them.
HTM-what? Exploring HTML
If you want to see what the code behind a Web page looks like in most browsers, you
can choose View➪Source to see the underlying code. If you’re using Dreamweaver,
shown in the following figure, you can click the Split button, in the upper-left corner
of the workspace, to see the code and the design areas of the program at the same
time. Split view in Dreamweaver is a useful way to keep an eye on what’s going on
behind the scenes and to find out how to use HTML as you go along. And, the two
views are completely integrated, so if you select something in Design view, like the
headline you see in Figure 3-4, the same text is highlighted in Code view.

41
Chapter 3: Understanding Web Design
Figure 3-4: The Split view option in Dreamweaver makes it possible to display in the workspace both the
page design and the code behind the page.
When you view the HTML code behind any Web page, you find text and other ele-
ments surrounded by tags. If at first glance you think that HTML code looks like
hieroglyphics, don’t give up too quickly. With just a little training, you can start to
recognize at least some common tags, like the H1 tag (Heading 1 tag) that was used
to format the headline on the page shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5: The H1 tag is highlighted in Dreamweaver Code view.
Understanding the following basic principles of tags can help you figure out how the
underlying code works:

HTML tags are set off in brackets < > and include an opening and a clos-
ing tag. For example, the tag that makes text appear in boldface looks like
this: <b>. The corresponding close tag looks like this: <b>. A close tag,
which always begins with a forward slash /, tells a Web browser to stop
doing whatever the open tag started. Thus, if you want to make a word bold
in HTML, you surround it by a <b> tag and a close <b> tag. Any text that
appears between those two tags is then displayed in bold by a Web browser.
(The text before or after those tags is unaffected.)

HTML includes many tags designed to be hierarchical. Examples are the
H1 through H6 tags, which are ideally suited to formatting text according to
its importance on a Web page. Reserve the H1 tag for the most important
text on the page, such as a headline. H2 is ideal for subheads or secondary
headings, for example.

42
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 

Some tags are more complex than the simple bold tag or the heading
tags. These more complicated tags, such as those that create links or insert
images into pages, are more challenging to use.
At its heart, HTML is just text, and believe it or not, you can write an HTML docu-
ment in a plain-text editor as simple as Notepad or SimpleText. If you ever try it,
however, you’re sure to quickly appreciate programs — such as Dreamweaver —
that write the code for you.
Styling Web pages with CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are now considered the way to design Web sites if you
want to follow the latest standards and develop Web sites that are accessible, flexi-
ble, and designed to work on a wide range of devices. That’s why all the templates
featured in this book are designed with CSS.
The concept of creating styles has been around since long before the Web was born.
Desktop publishing programs, such as Adobe InDesign, and even word-processing
programs, such as Microsoft Word, have long used styles to manage the formatting
and editing of text on printed pages. Using styles in a word processor, for example,
you can create styles for common features, such as headlines, subheads, and cap-
tions. CSS offers similar benefits, as well as a few that are unique to the Web:

In print, as on the Web, styles enable you to combine a collection of for-
matting options into one style and then apply all those options at one
time. For example, you can apply Arial, bold, italic, and centered to any
selected text in your document by using a single style that you might name
frontpage-headlines.

One of the most powerful aspects of CSS is that you can make global
updates to a Web page or an entire site by simply changing a style.
Suppose that you create a style for the headlines in your site that makes
them appear large, blue, and bold. Then one fine day, you (or your clients or
friends or family members) decide that all your headlines should be red
rather than blue. If you aren’t using CSS, changing all your headlines can be
a huge undertaking — a matter of opening every Web page in your site and
making changes to the font tags around your headline text. But, if you’re
using CSS, you can simply change the headline style in your external style
sheet, and — voilà! — your headlines all turn red automatically.
You have the option of creating style sheets that apply to only one page in a
Web site, or you can create an external style sheet that can be used to
format all pages in a site. Using this approach, you can make changes across
any or all pages in a Web site by simply altering the styles in an external
style sheet.

CSS also enables you to create styles to position elements on the page. In
addition to creating styles for elements such as headlines, you can create
styles that align images to the left or right side of a page, add padding
around text or images, specify background and link colors, and create com-
plex page designs. Using CSS in this way helps you more easily create a con-
sistent look on your pages.

43
Chapter 3: Understanding Web Design

You can even create styles for different viewing formats. An example is
one style that’s applied if a page is displayed on a computer screen, another
style if the page is viewed on a cellphone, and another style for a page that’s
sent to a printer.
Using CSS for page layout
The key to understanding the way CSS works in page layout is to think in terms of
designing with a series of infinitely adjustable containers, or boxes. Indeed, this
approach to Web design is commonly referred to as the box model. Think of the box
model this way: First you use HTML tags, such as the <div> (division) tag or <p>
(paragraph) tag, to contain the content in a box. Then you use CSS to style each box,
using attributes to control the position and alignment of each box, and specify such
settings as margins, padding, and borders.
Although you can use any HTML element for page layout, the <div> tag is used most
often to create page layouts with CSS. The <div> tag simply creates a division in a
Web page. Think of the <div> tag as a generic container — designed to hold text,
images, or other content — or to make a division on the page, to separate one section
of content from another. Unlike other HTML tags, the <div> tag has no inherent for-
matting features. Unless CSS is applied to a <div> tag, it can seem invisible on a page.
Yet the tag has a powerful purpose because any content surrounded by opening and
closing <div> tags becomes an object (or a box) that can be formatted with CSS.
I used the box model to create all the templates in this book. As a result, in order to
change the size or positioning of a section of a Web page in one of the templates fea-
tured in Chapters 6-8, you need to edit the corresponding style. When you create or
edit a style that corresponds to a <div> tag ID, you can specify properties such as
alignment, border, margin, height, and width to control how the <div> tag is dis-
played on the page. In the template chapters, you find step-by-step instructions for
editing the styles that control the positioning and display of <div> tags so that you
can customize the page layouts in each template. 
Each <div> in the page templates has an ID, which corresponds to a style in the
style sheet. The ID appears in the HTML within the <div> tag brackets, so that the
browser knows which style to use to control the formatting of that <div> when it dis-
plays the page. For example, all the templates have a <div> with the ID container
that controls the overall size of the design area. If you look at the code, the <div>
looks like this <div id=”container”></div>. In the corresponding style sheet,
which you can easily access through the CSS Panel, you’ll find a style called 
#container, which controls the width and other settings for that <div>. If this all
seems a bit confusing, don’t worry too much at this stage. When you put all this
theory into practice with the templates in Chapters 6-8, it makes a lot more sense.
If you want to find out more about CSS, you can find many more lessons on how to
create, define, and edit styles in my book Dreamweaver CS3 For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing).

Chapter 4
Editing and Creating Web Graphics
F
or generations, small-business owners have taken their mar-
keting and design projects to printers, who carefully printed
photographs and used desktop-publishing programs to create
clever designs for their portfolios, brochures, and other marketing
materials.
Now an increasing number of small-business owners are doing it
themselves, thanks to powerful yet easy-to-use tools like Photoshop
Elements. If their grandparents could see these business owners
today (and maybe they do), they would be amazed by all the ways
that a computer can be used to create, edit, and alter graphical
designs.
In this chapter, you discover some of the extraordinary things you
can do with a program like Photoshop Elements. You find out how
to create images, like banners and buttons for Web pages, and then
resize, crop, and edit those images.
Perhaps most important in this book about creating Web sites, you
find step-by-step instructions for creating and optimizing graphics
that download quickly over the Web.
You can use a number of competing image-editing programs to
complete the tasks in this book. I recommend Adobe Photoshop Elements because
it’s based on the industry standard in image editing, Adobe Photoshop CS3, but is a
lot easier to use and a lot less expensive. In this book, I use Elements 5, but earlier
versions of the program also use the features 
covered in the step-by-step tasks.
Introducing Photoshop Elements
Although Photoshop Elements is a stripped-down version of its big-sister program,
Adobe Photoshop CS3, it’s still a powerful tool. The workspace, shown in Figure 4-1,
is clean and simple yet features many tools and palettes — and loads of options for
editing images and saving them for the Web. Adobe designed this program to keep
the tools around the edge of the screen and to give you the largest possible work-
space in the middle, although you can open and close palettes and move them
around the screen to suit your preferences.

Figure 4-1: Photoshop Elements displays a wide range of tools and palettes around the 
perimeter of the main workspace, where you can create and edit images.
To help you become familiar with the program before you start on the tasks, this
section introduces you to the way the workspace in Elements is organized and its
main features: the Toolbox, the Options bar, the menu, and palettes. When you first
launch Photoshop Elements, you’re greeted by a Welcome screen featuring six
choices. To access the program’s main editing features, which are covered in the fol-
lowing sections, choose Edit and Enhance Photos.
The Toolbox
One of the first things you have to get used to when you use graphics programs like
Photoshop Elements is that before you can do anything, like crop an image, you
have to select the correct tool from the Toolbox. This feature works much like the
toolbox you may have in your garage: You choose a hammer when you want to
pound a nail, or a screwdriver when you want to turn a screw.
Selecting a tool from the Toolbox is easy: Just click the icon that represents the tool
you want, such as the T icon, for adding text to an image. The tricky part is knowing
which tool to use for the job (which is similar to understanding the difference
between flat-head and Phillips-head screwdrivers). Some tools are easy to identify:
The Brush tool is for painting, for example, but others, such as the Clone Stamp tool,
may seem confusing at first.
The list of tools shown in Figure 4-2 is designed to help you appreciate all your
options in the Toolbox.

49
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Here’s a hint: Some tools are hidden underneath other tools. If a Toolbox button has
a small triangle in its lower-right corner, it means that multiple tools are accessible
from the same button. To view these alternative tools, simply click and hold the visi-
ble tool until a small fly-out menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-2: The Toolbox gives you a wide range of 
options for your image-editing arsenal.

Although you use many of these tools in the step-by-step tasks in this book to create
and edit images for the Web, I can’t possibly cover all the features in this program in
this introduction to Web graphics. (If I did, I wouldn’t be able to cover all the other
important aspects of Web design.) If you want to learn more about creating and edit-
ing images, check out Photoshop Elements For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier and
Ted Padova, or (for more-advanced techniques) the Photoshop CS3 Bible, by Laurie
Ulrich Fuller and Robert C. Fuller (both from Wiley Publishing).
The Toolbox can appear in one long list down the side of the Workspace (refer to
Figure 4-1), or you can drag it anywhere on the screen and adjust it to appear in two
columns (refer to Figure 4-2).
The Options bar
Running across the top of the Elements workspace is the Options bar, shown in
Figure 4-4. The Options bar includes drop-down lists, check boxes, and radio buttons
that can be used to adjust the settings for any selected tool. For example, when you
select the Brush tool, options are available for changing the size and shape of the
stroke that will be created when you click and drag the Brush tool over an image.
Switch to the Text tool, and the Options bar changes to feature font and size options.
Figure 4-4: The Options bar provides easy access to settings for each of the tools, 
such as the font and size options that correspond to the Text tool.
The art of Undo and Redo
With all the features, filters, and editing
options in Photoshop Elements, trial and
error is often your best strategy — and it’s
easy when you can use Undo, Redo, and
even Revert to restore any image to its last-
saved version.
If you make a change to an image and then
change your mind, just choose Edit➪Undo
to undo it. If you aren’t quite sure whether
you made an improvement, try Undo and
then Redo so that you can compare the
image before and after the effect. Photoshop
Elements includes many levels of Undo, 
so you can go back and forth over many
steps until the image is just the way you
want it.
If you’re a keyboard-shortcut fan, press
Ctrl+Z to use Undo in Windows (or Ô+Z on
the Mac); for Redo, press Ctrl+Y (or Ô+Y).

51
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
The menu bar
No program is complete without a menu bar at the top of the workspace (see
Figure 4-5). Click the menu names and you can choose from a list of commands
and editing options. If an ellipsis (...) follows the command name, the option
launches a dialog box where you can apply a variety of features. Otherwise, the
command “kicks in” automatically as soon as it’s selected.
Figure 4-5: The menu provides access to most of the features in Photoshop 
Elements, including my favorite — the Undo option.
The palettes
As in every Adobe application, the Elements workspace is filled with palettes, which
are small windows that hold formatting options and other settings. The various
palettes provide tools to help you edit and examine images. To open a palette,
choose it from the Window menu. For example, choosing Window➪Color Swatches
opens a palette with color options. Note that each palette has a More button; click-
ing More displays a list of additional commands.

52
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
A palette can remain in its column on the right side of the workspace or be dragged
into the main workspace, as shown in Figure 4-6, where I use the Special Effects
palette to apply a drop shadow to selected text in an image. To move a palette, click
it and then drag it by its tab, and then release it where you like. After you detach a
palette from the main application window, it gains its own title bar, for easier moving
and identification.
Figure 4-6: You can move a palette so that it’s closer to whatever you’re working on.

53
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Cropping an Image
Because photos on the Web are generally small, one way to ensure that
important features are visible is to crop out any material that’s not essen-
tial. The best strategy when cropping an image for the Web is to focus on
the key elements in the image. You can cut off the top, bottom, or sides, as
much or as little as you like, with the adjustable edges of the Crop tool.
In this step-by-step task, you can see how using the Crop tool to remove
the background helps focus attention on the subject.

1.
With an image open in Elements, select the Crop tool
from the Tools palette. Because you can’t retrieve
cropped parts of an image after you save and close the
image file, you likely want to work with a copy of your
original image.
2.
Click and drag within the image to define the
area you want to crop. Everything outside the
cropping box is removed when you complete
the crop.

54
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Repeat Steps 2 through 5 to make an additional crop. Choose Edit➪Undo to restore the image if you’re unhappy
with the crop.When you save the image, your changes become permanent.
4.
To complete the crop, double-click in the
middle of the selected area or click the Commit
icon (the green check mark) in the lower-right
corner of the crop box. To cancel the Crop tool
without cropping the image, click the Cancel
button (the red circle with a line through it).
3.
To increase or decrease the size of the crop-
ping box, drag the handles at the corners or
edges of the cropping area.
5.
When you complete the crop, the
areas of the image outside the crop
box are removed and the overall
size of the image is reduced propor-
tionately. The Crop tool remains
active until you select a different
tool from the Toolbox.

55
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Resizing an Image
Resizing is important for two reasons: The images must be small enough to
display well on a computer monitor, and the smaller you make the image,
the more you reduce its file size and the faster the image downloads to a
user’s computer. To enlarge or reduce the dimensions of an image, you
need to change the image size or the canvas size. Follow these steps:
Toolbox:
 Adobe Photoshop
Elements (or a similar
program)
 A digital image
Time needed:
Less than half an
hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
With an image open in Elements,
choose Image➪Resize. If you don’t
want your original image to lose
quality, make a copy of it and resize
the copy for your Web site.
2.
In the Image Size dialog box, spec-
ify a height and width for the
image. In this example, I reduce the
size of the image by 50 percent.
The Image Size dialog box can be
confusing at first because it has
multiple options for changing
image size and resolution. A simple
strategy is to use the fields in the
Pixel Dimensions area, at the top of
the dialog box. Using these options,
you can alter the height and width
of an image to a specified size in
pixels or enlarge or reduce the
image by any percentage, as you
see in this example. (Make sure
that the Scale Styles, Constrain
Proportions, and Resample Image
check boxes are all selected at the
bottom of the dialog box.)

56
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Unless you know that you want to change an image’s resolution, you can generally leave the default settings
alone. (You can find instructions for changing the resolution later in this chapter, in the sections “Optimizing
Graphics in GIF or PNG Format” and “Optimizing Photos As JPEGs.”) You generally should edit images at a rela-
tively high resolution and reduce them when you’re ready to save the final version for the Web.
4.
Click OK to resize the image. If you want to return the image to its previ-
ous size, choose Edit➪Undo. When you save the image, the changes
become permanent. Notice that the file size is reduced from 1.59 MB to
407 MB. One benefit of reducing the physical size of an image in this
way is that it can dramatically reduce the file size, which means that
the image downloads faster over the Internet.
3.
If you checked the Constrain Proportions check box at
the bottom of the dialog box in Elements, any changes
you make to the height automatically affect the width
(and vice versa), to ensure that the image proportions
remain constant even if the height or width is altered.
Creating and opening images in Elements
You can open existing images in Photoshop
Elements or create completely new images,
and you can have multiple images open at 
a time, which makes it easier to combine
images and create complex designs.
To create a new document, choose File➪
New, and in the New File dialog box, 
specify the Height, Width, Resolution, Color
Mode, and Background color. You can alter
any of the settings after an image is created.
To open an existing image, choose File➪
Open, find the image you want on your hard
drive, click to select it, and then click Open.
The image appears in a new window, ready
for you to edit.
If you try to open an image and don’t see it
in a folder on your hard drive when you
know that it should be there, change the
Files of Type field (at the bottom of the Open
dialog box) to All Formats. Every image in
the folder should now appear in the file list.
When you create a new image in Photoshop
Elements, you can specify many settings,
including size, resolution, and color.

57
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Optimizing Graphics in GIF or PNG Format
The GIF format has long been considered best for drawings, cartoons, 
and other images that have only a few colors. (As you see in the following
section, the JPEG format is ideal for photographs and other images with
millions of colors.) GIFs are also the best format to use when you want to
create images that use a transparent background, a trick that makes images
appear to “float” on a Web page. As the Web has matured, a third format,
PNG, has gained popularity. The PNG format is superior to the GIF format in
all ways except one: GIFs are better supported by older Web browsers,
especially in the area of transparency.
If your goal is to ensure that your pages display well to anyone who may
ever visit your site, GIF is the safer option. If you want your images to look
their best with the smallest file sizes, you produce better results with the
PNG format. If you’re not concerned that your visitors will be using older
Web browsers, PNG is the better choice. In the step-by-step exercise that
follows, I made the safe choice and used the GIF format, but the process is
almost exactly the same, no matter which format you choose.
When you use the PNG or GIF formats, you can reduce download time by decreasing the total number of
colors used in the image, which makes it ideal for graphics that need only a few colors in order to display
well, such as cartoons or simple logo designs. When you reduce the number of colors in a PNG or GIF
image, you’re essentially removing colors you don’t need. If you take away too many colors, however, the
change can be drastic (and look terrible); but if you limit the image to only the number of colors that are
necessary, you might not even notice the difference, and the image downloads much faster.
In this step-by-step task, you discover how best to reduce the number of colors in any image when you
save it in either the PNG or GIF format using Photoshop Elements.

Need to Know
1.
Create a new image or open an
existing image in any format in
Photoshop Elements. Because you
save a copy of an image when you
use the Save for Web option, you
don’t have to worry about altering
your original image.

2.
Choose File➪Save for Web. In the Save for Web dialog box, choose GIF from the
Optimized File Format drop-down list.
Why only 72 PPI?
When you save images for the Web, you
should save them at a resolution of 72 pixels
per inch (better known as ppi) using the
Image Size dialog box. (See the section
“Resizing an Image” earlier in this chapter.)
Most computer monitors display no more
than 72 ppi, so any number higher than that
is wasted on the Web because you’re
making your visitors download more pixels
than they can see. However, if you want to
print an image, you want all the pixels you
can get, which is why most images you see
on the Web look terrible when you try to
print them.

5.
Notice at the bottom of the Save for
Web dialog box that the original file
size appears under the preview of
the image on the left and the opti-
mized file size appears under the
preview on the right. Compare
these numbers to see how much
smaller the image is with the
number of colors reduced from 256
to 46. In this example, you can see
that by reducing the number of
colors, the image has been reduced
from 155K to 4.63K.
59
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
3.
If you’re creating an image with a transparent back-
ground, select the Transparency check box and then
specify a matte color. The matte color should match the
background color of the Web page where the image will
be displayed. Using a matching matte color helps pre-
vent “jaggies” from appearing around the edges of the
image. To change this color, select the eyedropper from
the upper-left corner of the dialog box and then click in
the Matte field to open the color palette where you can
select a color. You can also select any color in the image
by clicking the image with the eyedropper.
4.
To reduce the size of the image, lower the number of
colors by entering a number less than 256 in the Colors
field or by choosing a preset number from the Colors
drop-down list. In this example, the image is reduced
from 256 (which is the maximum number of colors a GIF
can have) to 64.

60
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
When you use the Save For Web dialog box, Elements automatically saves a copy of the image in the new
format and leaves the original image unchanged.
8.
After all the image settings are the way you want them, click OK.
In the Save dialog box, name the image and specify where you
want to save it on your hard drive. Then click Save.
6.
Reduce the number of colors fur-
ther to make the file size even
smaller — but don’t go too far. In
this example, you can see that
when the image is reduced to only
two colors, the white text with the
words Malibu, California disappear
because not enough colors remain
in the image to display the blue
background color, the red text for
Zuma Beach, and the white text.
Also notice that the red letters are
no longer smooth in the preview on
the right. That’s because even
though the image appears to only
use two colors, along the edge of
the letters, many variations on blue
and red are used to create a clean
line between the text and the back-
ground. With only two colors in the
image, that smooth edge becomes
jagged.
7.
Adjust the number of colors and other settings
until the image uses the smallest number of
colors (and therefore has the smallest file size)
without degrading the appearance of the image.
In this example, the image was reduced to 32
colors and a file size of 4.355K.

Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Optimizing Photos As JPEGs
The JPEG format is the best choice for images with many colors, such as
photographs or images that include shading or gradients. You can save any
image in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format by using the Save For Web dialog box,
but you produce the best results if you choose the best format for each
image. That’s because the best way to optimize images (make them down-
load faster over the Web) depends on how many colors appear in the
image.
Also note that even if a photograph is already in the JPEG format, you can
almost always reduce its file size (and increase its download speed) by
using the Save for Web dialog box to optimize the image, as you see in the
following steps:

4.
To reduce the size of a JPEG image, use the slider to
alter the Quality setting, or enter a number, up to 100.
Compression is measured as a percentage: The lower
the number, the higher the compression and the smaller
the file size.
3.
If the image, like the one shown in this example, is larger
than the preview area in the Save for Web dialog box,
choose the Hand tool from the upper-left corner of the
dialog box. Then click and drag to position the most
important elements in the image where you can see a
better preview. You can also change the display size of
the image by right-clicking directly over the preview
image and choosing Fit on Screen or any of the magnifi-
cation settings.
5.
Notice in the bottom of the Save
for Web dialog box that the origi-
nal file size appears under the pre-
view of the image on the left, and
the optimized file size appears
under the preview on the right. In
this example, you can see that
when the Quality field is set to 75,
the image is reduced from 1.36 MB
to 130.2K.

7.
Keep a close eye on the preview
screen as you adjust the Quality
option. If you reduce the quality
too far, you degrade the image’s
appearance noticeably.
6.
Alter the Quality setting until the
image uses the greatest amount of
compression (the greater the com-
pression, the lower the number in
the Quality field), without degrad-
ing the appearance of the image
too much. In this example, the
Quality setting was reduced to 50,
to achieve a file size of 69.75K, less
than half the file size when the
Quality setting was 75.
63

8.
After all the image settings are the way you want them, click OK, and in the Save
dialog box, give the image a new name and specify where you want to save it on your
hard drive. Then click Save to save a new version of the JPEG with the specified set-
tings and preserve the original unchanged.
Enlarging and reducing image display
As you’re working on images in Photoshop
Elements, it’s often helpful to enlarge or
reduce the display size of the image so that
you can view more of it on the screen or to
zoom in on details you want to edit. You can
use the Zoom tool to increase or decrease
the size at which the image appears on your
screen.
First, click to select the Zoom tool from the
Toolbox, and then click anywhere on the
image to increase its display size. Alt+click
(in Windows) or Option+click (on the Mac) to
decrease the display size. Here’s a tip: By
changing the display size, you can figure out
how much you may need to change the
actual size of your image to make it appear
the way you want on a computer screen. To
do so, use the Zoom tool to size the image
the way you want in your Web page, and
then notice the percentage (displayed at the
top of the screen, next to the filename). Then
you know the number you need to enter in
the Size field in the Image Size dialog box
when you resize it using a percentage.
To redisplay the image in its true size on
your monitor, double-click the Zoom tool.

Combining Photos and Text in a New Image
Creating a new image with photos and text is almost as easy as editing an
existing image, such as the banners and buttons included in the templates in
this book.
In general, I find that the best method is to create a new image in Photoshop
Elements and then copy in any photos or other graphics that I want to use.
With the images in place, you can easily add text to pull it all together. Just
follow these steps to create your own banners and buttons:
1.
In Photoshop Elements, choose File➪New to
create a new image and specify the size, resolu-
tion, and background color. In this task, I’m cre-
ating an image that’s 500 pixels wide by 380
pixels high with a resolution of 72 ppi, in RGB
color with a white background.
2.
If the Layers palette isn’t already
open on the side of the workspace,
choose Window➪Layers to open
the Layers palette. (It must be open
if you want to keep track of the
layers as they’re automatically cre-
ated when you copy in images or
add text to the image.)

4.
When you’re working with multiple
images in Photoshop Elements, you
may want to open the Photo Bin, at
the bottom of the workspace: If it
isn’t already open, choose Window➪
Open the Photo Bin. You can select
any open image by clicking its
thumbnail image.
3.
Open any image or images that you
want to add to the new file by
choosing File➪Open and selecting
the image from your hard drive.
You can open images in any of the
many formats supported by
Photoshop Elements, including
JPEG, GIF, TIF, and PSD.
5.
To copy an open image into the new file, first
click to select the Move tool from the upper-left
corner of the Toolbox.

66

7.
With the image selected, choose File➪Copy or press 
the key combination Ctrl+C (on Windows) or Ô+C 
(on the Mac).
6.
Click to select the image to make it active and
then choose Select➪All.
8.
Here’s the tricky part: You need to select the file
where you want to add the image before you
paste it. If the Photo Bin is open at the bottom
of the workspace, you can select it there. You
can also select any image that’s visible in the
workspace by clicking it.

67
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
11. To add and position additional
images, repeat Steps 6 through 10.
Notice in this example that the
Layers palette displays three 
layers — the white background
layer and a separate layer for each
of the photos that have been
pasted into the image. As I added
those images, Photoshop Elements
added the layers automatically.
9.
Choose File➪Paste, or use the key combinations Ctrl+V
(on Windows) or Ô+V (on the Mac).
10. To position the pasted image, click to select it
and then drag it to the place where you want it
to appear in the new image. For more-precise
positioning, use the arrow keys — you can
adjust a selected layer pixel-by-pixel in any
direction. You can resize an image with the
Move tool by clicking and dragging any corner
to adjust the height and width.

68
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
14. You can also use the Text tool options at the top
of the workspace to change the font size, face,
and alignment.
13. When you select the Text tool, a
new collection of options appears
at the top of the workspace. There,
you can change such text options
as the color (shown in this figure),
by clicking the color well to open
the color selection palette and then
clicking any color in the palette.
Use the scroll bar, to the right of
the palette window, to display more
colors.
12. To add text to an image (whether or not it
already has multiple layers, like this one does),
you must first select the Text tool from the
Toolbox.

17. When you add text, Photoshop automatically
places it on a new layer, which appears in the
Layers palette. To move or edit a layer, you
must first select the Move tool from the
Toolbox. Photoshop Elements automatically
selects a layer when you click it.
69
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
16. You can also use the text options at the top of
the workspace to edit the text after you type it.
To do so, simply select the text you want to
change, and then choose any of the formatting
options to alter the color, font, size, or other
settings. To edit the words, click to select the
text and then delete or type to replace it.
15. To add text to the image, click to place your
cursor where you want it and then type. You
can add as much text as you want to an image
and press the Enter (or Return) key to add line
breaks.
Turning layers on and off or rearranging them
Sometimes when you’re working on an
image with many layers, it’s handy to turn
them on and off so that you can experiment
with different combinations or clear the
workspace while you work on a detail. By
clicking the small eye icon to the left of any
layer, you can make the layer invisible in the
workspace. Don’t worry — you can turn the
layer back on by simply clicking in the same
field again to make the eye icon reappear.
That’s the beauty of this feature: Now you
see it, now you don’t.
You can also rearrange the order of layers in
the Layers palette, which is how you can
control which layer is on top in the image.
To change the stacking order, click to drag
the layer up or down in the Layers palette.
The higher the layer is in the palette, the
higher its position in the stacking order in
the file.

70
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
20. You can continue to add text layers
and images, and edit and adjust
them, forever by repeating this set
of steps. One of the best ways to
become comfortable with using
Photoshop Elements is to take
some time to experiment with com-
bining and rearranging text and
images in multiple layers.
19. To make layers even easier to identify, you
can change the name of a layer: Right-click
the layer and choose Rename Layer to open
the Layer Properties dialog box window,
where you can type a new name.
18. If a layer isn’t visible in the workspace, you can
select it from the Layers palette by clicking the
corresponding layer. Notice that Photoshop
Elements displays a preview of the contents of
each layer to make it easy to identify the layer
you want to select.

71
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Editing Images with Multiple Layers
One of the most-confusing features in a program like Photoshop Elements
is the way it divides different parts of an image into layers. Essentially,
layers enable Photoshop Elements to separate one image into multiple sec-
tions, which can be edited independently. That’s what makes it possible for
you to do things like edit text without affecting a photo underneath it or
move separate photos around a photo montage independently until you
place them just the way you want.
Without layers, text would become “stuck” on a photo in a banner, like the
one shown in this task, and you couldn’t edit the text again after you added
it to the image. This feature is especially useful for customizing the ban-
ners, buttons, and other graphic elements included in the templates used
in this book.
When you add text, photos, or other elements to a new or existing file,
Photoshop Elements automatically creates a new layer for each addition.
Those layers can then be edited independently. Before you can edit text or
an image containing a layer, however, you have to select the corresponding
layer. That’s where the Layers palette come in, as you see in this task.

6.
After you make changes to the text, choose
File➪Save As and give the image a new name.
This saves the changes without altering the
original image.
3.
In the Toolbox, select the tool that you need in
order to edit the contents of the layer. In this
example, I selected the Text tool so that I can
edit the words.
5.
To edit text in another layer, you
must again select the correspon-
ding layer in the Layers palette. In
this example, I selected the layer
that contains the text in the lower-
right corner of the banner image.
Because I had already selected the
Text tool, once the Text tool was
selected, I simply selected the text
I wanted to edit and replaced it by
typing new text.
4.
Use the selected tool to alter the selected
image. In this example, I double-clicked the
name LaFontaine to select it and then typed
the name Warner in its place.

73
Chapter 4: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Designing with Special Effects
Photoshop Elements includes a wide collection of special effects, including
filters, layer styles, and photo effects. You can use these options to add
drop shadows to images or text, create beveled edges, and even add artis-
tic flourishes, like the painterly effects included in the Artistic collection,
as shown in this task.
1.
In Photoshop Elements, choose
File➪New to create a new image or
File➪Open to open an existing one.
Then open the Artwork and Effects
palette by either clicking the small
arrow next to the palette title or
choosing Window➪Artwork and
Effects.
2.
Keep the Layers palette open so that you can make sure that
you’re applying effects to the correct layer. (Choose Window➪
Layers to open the palette.) By clicking and dragging the top of
any palette, you can expand or reduce its height so that it takes
up more or less room on the side of the workspace.

To apply a filter or another effect,
click to select the layer you want to
apply it to and then double-click
the icon in the Layers palette. In
this example, I selected the layer
with the photo and double-clicked
the Cutout filter to open the Cutout
filter dialog box. Each of the artistic
filters includes a dialog box like this
one, where you can adjust the
filter’s effects. Notice, on the left
side of this dialog box, a preview of
the image, where you can see how
the filter will affect the image.
3.
The Artwork and Effects palette has many options. You
can switch among the different collections by clicking
the category icons across the top of the palette and
using the drop-down lists to select collections within
each category, such as the many filter options shown
here.

6.
To apply text filters, such as the drop shadow,
click the T icon at the top of the Special Effects
palette to open the text effects options. Then
click to select the layer. In this example, I
selected the text layer with the words Beach
Walks. With the text layer selected, double-
click any text option and it’s automatically
applied to the text.
5.
Click OK to apply the filter to the
image and close the dialog box.
Choose Edit➪Undo to remove the
filter. To adjust the filter settings,
double-click the filter icon in the
Special Effects palette to reopen the
dialog box.
7.
To remove a text filter, choose Edit➪Undo. To
apply another filter, double-click the Text tool.
In this example, I removed the drop shadow
and applied a Beveled filter instead. You can
apply multiple filters to the same element to
create more-complex effects.
Mastering photo editing requires lots of practice, and the best way to get it down pat is to experiment.
Especially when you’re working with advanced features, like filters and special effects, trial and error is a won-
derful strategy.Applying different filters to text and images just to see what they do is a helpful way to find out
what you can do with all these cool features.

I
n the ten-plus years that I’ve been writing about Web design, I’ve
seen many changes — from the early days when you could create
only simple pages with HTML 1.0 (before Web design programs like
Dreamweaver even existed) to the elaborate designs you can create
now using XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, multimedia, and more.
If you’re not sure what those acronyms mean, don’t worry. I remember
what it was like to figure out all this stuff, too, so I designed this book
to introduce you to the basic concepts of Web design while keeping
things as simple as possible.
If you’re eager to create a Web site as quickly as you can, feel free to
jump ahead to Chapters 6, 7, or 8, where you find instructions for cus-
tomizing the ready-to-use templates that come with this book. Before
you do, I suggest that you at least skim through this chapter, which is
designed to introduce you to Dreamweaver and to show you how to use
this popular design program for some common tasks, such as customiz-
ing CSS layouts, creating CSS styles, inserting images, and setting links.
The high-end features in Dreamweaver make it the preferred choice for professional
Web designers, and its easy-to-use graphical interface makes it popular among
novices and hobbyists. You should know that in my effort to keep things simple in
this book, I cover only a small portion of the features in this complex program. You
can learn lots more about Dreamweaver in my book Dreamweaver CS3 For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing).
At the beginning of this chapter, you find detailed instructions for one of the most
important features in Dreamweaver: the site Definition dialog box. Defining a site in
Dreamweaver is important whether you use one of the templates featured later in
this book or create your own, custom design using the instructions in the rest of this
chapter.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Setting Up a New or Existing Site
As a general rule when you create a Web site, you first create all the pages on your
computer’s hard drive, where you can preview your pages in a Web browser and test
the site before it’s visible on the Internet. Then, when the site is ready, you transfer
the files to your Web server, a computer with a permanent connection to the Internet
that uses special software to communicate with Web browsers, such as Internet
Explorer and Firefox.
Because all the files you work with on your hard drive must be in the same relative
location on the Web server, you need to store all your site’s resources in one folder
on your hard drive and identify that folder as the local root folder in Dreamweaver.
As you progress through the site-definition process in the following task, you can
create a new folder on your hard drive and designate it as your local root folder, or
you can identify an existing folder if you’re updating or redesigning a site. The loca-
tion where you save the local root folder on your hard drive doesn’t matter, as long
as you identify it in Dreamweaver. Just be aware that if you move the local root
folder, you have to go through the site setup process again so Dreamweaver knows
where it is.
When you’re ready to publish a completed site, you transfer it to your Web server by
using the Dreamweaver built-in File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) features. You find
detailed instructions for publishing a Web site in Chapter 9.
Working with an existing Web site
If you’re working on redesigning or editing a
site that already exists, your first challenge
is to get a copy of the site on your hard
drive. Fortunately, Dreamweaver can help
you download an existing site off a Web
server with the same features you use to
publish a site. All you need is the login infor-
mation, username, and password to access
the Web server.
To download an existing site, first complete
the site setup process featured at the begin-
ning of this chapter and then create a new,
blank folder where you store all files in the
Web site. Then follow the instructions in the
section “Setting Up FTP in Dreamweaver”
in Chapter 9 to connect Dreamweaver with
your server. After you establish a connec-
tion, just click the Get button (also shown in
Chapter 9) to download all files in the exist-
ing site.
After you have your site on your hard 
drive, you can edit and add pages using
Dreamweaver, even if your site was created
in another Web design program. However,
if you’re doing a major redesign, you might
be better off to start from scratch, by creat-
ing a new site in Dreamweaver and then
copying the existing text, images, and other
materials into the new pages.

Defining a Web Site in Dreamweaver
If the site-definition process seems a little confusing at first, don’t
worry; it’s a quick, relatively painless process and you have to do it
only once for each site. Just trust me — don’t skip this preliminary step.
Whether you’re creating a new site or working on an existing site, the
following steps walk you through the process of defining a local root
folder for your Web site.

5.
Click the Browse icon next to the Local Root
Folder text box to locate the folder on your hard
drive that you want to serve as the main folder
for all files in your Web site. (Hint: The Browse
icon in Dreamweaver always looks like a small,
yellow file folder and is usually located at the
right side of a text field.) If you’re setting up a
new site, create a new folder on your hard drive
using the Create New Folder icon in the Choose
Local Folder dialog box, and then select that
folder as the local root folder. If you’re setting up
an existing Web site, select the folder that con-
tains the files for that site to designate it as the
Local Root Folder.
4.
In the Site Name text box, type a name for your
site. You can call your site whatever you like;
this name is used only to help you keep track of
your sites. Many people work on more than one
site in Dreamweaver, and this feature enables
you to keep track of them by name. The name
you enter here appears in the drop-down list in
the Files panel and in the Manage Sites dialog
box. You use this list to select the site you want
to work on when you open Dreamweaver. In
this example, I named the new site Designs for
Dancing.
3.
In the Category box on the left, make sure that the Local
Info category is selected. This category should be open
by default when you click the Advanced tab.

81
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
6.
Click the Browse icon next to the Default Images
folder field and select the images folder in an
existing Web site. If you’re creating a new site,
create a new folder inside your local root folder,
name it images, and select it. Although you
don’t have to identify an images folder, it has
some advantages. For example, if you ever
insert an image that isn’t located in your local
root folder, Dreamweaver copies it into the
images folder you identify during the site-setup
process. If you create an images folder,
Dreamweaver copies images into the main
folder. (You can also store images in other fold-
ers within your local root folder.)
8.
In the HTTP Address text box, type the URL of
your Web site. The HTTP address is the URL, or
Web address, that your site will have when it’s
published on a Web server (see Chapter 2). If
you don’t yet know the Web address for your
site or you don’t plan to publish it on a Web
server, you can leave this box blank. If you do
fill it in, include http:// at the beginning and /
at the end.
7.
For the Links Relative To radio buttons, leave the
Document option selected unless you know that you
want your links to be set up relative to the root level of
your site. This setting controls how the path is set in
links. If you’re working on a site with other developers
and you’re not sure, check with your colleagues. If
you’re working alone on your own site, Links Relative to
Document is the simplest option and should already be
selected because it’s the default option in
Dreamweaver.
9.
Select the Use Case-Sensitive Link Checking
check box. Unless you know for sure that you
don’t have to worry about the case of your file-
names, selecting this box makes Dreamweaver
ensure that the case matches for all your site’s
links (which many Web-hosting services
require).
10. Select the Enable Cache option. Dreamweaver
creates a local cache of your site to quickly ref-
erence the location of files in your site. The
local cache speeds up many site-management
features of the program and takes only a few
seconds to create.

82
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
12. If you work on more than one site in Dreamweaver, be
sure to define each site the first time you work on it.
After that, you can easily switch among defined sites by
selecting the one you want to work on in the Files
panel. You can define as many sites as you like in
Dreamweaver. To load a different site into the Files
panel, click the drop-down arrow next to the site name
and choose the name of the site you want to display. In
this figure, you can see that I’m opening the site named
The Chocolate Game by selecting it from a long list of
defined sites. You can see, toward the top of this list,
the Designs for Dancing site.
11. Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box and save
your settings. If the folder you selected as your local
site folder already contains files or subfolders, they’re
automatically cached and any files or folders in your
site are displayed in the Files panel. In this example,
because I’m creating a new site, only the images sub-
folder is displayed. If you haven’t checked the Enable
Cache option, a message box appears, asking whether
you want to create a cache for the site. Doing so is 
good practice because it helps Dreamweaver work 
more efficiently.

83
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
You can make changes and additions to a site by choosing Site➪Manage Sites, selecting the site name in the
Manage Sites dialog box, and then clicking the Edit button.The defined site then opens in the Site Definition
dialog box, where you can make changes to any setting, such as selecting a different images folder or local root
folder. Remember that if you move the local root folder on your hard drive, you need to edit the site definition to
identify the new folder location.
Naming Web pages
Filenames are especially important in Web
sites because they’re included in the HTML
code when you set links. Over the years, I
have received more e-mail messages from
panicked Web designers because of broken
links caused by filename conflicts than
almost any other issue. Because these prob-
lems usually don’t occur until after a Web
site is published on a server, they can be
especially confusing and difficult to under-
stand. Following a few simple pointers can
help you avoid or troubleshoot filename-
related problems:
 When you save Web pages, images, and
other files for your site, the basic rule is
this: Don’t use blank spaces or special
characters in a filename. For example,
don’t name a Web page with an apostro-
phe, such as cat’s page.html. If you
want to separate words, you can use the
underscore (_) or the hyphen (-). For
example, cat-page.html is an accept-
able filename. Numbers are okay in
most cases, and capital letters don’t gen-
erally matter, as long as the filename and
the code in the link match.
The potentially misleading point is that
links with spaces and special characters
work just fine when you test pages on a
Mac or PC, but the software used on
many of the Web servers on the Internet
don’t accept spaces or special characters
in links. Thus, links that don’t follow
these rules can be broken when you
publish the site to a Web server.
 All files in a Web site must also include
an extension at the end of the filename,
to identify the file type (such as .html
for HTML files or .jpg for JPEG images).
Dreamweaver automatically adds the
.html file extension to the end of HTML
files, but you may need to change your
Windows settings if you want to be able
to see the extension. Similarly, programs
like Photoshop automatically add the
extension on Windows computers; if
you’re using a Macintosh, you may need
to add the extensions manually.
 Another confusing rule, and one of the
most important, is that the main page
(or front page) of your Web site must be
named index.html or default.html,
depending on your Web server. That’s
because most Web servers are set up to
serve the index.html page first. To
ensure that you use the correct name,
check with your service provider or
system administrator. (Some servers are
set up to handle home.html, or
default.asp for dynamic sites, but
most commercial service providers
serve index.html before any other
page in any folder in a site.) The rest of
the pages in your site can be named any-
thing you like, as long as they don’t
include spaces or special characters
(except for the dash or underscore).

84
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Creating New Pages in Dreamweaver
In this task, I show you how you can use Dreamweaver’s new collection of
layouts to create a variety of one-, two-, and three-columned designs using
CSS so that you can create your own custom page designs. In the tasks that
follow later in the chapter, you find out how to turn a page design into a
template you can use to easily create similar pages for a Web site with sec-
tions that can be updated automatically. You also find out how to add
common features, such as images, text, links, and more.
Whether you’re creating a simple design or a complex one, it’s almost
always easier to start with one of the prestyled Dreamweaver layouts. By
using one of these layouts, you start with not only some of the basics done
for you but also a design that’s optimized for a wide variety of Web
browsers — no simple task when you consider that browsers don’t always
support CSS consistently.
These Dreamweaver layouts aren’t much to look at when you first open
them. They’re intentionally designed with a basic gray color scheme —
fortunately color styles are some of the easiest to alter in CSS. If you’re new
to CSS, altering one of these layouts may seem confusing at first, but it’s
similar to editing the other templates featured in this book and certainly
easier than starting from scratch. The following lesson is designed to help
you appreciate how easy it is to create your own site design with the many
predesigned layouts included in Dreamweaver CS3.
Before you begin creating new pages, make sure that you completed the
site-setup process covered in the previous task in this chapter.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
To create a new page, choose File➪New. In the
New Document dialog box, choose Blank Page
from the options on the far left (as I’ve done
here). Under the Page Type column, you can
now select from many different file types,
including HTML, XML, and PHP. To create a
simple Web page, like the one I use throughout
this book, choose HTML.
A fixed layout is generally an easier option to start with, but liquid designs have advantages because they’re more
flexible.You can find a longer description of the layout types in the Dreamweaver Help files, but essentially here are
the options: Liquid layouts are designed to expand and contract depending on the size of the browser window;
fixed layouts are centered within the browser and set to a width of 780 pixels; elastic layouts use the ems meas-
urement to adapt to different text sizes and other variations in display; and hybrid layouts use a mix of options.

85
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
3.
When you create a layout, you can choose to create
internal styles or an external style sheet. I recommend
that you create an external style sheet because you can
then use the same styles across multiple pages. To
create an external style sheet as you create a new page
like this, use the drop-down menu next to Layout CSS:
Select Create New File and then click the Create button.
2.
When HTML is selected in the New dialog box,
a list of CSS layouts appears in the Layout
Column. In the close-up view of this dialog box,
shown in this figure, you can see that I selected
a design that creates a two-column fixed layout
with a header and footer.
4.
In the Save Style Sheet File As dialog box, give
the style sheet a name. You can use the default
name that Dreamweaver suggests or change the
name to something that has more meaning to
you. Just be sure not to use any spaces or spe-
cial characters in the name, and keep the .css
extension. In this example, I named the style
sheet designs.css. Click Save to save the
style sheet and attach it to the new page at the
same time.

86
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
7.
By following the common practice of using Div tags to
“contain” elements on a page and styles, to describe how
they should be displayed, Dreamweaver includes a Div
identified as container in every layout. The container
controls the overall width of the design area; to change
the width of your design, you need to change the corre-
sponding style. To do so, double-click the style named
.twoColFixLtHdr #container to open it in the CSS
Rules Definition dialog box. (The Div is the foundation of
the box model, which I explain in Chapter 3.)
6.
All Dreamweaver layouts include a collection of corre-
sponding styles. As a result, to edit any of the elements in
this layout, you must edit the corresponding style. First,
open the CSS Styles panel (if it’s not already open) by
choosing Window➪CSS Styles, and then click the plus (+)
sign next to designs.css (or whatever you named your
external style sheet) to open it. Dreamweaver displays all
styles that correspond with this page. (Tip: Make sure
that the All button is selected at the top of the CSS panel
to display all styles.)
5.
Get into the (excellent) habit of saving a new
page as soon as it’s created. Choose File➪Save
and give the file a name. Again, don’t use any
spaces or special characters in the filename,
and be sure to retain the .html extension. I
named this file designs.html. As soon as you
save the file, it’s also good practice to add a
title right away by replacing the words Untitled
Page with your own title at the top of the work-
space, as you see in this figure.

87
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
8.
In the CSS Rules Definition dialog box, choose
the Box Category from the left and then use
the width field to change the width as desired.
In this case, I’m changing the width from 780
pixels to 790 by replacing the number in the
Width field. Limiting the width of your page to
790 pixels is good practice if you want your
page to display well in an 800-by-600 resolu-
tion monitor. After you make any changes you
want, click Apply to preview the results and
then click OK to close the dialog box.
9.
The Header area of the page can be changed by
simply typing a new header to replace the text
that says Header. To change the color or other
style options for the header, double-click the
style named .twoColFixLtHdr #header to
open it in the CSS Rules Definition dialog box.
Click to select the Background category, and
use the color well to change the background
color. Choose the Type category to access font,
size, and other text options. Click Apply to see
how the settings look, and then click OK to save
them and close the dialog box. To find out more
about using the HTML heading tags, see the
sidebar “Combining HTML headings and CSS.”
Dreamweaver includes a body class for each of these layouts and includes it in the name of each style. In this
case, the body class is twoColFixLtHdr.You can remove the body class by deleting .twoColFixLtHdr
from the front of each style name, but if you do so, you must also delete it from the body tag in the HTML code.
To do so, first click the Split View button at the top of the workspace to open the HTML code, and then search for
the body tag and delete class=”twoColFixLtHdr”.Although removing the class style is optional, it sim-
plifies the rest of the style names by making them all shorter, which many designers find easier when working
with style sheets.To save you from having to find the body tag in the HTML code, I leave the longer style names
the way Dreamweaver creates them.

88
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
11. Notice that the banner didn’t line up properly
when I inserted it into the header in this layout.
That’s because the header is styled for text and
includes padding in addition to an H1 tag. To
make the banner fit in the header properly, you
need to remove the extra space. First, double-
click the style named .twoColFixLtHdr
#header in the CSS panel. Then select the Box
category, and change to 0 the number of
padding pixels you find in the Right and Left
fields under Padding.
10. For the dressmaker’s design featured in this 
task, I replaced the word Header with a graphic
by simply deleting the text and choosing
Insert➪Image to select my banner image. If you
insert a graphic that’s not in your local root
folder, Dreamweaver automatically copies 
it into your images folder. Unless you have
Accessibility Attributes turned off in the
Dreamweaver preferences, you’re also prompted
to enter alternate text. Alternate text, which is 
displayed if an image isn’t visible, provides a
description of the image for visitors who are visu-
ally impaired and use special browsers that
“read” Web pages aloud. Type a description of
your image in the Alternate text field in the Image
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box.
Alternatively, you can click to select any image
and type a description into the Alt field in the
Property inspector.
12. The extra space at the top and bottom of the
banner is caused by the H1 tag. If you deleted
this when you deleted the text, you won’t have
this problem, but it’s easy to leave the H1 tag
behind. Here’s a good way to remove any
unwanted HTML formatting. First, click to place
your cursor in the Header area. (It doesn’t
matter whether you select the image.) Then in
the tag selector at the bottom of the work-
space, right-click the H1 tag and choose
Remove Tag.

14. You can also edit styles by using the CSS Styles Property
pane, which appears just below the CSS panel. For
example, in this figure, I selected the style #sidebar1,
and I’m changing the width to 220 pixels by editing the
number of pixels specified in the Width field. By default,
only style settings that have been defined are displayed
in the Property pane.
89
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
13. You can also change the font or color of any or
all text on a page by changing the corresponding
styles. If you aren’t familiar with HTML, you may
not guess that to change the font style for the
entire page, you need to alter the Body style.
That’s because the <body> tag controls page-
wide settings, like font face and link styles. You
can use multiple fonts on a page by changing
the font style for a specific section of text, but to
change the default font for the entire page,
double-click to select the <body> tag in the CSS
panel, choose the Type category and use the
drop-down list in the Font field to select a font
collection. 
15. If you want change the width of a column in one of the
Dreamweaver CSS layouts, you need to alter the styles
for both columns. One complexity of most Dreamweaver
layouts is that the style for the sidebar Div has a speci-
fied width, but the Div identified as mainContent uses
a Margin style to control its positioning in relationship
to the sidebar. As a result, if you change the width of the
left sidebar, which I did in the previous step, you need to
change the margin setting in the #mainContent style
by the same amount. In this figure, I’m changing the
margin of the #mainContent to 270 pixels by using the
CSS Properties pane. I set the margin to a higher number
than the width of the sidebar to leave a gutter between
the two columns.

90
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
17. Although the boundaries of Div tags don’t dis-
play in a browser unless you include a style to
create a border, by default Dreamweaver CS3
displays a thin line around Divs to aid you in
your design work. You can turn these, and
other invisible elements, on and off by clicking
on the Visual Aids icon at the top of the work-
space and selecting the options you want to
display. You can hide all visual elements or
choose to display any subset of them by select-
ing them from the drop-down list.
16. To change or remove a background color, such
as the gray color in the sidebar, double-click
the style name in the CSS Styles panel to open
it in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box. To
change the color, choose the Background cate-
gory and then click the color well in the
Background Color field. To remove a color,
simply delete the contents of the Background
Color field. If no color is specified, the color of
the page background or surrounding container
is used. In this case, the sidebar changes to
white when I delete the color code.
For more information on font collections, see the later sidebar “Why so many fonts?” If the body tag isn’t
already defined with a style, you might find it easier to use the Page Properties dialog box, described in the sec-
tion “Changing Page-Wide Settings with Page Properties,” later in this chapter.
You can adjust the margins and padding around images, Div tags, and other elements to control spacing and
positioning.The simplest way to understand padding and margins is to remember this statement: Padding adds
space to the inside of an element, and margins add space to the outside.The same statement is true whether
the element is a Div tag, an image, a table cell, or anything else. If you want more space around a photo, for
example, add margin space. If you want a gap between the edge of a Div tag and its contents, add padding.
Here’s an advanced tip:When you add padding, you increase the overall size of the element. For example, a Div
that is 200 pixels wide and has 10 pixels of padding on each side expands to fill 220 pixels of space in the
design.When you click an element, such as the sidebar Div in this task, Dreamweaver displays a series of
slanted lines around the edge of the Div that represent the amount of margin or padding.

91
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
Combining HTML headings and CSS
One of the most common text formatting
options in HTML is the heading style. In
HTML, you gain many advantages to using
the heading styles (H1, H2, and so on) to
style text that serves as titles or headlines.
That’s because heading styles are designed
to be displayed in relative sizes no matter
which text size users set in their Web
browsers. When you use headings, H1 is the
largest, H2 is the next largest, and so on,
decreasing in size through H6. Another ben-
efit to using headings is that search engines
generally give priority to keywords that are
formatted with the H1 or H2 tags, because
the use of a heading tag implies that the text
has greater importance on a page.
Because you can redefine any HTML tag
with CSS, you can alter the display of head-
ing tags while still enjoying these benefits.
You can also combine styles so that text for-
matted with an H1 tag can appear one way
when placed within the sidebar of a page
and appear another way when placed within
the main content area. That’s why many 
CSS layouts that come with Dreamweaver
include styles like #header H1 — because
a style with that name redefines text that’s
formatted with the H1 tag only if it appears
within a Div that has the ID “header.” (To see
an example, check out the style named
.twoColFixLTHdr #header h1 in the
two-column layout used in the section
“Creating New Pages in Dreamweaver,” ear-
lier in this chapter.)
You can apply Heading tags to text by
selecting any text on a page and then using
the drop-down list in the Property inspector
at the bottom of the screen to select a
Heading option, as you see in this figure. To
create a style for a Heading tag, follow the
steps in the “Defining New Styles in
Dreamweaver” task.

92
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Defining New Styles in Dreamweaver
Whether you create a new, blank page in Dreamweaver or start with one of
the Dreamweaver CSS layouts, as described in the previous task, you can
create your own styles to format text, images, and other elements in your
pages.
As you move through the steps to create a new style in Dreamweaver, you
might be surprised by the number of options in the numerous panels and
dialog boxes available for creating CSS. As you explore the possibilities,
remember that you can leave attributes unspecified if you don’t want to
use them and that you can always go back and edit styles after you create
them.
To define a new style, either create a new document or open an existing
HTML file and follow these steps:
1.
Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪New.
2.
In the New CSS Rule dialog box, choose a selec-
tor type. In this example, I’m creating a class
style. In the Name field, type a name. Because
class styles must begin with a period (.), I named
this style .imagecaption. For a description of
the three selector options, and the naming con-
ventions that correspond with each one, see the
nearby sidebar “Understanding CSS selectors.”

In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, choose
a category on the left. For this example, 
I chose the Type category to specify font
options. As you can see in this figure, I chose
the Arial, Helvetica, sans serif font collection
and set the size to Small and the weight to
Bold. (See the upcoming sidebar “Why so
many fonts?” for more information about
font collections.) Click OK to save the style
and close the dialog box.
3.
In the Define In area, select the This Document
Only radio button to create an internal style
sheet. In this example, I’m adding my new style
to an external style sheet that’s already
attached to my page (the design.css style I
created in the previous task). To do that, click to
select the Define In radio button and choose the
name of the style sheet from the drop-down list.
You can also choose to create a new external
style sheet as you create a new style, by choos-
ing the New Style Sheet File option from the
drop-down list and then entering a name in the
Save Style Sheet File As dialog box. Click OK to
continue.
5.
The new style appears at the bottom of the CSS Styles
panel. You can change the order of styles by clicking to
select a style name and dragging it to another position
in the panel.

94
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
6.
To apply a new class style, like the one I created in this
task, select a section of text in a Web page and then use
the Style drop-down list to select and apply the style.
For more information on how to apply other kinds of
styles, see the nearby sidebar, “Understanding CSS
selectors.”
Understanding CSS selectors
When you create a new style, you first spec-
ify the selector, the type of style you’re cre-
ating. When you create a new style in
Dreamweaver, you can choose from these
selectors:
 Class: Creates a class style that can be
applied to any element on a page and
can be used multiple times on the same
page. You can name a class style any-
thing you like, as long as you don’t use
spaces or punctuation. Class style
names must begin with a period (.). If
you select the Class option and neglect
to enter a period at the beginning of the
name, Dreamweaver adds one for you.
After a class style is created, it’s available
from the Class drop-down list in the
Property inspector. To apply a class style,
select any section of text, an image, or
another element on a page, and then use
the drop-down menu in the Class or
Style field in the Property inspector to
apply the style.
 Tag: Redefines an existing HTML tag. In
this case, you’re creating a new style that
will override the existing rules for the
selected tag or add formatting to an
existing tag. When you alter an existing
tag, you change the way all instances of
that HTML tag appear throughout your
page, unless you use the Advanced
option to redefine a tag within another
style. Tag styles are automatically
applied when a tag is applied. For exam-
ple, if you redefine the style for the H1
heading tag, the style is applied when-
ever you format text with the Heading
tag.
 Advanced: Creates an ID style, a contex-
tual style, or any other advanced style
option. ID styles must begin with a
pound sign (#) and can be used only
once per page. It’s common practice in
CSS layouts to use ID styles to control
the appearance of Div tags. Contextual
styles specify the display of one style
within the context of another. For exam-
ple, #sidebar h1 defines a style for the
heading tag only when it appears within
a Div or other element that has the ID
sidebar.
You find out more about creating and using
CSS styles in my book Dreamweaver CS3
For Dummies, (Wiley Publishing).

Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
Creating and Using Templates
After you’ve spent a great deal of time creating a page design in
Dreamweaver, you might be pleased to know that you can turn your
designs into a template that you can use to create other pages more
quickly for your site. When you save a file as a Dynamic Web Template
in Dreamweaver, it becomes available from the New File dialog box,
which makes it easy to use to create new files. But the greatest time-
saving benefit of Dynamic Web Templates becomes evident when you
want to make changes to a design after you’ve used it to create numer-
ous pages, because you can use templates to make global updates
across many pages at once.
In most of the templates included with this book, I used the
Dreamweaver Dynamic Web Template features. Reading through this
task not only shows you how to create your own templates but also
helps you better understand how to use and edit the templates
included in the rest of this book.
In this task, you learn how to save any page as a template, use the tem-
plate to create new pages, and then edit the template to make global
updates to those pages.

1.
You can turn any page in Dreamweaver into a template
by using the Save As Template option. In this task, I
build on what I did in the earlier task in this chapter, by
turning into a template the page I created from a
Dreamweaver layout. To begin, open a Web page in
Dreamweaver and choose File➪Save As Template.

96
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
3.
When you create a Dynamic Web Template,
Dreamweaver automatically adds the .dwt extension.
In this case, my file is named designs.dwt. As you can
see in the Files panel shown in this figure, Dreamweaver
automatically stores the new template in a folder
named Templates. If you don’t already have a
Templates folder in your local root folder, Dreamweaver
creates one for you when you save your first template.
2.
In the Save as Template dialog box, make sure
that the site you’re working on is displayed in
the Site field. (This should happen automati-
cally if you completed the site-definition
process; if you haven’t, make sure to do so by
following the steps in the first task in this chap-
ter.) You can name the template anything you
like, as long as you don’t use spaces or punctua-
tion. When you’re prompted by with the Update
Links dialog box, choose Yes to preserve any
links to pages or images in the file.
4.
Before you use your template to create other pages, you
need to create Editable regions in the template. Editable
regions are areas of the template that can be edited when
the template is used to create new pages. To create an
editable region, first select a container, such as the side-
bar Div in this page. To select the sidebar Div, I placed
my cursor in the sidebar and then clicked the sidebar
tag in the tag selector at the bottom of the page.
Any area that’s not an Editable region can only be edited in the template itself, and any edits you make to a
part of the page that isn’t designated as Editable will automatically be updated on all the pages created from
the page.

97
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
6.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 selecting different contain-
ers in turn. For example, you could select the
Div with the ID of mainContent, just like you
selected the sidebar, and make it an editable
region as well. It’s common practice to leave fea-
tures that you want on all your pages, such as
banners, logos, or navigational elements, as
non-editable regions because you don’t want
these areas to change on the individual pages
you create from the template; they are areas
where you’ll likely want to make global updates
later.
5.
With a container selected, such as the sidebar,
choose Insert➪Template Objects➪Editable
Region. In the New Editable Region dialog box,
give the region a name (remember no spaces or
special characters) and then click OK. If you
don’t have visual aids turned off, Dreamweaver
will distinguish the editable region by surround-
ing it with a blue line and including a small tab at
the top with the name you gave the region.
7.
After you define all editable regions, choose File➪Save to
save the template. When you’re ready to create a new
page from the template, choose File➪New, just as you
would do to create any new page in Dreamweaver.
If you created your template using a page that includes text and images for a page in your site, you can use the
template to create that page.After you’re done, however, you might want to open the template again and
replace the actual page content with holder text and placeholder images because it’s less confusing.To create a
placeholder image, choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Image Placeholder and in the Placeholder image dialog box,
enter a name, height, and width.You can enter any height and width for a placeholder, Dreamweaver automati-
cally adjusts these settings to the true size of any image you use to replace the placeholder later.

98
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
9.
It’s always good practice to save a new page before you
start editing it by choosing File➪Save, just as you would
save any other new file in Dreamweaver. You can then
edit any of the editable regions in a page created from a
template. Remember, however, that you can’t alter any
of the areas that aren’t editable. In this example, I’m
inserting an image into the sidebar by first deleting the
placeholder text and then using the Insert Image icon at
the top of the workspace.
8.
In the New Document dialog box,
choose Page From Template from
the left-hand column, choose the
site you’re working on from the Site
column, and then choose the tem-
plate you want from the right
column. Notice that Dreamweaver
includes a preview of the template
in the right side of the dialog box.
10. You can add text to a Dreamweaver layout by
typing it into any editable region of the page,
and you can use the copy-and-paste technique
to bring text in from another program, such as
Microsoft Word. (See the nearby sidebar,
“Inserting text from another program,” for
more details on your copy-and-paste options in
Dreamweaver.) When you finish adding content
to the page, save it, and you’re ready to create
a new page with the template by again choos-
ing File➪New and repeating Step 8.

12. At any time, you can go back to the template to make changes to any
of the editable regions, and those changes will automatically be
applied to any pages created from the template. So, for example, you
could now create a list of links in the footer at the bottom of this page
and Dreamweaver will automatically add those links to all the pages
created from the template when you save the file. Notice in this figure
that the navigation links in the footer of this page aren’t in an editable
region. You find instructions for creating links in Dreamweaver in the
section “Setting Links in Dreamweaver,” later in this chapter.
11. Again, you can add text and images to any of
the editable regions just as you would add to
any page in Dreamweaver, by using
Insert➪Image and typing to enter text or using
copy-and-paste. If you want to align a Div tag or
another element to the left or right side of a
page, you can use the float-right and float-left
styles that are included in all Dreamweaver CSS
layouts. Don’t be confused by their abbrevia-
tions in the style sheet: Fltlft is the float left
style, and Fltrt is Float right. To apply align-
ment styles, select an image or another element
and choose the style you want from the Class
drop-down list in the Property inspector. When
you float an image to the right or left, as you see
here, any text or other elements wrap around
the image. Save the page when you’re done.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Although the Dreamweaver layouts are designed to display CSS and other formatting options according to con-
temporary standards, not all Web browsers support CSS the same way, so it’s always wise to test your designs in
a variety of Web browsers before you publish them.And here’s a tip: Internet Explorer does not display Dynamic
Web Templates, but Firefox does.Thus, if you’re working on a template and want to preview your work as you go
along, choose File➪Preview in Browser and choose Firefox from the list of browsers. If you haven’t associated
Firefox with Dreamweaver, choose Edit Brower List from the Preview in Browser list, and then click the plus (+)
sign next to Browsers to select and add to the list any browser on your hard drive.You can download a free copy
of Firefox from www.firefox.com. (You find more detailed instructions in Chapter 9 for previewing your
pages in multiple Web browsers and for adding new browsers to the preview list in Dreamweaver.)
Inserting text from another program
Dreamweaver gives you many options for
maintaining formatting when you copy and
paste text from another program. You can
change the default method for the way
Dreamweaver handles formatting when you
choose Edit➪Paste and alter the preferences
in the Copy/Paste category. And, you can
choose Edit➪Paste Special to make all
options available each time you paste new
content. Here are your six options:
 Text only: Dreamweaver strips any for-
matting and inserts plain text.
 Text with structure:
Dreamweaver
includes paragraphs, lists, tables, and
other structural-formatting options.
 Text with structure plus basic format-
ting: Dreamweaver includes structural
formatting as well as basic formatting,
such as bold and italic.
 Text with structure plus full formatting:
In addition to the previous options,
Dreamweaver includes formatting cre-
ated by style sheets in programs such as
Microsoft Word.
 Retain line breaks: Selecting this check
box ensures that line breaks are pre-
served, even if you don’t keep other for-
matting options.
 Clean up Word paragraph spacing:This
option is designed to address a common
problem in the way Microsoft Word para-
graph spacing is converted when con-
tent is pasted into an HTML file.
13. To save your changes and update any pages cre-
ated from the template at the same time, choose
File➪Save and in the Update Template Files
dialog box, click Update. Dreamweaver lists all
pages created from the template in this dialog
box so that you can see exactly which pages will
be changed. If you don’t want to apply the
changes to your pages, choose Don’t Update.
All new pages created from the template will
include the changes you made.

Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
Setting Links in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver is truly a dream when it comes to setting links. The most
important thing to keep in mind is that a link is essentially an address 
(a URL) that tells a visitor’s browser which page to open when the visitor
clicks the text or image containing the link.
If the page you want to link to is within your Web site, you can create a 
relative link, which includes a path describing how to get from the current
page to the linked page. A relative link doesn’t need to include the domain
name of the site — just the instructions for a browser to move from one
page within your site to another. (If you want to link to a page outside your
site, see the next section, “Linking to Another Web Site.”)
When you link from one page to another page in your Web site, the most
important thing to remember is to save your pages in your site’s root folder
(as described in “Defining a Web Site in Dreamweaver,” earlier in this chap-
ter) before you start setting links. Here’s how to create a link from one page
to another within a Web site:
Toolbox:
 Adobe Dreamweaver CS3
 A Web site with a root
folder defined in
Dreamweaver
 A GIF or JPEG image
(you find sample images
on this book’s companion
Web site at www.
DigitalFamily.
com/diy)
Time needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
In Dreamweaver, open the page where
you want to create a link. Select the
text or image that you want to serve
as the link (the text or image that a
user clicks to trigger the link). Click
and drag to highlight text, or click
once to select an image. In this exam-
ple, I selected the text Chocolate
Contest, and I want to link it to a
page named winners.html located
in a folder named Contest. Note that
all these files and folders are located
inside the same local root folder.
2.
Click the Link icon on the Common Insert bar, at
the top of the workspace. Alternatively, you can
set a link by using the Link field in the Property
inspector: Click the Browser button (which
looks like a yellow file folder). If you choose this
option, you skip the Hyperlink dialog box shown
in Step 4 and simply select the page you want to
link to from the Select File dialog box.

102
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
4.
The link is automatically set, and
the dialog box closes. If you create
a link by using text, as I do in this
example, the text changes to
reflect the style for a link. By
default, active links appear under-
lined and in dark blue. To test your
links, you have to view your page
in a browser, a process covered in
the section “Previewing Your Page
in a Browser,” later in this chapter.
3.
In the Hyperlink dialog box, click the Browse
icon (which looks like a yellow file folder) to the
right of the Link field, and in the Select File
dialog box, navigate on your hard drive to the
page you want to link your image or text to.
Click to select the filename of the page, and then
click OK (in Windows) or Choose (on the Mac).
Why so many fonts?
Although you can specify any font you want
for text on your Web pages, you don’t have
complete control over how the font appears
on a visitor’s computer. That’s because the
font you apply is displayed properly only if
visitors have the same font on their hard
drives. To help ensure that your text appears
as you intend, Dreamweaver offers collec-
tions of common fonts, grouped together in
families.
The browser displays the formatted text in
the first font available in the font list. For
example, if you choose the font collection
that starts with Georgia and a visitor doesn’t
have Georgia, the text is displayed in Times
New Roman (The second font in the list); if
the visitor’s browser doesn’t have that font
either, the text is displayed in Times; and 
so on.
You can create your own font collections by
selecting the Edit Font List option from the
bottom of the Font field in the Property
inspector and using the Edit Font List dialog
box. 
The only way to ensure that text appears in
the font you want is to display the text as a
graphic. That’s not a bad option for special
text, such as banners or logos, but it’s usu-
ally not a good option for all your text
because graphics take longer to download
than text and are harder to update later.

103
Linking to Another Web Site
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
Linking to a page on another Web site — called an external link — is even
easier than linking to an internal link. All you need is the URL of the page to
which you want to link, and you’re most of the way there.
To create an external link, follow these steps:
1.
In Dreamweaver, open the page from which
you want to link and click to select an image,
or click and drag to highlight the text that
you want to act as a link. In this example, 
I selected the text Visit DigitalFamily.
com, at the bottom of the page.
2.
In the Link text box in the Property inspector,
type the URL of the page you want your text 
or image to link to, and then press Enter 
(in Windows) or Return (on the Mac). You
can also copy and paste a URL from the
address bar in a Web browser, which is an
excellent way to ensure that you don’t enter
the address incorrectly.

Stuff You 
Need to Know

3.
The link is set automatically, and the text
changes to indicate that it’s an active link. To
test a link to another Web site, you must view
your page in a browser and be connected to the
Internet. For instructions, see “Previewing Your
Page in Multiple Browsers,” in Chapter 9.
104
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Although you don’t have to type http:// or even www. at the beginning of a Web site address to get to a
site in most browsers, you must always use the full URL, including the http:// part, when you create an
external link in HTML. Otherwise, the browser can’t find the correct external site address, and the visitor will
probably end up on an error page.
Adding paragraphs and line breaks
When you create page designs for the Web,
you must work within many limitations that
might be confusing at first, even if they
serve a purpose. How you create paragraph
and line breaks is a good example.
If you’re working in Design view in
Dreamweaver and press the Enter key (in
Windows) or the Return key (on the Mac),
Dreamweaver inserts a <p> (Paragraph) tag
in the code, which creates a line break fol-
lowed by a blank line. If you want a line
break without the extra blank line, hold
down the Shift key and press Enter or
Return; Dreamweaver inserts the <br />
tag into the code, to create a single line
break.
If you want to add a lot of space, you can
press Enter or Return multiple times, and
Dreamweaver inserts <p>&nbsp;</p>.
These Open and Close paragraph tags have
a nonbreaking space in the middle.
You can also add space to a page by using
margins or padding settings in CSS styles.
You find instructions for working with these
style options in the section “Creating New
Pages in Dreamweaver,” earlier in this 
chapter.
Note that you can add as much space as you
like to HTML code without changing the
page design. If you’re working in Code view
in Dreamweaver, you can add space within
the code by pressing the Enter or Return
keys, without affecting the way the page
appears in a Web browser.

Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver 105
Setting a Link to an E-Mail Address
Another common link option directs site visitors to an e-mail address.
Visitors can send you messages easily with e-mail links. I always recom-
mend that you invite visitors to contact you because they can point out
mistakes in your site and give you valuable feedback about how you can
further develop your site. Adding contact information also lends credibility
to a Web site because it shows that you’re accessible and open to being
contacted.
Setting a link to an e-mail address is just as easy as setting a link to another
Web page. All you need to know is the e-mail address you want to link to
and which text or image you want to use when you set the link.
1.
To create an e-mail link, select the text that you
want to link.
2.
With the text or image selected, click the Email
Link icon on the Common Insert bar.

 Dreamweaver CS3
 A Web site with a root

 An e-mail address
Time needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
3.
In the Email Link dialog box, enter the e-mail
address in the Link field and click OK. The
dialog box closes and the text automatically
changes to the style for an active link.

When visitors to your Web site click an e-mail link, the visitor’s computer system automatically launches the
default e-mail program and creates a blank e-mail message to the specified e-mail address.This is a cool trick,
but it can be disconcerting to users who don’t expect it to happen, and it doesn’t work if they don’t have an
e-mail program on their computer.That’s why I always try to let users know when I use an e-mail link. For exam-
ple, rather than just link the words Contact Janine, I link the words Email Janine. Even better, I often link the
actual e-mail address.
When you create an e-mail link on a Web page to be displayed on the public Internet, you open yourself to
spammers, some of whom use automated programs to “lift” e-mail addresses off Web pages.That’s why many
sites don’t include e-mail links, but instead use text such as “Send e-mail to Janine at jcwarner dot-com.”You
can also use a form to get around this potential problem. By setting up a form with a script that delivers the
form’s contents to an e-mail address, you can shield your e-mail address from spammers while still making it
easy for visitors to your site to send comments.A relatively new alternative is offered by the Web site
AddressMunger.com, which you can use to create a special script that shields your e-mail address from spam-
mers.You can find more information in Chapter 14 about AddressMunger.com and other services that you can
use to enhance your Web site.
4.
Note: The Email Link dialog box works only with text. If you want to use an
image as an e-mail link, you must select the image and then enter the e-mail
address, preceded by mailto: in the Link field in the Property inspector. In this
example, the image is selected, and the e-mail link has been created by entering
mailto:claire@digitalfamily.com.

Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver 107
Changing Page-Wide Settings 
with Page Properties
You can change many individual elements on a page in the Property inspec-
tor, but if you want to make changes that affect the entire page, such as
changing the background color of the entire page or changing the way links
and text are formatted, you can use the Page Properties dialog box.
Although you can apply global settings, such as text size and color, in the
Page Properties dialog box, you can override those settings with other for-
matting options in specific instances. For example, you can set all text to
the Helvetica font in the page properties and then change the font for an
individual headline to Verdana by using the Font field in the Property
inspector.
To change the font settings, background and text colors, and link colors for
an entire page, follow these steps:
1.
Choose Modify➪Page Properties or click the
Page Properties button in the Property inspec-
tor to open the Page Properties dialog box.
Select the Appearance category, click the Page
Font drop-down list, and choose the font collec-
tion you want to serve as the main font for the
text on your page. (See the earlier sidebar “Why
so many fonts?” to find out more about font 
collections.)
2.
In the Size drop-down list, specify the font size
you want for the text on your page. (In this
example, I selected Medium.) Click the Text
Color swatch box to reveal the color palette.
Choose any color you want for the text color on
the page. The color you select fills the color
swatch box but doesn’t change the text color
on the page until you click Apply or OK.

4.
Use the margin options at the bottom of the
dialog box to change the left, right, top, or
bottom margins of your page. Entering 0 in all
four of these fields creates designs whose edges
begin flush with the edge of a browser.
3.
Click the Background Color swatch box and
choose a color if you want to fill the back-
ground of the page with a solid color. To
insert a graphic into the background of your
page, click the Browse button next to the
Background image box, and in the Select
Image Source dialog box, select an image.
A background image automatically repeats
(or tiles) across and down the page unless
you choose no-repeat.
108
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
5.
To alter the display of links on a page, first select the Links category from
the left side of the Page Properties dialog box. Specify the font face and
size you want for the links on your page. If you don’t specify a font, links
appear in the same font and size that are specified for the text in your
document. 
6.
Specify a color for any link option (or all link
options) by clicking the color well and selecting
a color for each of the link states separately. The
color you select is applied to links on your page
based on the link state. All four link states can
be displayed in the same or different colors:
• Link Color: The color in which a link
appears when it’s first displayed on a
page
• Visited Links: The color of links that a
visitor has already clicked, or visited
• Rollover Links: The link color when a
user rolls the cursor over the link
(also known as hovering)
• Active Links: The link color when a
user is actively clicking it

109
Chapter 5: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
7.
In the Underline Style drop-down list, specify
whether you want links underlined. By default, all
links on a Web page appear underlined in a
browser, but many designers find the underline dis-
tracting and prefer to turn it off by selecting Never
Underline. You can also choose Show Underline
Only on Rollover to make the underline appear
when a user moves a cursor over a link. Hide
Underline on Rollover causes the underline to dis-
appear when a user moves a cursor over a link.
8.
As you alter the different settings,
you can click the Apply button to
see how the changes appear on
your page. After you specify all the
settings, click OK to finish and
close the Page Properties dialog
box.
Although you can set the link styles to better suit the design of your site, it’s good practice to use the same link
styles throughout your site, to save your visitors the confusion of having to identify multiple styles as links.
When you change the background, text, or link colors, make sure that the colors look good together and that
your text is still readable.As a general rule, light text is best displayed on a dark background, and dark text is
best displayed on a light background.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Adding Meta Tags for Search Engines
Some search engines read Meta tags for keywords and descriptions.
The first enables site designers to specify a list of keywords that match
the content on their Web sites when someone types the same keywords
into a search engine. Unfortunately, Meta keywords have been so
abused by Web designers attempting to mislead visitors about the true
content of their Web pages that most search engines ignore the Meta
keyword tag. Some search engines continue to recognize Meta key-
words, however, and it shouldn’t hurt your ranking with search engines
if you use this type of Meta tag.
The Meta description tag is designed to let you include a written
description of your Web site, and it often serves as the brief description
that appears in search results pages, so it’s definitely worth including in
your pages.
Follow these steps to fill in the Meta description tag:

To view or edit the Meta description after you
create it, choose either the Split or Code view
option, by clicking the corresponding button
at the top of the workspace. In this example,
I selected Split so that both Code view and
Design view are visible. To edit the Meta
description, locate it in the HTML code, and
then you can delete, change, or add text as you
would do in Design view. The description text
you enter is inserted into the Head area at the
top of the page in the HTML code. Meta content
doesn’t appear in the body of the page.
If you want to add keywords, repeat Steps 1 and
2 and choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪
Keywords in Step 1.
1.
Open the page where you want to add a 
Meta description. You can use Meta descrip-
tions on any page, or all pages, on your Web
site. Choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪
Description. In the Description text box, enter
the text you want for your page description.
(Don’t add any HTML code in this box.) 
When you click OK, the Meta description is
automatically added to the HTML code 
behind the page.

Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
I
ntroduce yourself to the world with a profile or portfolio site. A
Web site about yourself is a powerful tool that can help you land
your dream job, attract high-profile clients, or even reconnect with
long-lost friends and family.
Perhaps the biggest challenge to creating a profile or portfolio site
is determining the best way to summarize your life experience, tal-
ents, and body of work:
 If you’re an artist, you can photograph your paintings or
sculptures to create a visual portfolio of your work to dis-
play online.
 If you’re a consultant, you can develop a collection of case
studies describing your success with previous clients or
featuring your best designs.
 If you’re a writer, you can include a collection of published
articles or showcase writing that hasn’t been published
anywhere else — after all, a Web site enables you to
become your own publisher.
No matter what you do, you probably want to create a biography about yourself.
Whether your bio is serious or silly, trying to sum up your own life in a few paragraphs
is likely to be one of the most challenging things you will ever write (which is why I
include a few tips for writing a great biography in the sidebar “Telling your own tale”).
In this chapter, you also discover the basics of bringing your ideas to life on the Web.
Working in Dreamweaver, you can start with the templates that come with this book
and find out how to transform the templates into your own creations.
Starting with Profile or Portfolio Templates
The instructions in this chapter are designed to be used with the templates and
images provided on the Web site for this book (www.DigitalFamily.com/diy).
You can choose a profile template or a portfolio template, depending on the type of
site you want to create. To download a template, just check the Web site for the
chapter number and template name listed in the Toolbox and then follow the simple
instructions on the site to download the files. The step-by-step instructions in this
chapter explain how to personalize the templates; add and edit images; and change
colors, fonts, and other style options.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
If you’re new to working with Dreamweaver, you might want to read Chapter 5 to
become familiar with the basics of working with Dreamweaver before you dive into
creating a site with a template.
Introducing the profile template
If you want to showcase your personal or professional experience, the profile tem-
plate is designed to make it easy to create a simple Web site that features your work
or hobbies. The first task in this chapter is the simplest of the template designs in
this book. It features one page that’s designed to showcase a biography, testimoni-
als, and samples of your work or interests.
As you work through the steps in the first task, remember that you can alter the tem-
plate a little (by simply adding your own text and images) or alter the design a lot by
changing the colors, font options, and other style settings, to make the design more
your own.
If you want to create a profile site with multiple pages, you can save copies of the
page design and create links to as many pages as you need. If you know that you
want to create a site with multiple sections, you may want to use the portfolio site
template featured in the second half of this chapter because it includes multiple
page designs that are already linked. (See the next section for an introduction to the
portfolio template.)
Figure 6-1 shows an example of a design created using the profile template featured
later, in the section “Designing a Winning Online Profile.” The profile template fea-
tures a banner graphic created in Photoshop Elements. You find instructions for
editing the banner graphic in the section “Customizing the Portfolio Banner
Graphic.”
Figure 6-1: You can create a profile site, like the one shown in this figure, 
by editing the profile template featured in this chapter.

113
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
Creating a multipage portfolio site
If you’re an artist, a photographer, a graphic designer, or another creative profes-
sional, the portfolio site is for you! This template is designed to showcase a portfolio
with an image gallery, and thus includes five main pages: one for the front page,
shown in Figure 6-2; a second for an about page, which can also be used for a biogra-
phy; and finally, one (three total) for each of the three galleries. The links among the
main pages have already been created in the template files, making it easy to
develop your own multipage site, like the one shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2: The Portfolio template is designed to showcase three galleries of images, 
such as the nature photography shown here.
If you’re a photographer with hundreds or thousands of photos that you want to
share online, you might be better served by one of the many photo-sharing sites on
the Web, such as Flickr.com, or a professional photography site like Creative Photo
Solutions at www.ifp3.com. You find a list of photo sites in the nearby sidebar
“Many ways to share your photos.”
Because the portfolio site is more complex than the profile site featured in the first
part of this chapter, you find three separate tasks designed to help you fully cus-
tomize this site:

The first task, in the section “Customizing the Portfolio Banner Graphic,”
shows you how to edit the banner graphic, the image that appears at the top
of this page design, using Photoshop Elements. You can edit the graphics
included with the template files in any image editor that supports Layers,
including Adobe Photoshop CS3 or Photoshop Elements. (Note: If you
prefer to use text for the banner, you can simply delete the placeholder
graphic at the top of the page and enter text in its place.)

The second task, in the section “Customizing the Portfolio Home Page,”
shows you how to use Dreamweaver to replace the text and images in these
templates and how to make basic color and style changes.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Many ways to share your photos
You can find many excellent photo-sharing
Web sites on the Internet, including the ones
highlighted in this list:
IFP3 Creative Photo Solutions: If you’re a
professional photographer and want to
create a Web site where you can sell photos
online, consider a site like www.ifp3.com,
designed to make it easy to upload and dis-
play photos as well as manage online sales.
Flickr: Flickr (www.flickr.com) is one of the
most sophisticated online photo sites, offer-
ing a wide range of services, including the
ability to manage lots and lots of pictures in
multiple personal albums. You also get more
advanced options for adding captions and
other text to your online album.
If you blog, you might appreciate the Flickr
features that make it easy to add photos to
a blog or online journal. You can even search
through photos from other Flickr users and
add their photos to your albums. (Sharing is
optional: You can keep your albums private
or make any or all of your images viewable
by anyone who uses the site.)
Photobucket:You can not only manage large
numbers 
of 
photos 
at 
Photobucket
(www.photobucket.com) but also upload
and share video. One feature that makes
this site extremely popular is the ease with
which you can add photos and videos that
are hosted at Photobucket to your blog or
your profile on sites like MySpace and
Facebook.
Kodak EasyShare Gallery:
The Kodak
Gallery site (www.kodakgallery.com) is
easy to use. You can upload photos you take
using any digital camera, phone, or film;
share your photos with friends, family, or
whomever; and print your favorite pictures
and shop for photo keepsakes and gifts,
such as magnets, mugs, and coasters. Folks
who look at your photos can sign a guest-
book so that you know they’ve been there.
.Mac: If you use an Apple Macintosh com-

The third task, in the section “Creating New Pages from a Dynamic Web
Template,” covers how to create new pages from Dynamic Web Templates in
Dreamweaver, how to set links to new pages, and how to use these tem-
plates to make global changes across the pages you create.

Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
To help you get started and to make it easy for you to build a complete site quickly,
I created two template pages for your portfolio site — one for the gallery pages and
another for the front page design. You can use these templates to generate as many
pages as you like for the site. Because these templates use Dreamweaver’s Dynamic
Web Template features, however, you will find some restrictions on what can be
altered in pages generated from the templates, because some areas of the templates
are locked, a feature that makes it possible to make global changes across all pages
created from a template. You find detailed instructions on how to work with tem-
plates and locked regions in the tasks that follow.
To help you get started with this site and to ensure that the links on the navigation
bars work properly, I created pages for each of the main sections from the templates.
You can use any or all of these pages to create your own site, and you can easily add
pages from the templates. These are the pages you find in the site:

index.html is the front page.

about.html is for your biography or other general information.

gallery1.html is for the first page of the first gallery.

gallery2.html is for the first page of the second gallery.

gallery3.html is for the first page of the third gallery.
Naming your files so that they correspond to their contents, as I have here, makes it
easier to identify the pages later when you want to edit them.

Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
Telling your own tale
Writing your own biography may seem like
an easy task. After all, you’re arguably the
best expert in the world on the topic of you.
But if you sit down to write your own story
and find that the words don’t come easily,
rest assured that you’re not alone. Summing
up your life in a few words or paragraphs
can make the most-experienced writers
want to procrastinate with a run to the fridge
for a little snack or the inexplicable impulse
to organize a desk or closet.
To help you get started, here are a few sug-
gestions for writing your own biography.
 Brainstorm a list of all accomplishments
or key points you want to include with-
out worrying about writing them well or
putting them in order. Then check each
one off the list as you work it into your
written biography.
 Ask friends or colleagues how they
describe you and what they consider
your best skills, and then use their ideas
in your biography. This strategy is also a
good way to get testimonials for your
Web site.
 Decide whether you want to create a
professional biography or a personal
one. Then set the tone based on that
decision. Consider your goals. When vis-
itors to your Web site read your bio, do
you want them to take you seriously, or
do you want them to appreciate your
creative vision? Do you want to focus on
achievements or use humor to bring out
your personality? Chapter 1 discusses in
more detail how to plan goals for a site.
 Professional biographies are often writ-
ten in the third person (“she” rather than
“you” or “I”) and in a more-formal style.
If you’re writing a professional biogra-
phy, imagine that an emcee will use it to
introduce you before you give a speech
to an audience of people who have
never met you.
 Personal biographies can be much more
informal, and are more likely to be writ-
ten in the first person (“I” rather than
“he” or “you”). In this case, you might
imagine that you’re writing to a new
pen pal and introducing yourself for the
first time.
 Remember that you can combine these
two approaches, using the first person
with a more formal style, for example, or
using the third person with a sprinkle of
humor and silliness.
 Start your biography with your most-
important accomplishment, a short list
of skills or titles, or a brief anecdote that
captures something important about
who you are. Your goal is to give readers
a good sense of who you are or what
you do even if they read only the first
sentence or two.
When you’re finished, make sure to have
someone you trust review your biography
to make sure it reads well and covers the
most-important points before you add it to
your Web site.

Choose File➪Save As and name the page
index.html. (See the sidebar “Creating new
pages in a profile site” for details on why the
main file of a site should be named index.)
Then change the page title by replacing the text
in the Title field, at the top of the Dreamweaver
workspace, with your name and a brief title or
description to identify your profile page. (Note:
The page title isn’t displayed in the body of the
page; this is the text that appears on the title
bar at the top of the browser window.)
3.
When you complete the site setup
process, the files and folders in the
profile template are displayed in
the Files panel in Dreamweaver, to
the side of the workspace. Double-
click on the profile-template.
html file to open the profile page
design in Dreamweaver. (For more
detailed instructions on the site
set-up process, see Chapter 5.)
5.
At the top of the page, click and drag to select
the text Your name here and replace it by
typing your own name or any other text you
want to appear at the top of the page. In this
example, I changed the text to David
LaFontaine.

7.
In the Select Image Source dialog box, navigate
your hard drive to find the image you want to
insert and then double-click the image filename
to select it. If the photo or other image you
select in Step 6 isn’t already located in the local
root folder of your site, Dreamweaver offers to
copy the file into the root folder. (You find more
detailed instructions for adding images in
Chapter 5.)
119
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
6.
To insert the photo or other image you want to
use in this design, click to select the image
placeholder (the gray box) in the left column
and then click the Browse button (the yellow
folder icon) in the Src field in the Property
inspector.
8.
Click and drag to select the text next to the image in the
left column and then type to replace it with your biogra-
phy or any other text you want to appear on the front of
your profile site. Note that you can also use copy and
paste to replace this text with text from another file,
such as a word-processing document.

120
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
10. Continue replacing text and other elements on
the page, such as the work samples section. To
replace the text in a headline, click and drag to
select the headline and then type to replace the
text. Note that although this design includes
formatted text areas for testimonials and work
samples, you can easily delete any elements
you don’t want to use or add sections as 
necessary.
9.
Use the formatting icons in the Property inspec-
tor, at the bottom of the work area, to add bold,
italic, and other formatting options. To remove
bold formatting, simply highlight the bold text
and click on Bold button. (Dreamweaver auto-
matically creates CSS styles when you use these
features.) You find more details on formatting
text and working with styles in Chapter 5.
11. To add images, such as a banner graphic for the
top of the page, click to place the cursor where
you want to insert the image, and choose
Insert➪Image. In the Insert Image dialog box,
navigate your hard drive to find the image you
want to insert. Here’s an advanced tip: If you
add a graphic in place of the name at the top of
the page, as shown here, you may need to
delete the H1 formatting to make room for the
image. To remove a heading tag, such as H1,
click to select the image or text that’s being
affected by the tag and then choose None from
the Format drop-down list in the upper-left
corner of the Property inspector.

12. To change the red stripe down the
right side of this design, you can
remove the background image or
replace the image with one that
uses a different color. Because this
image is inserted using a style, first
open the CSS panel by choosing
Window➪CSS, and then click the
All tab at the top of the panel to
display the list of styles. Double-
click to select the style named
#container. Select the Background
Category on the left side of the CSS
Rule Definition dialog box, and then
select and delete all text in the
Background Image field to delete it;
or, use the Browse button to locate
another image to replace it with a
new image. Click OK to close the
dialog box and automatically apply
any changes to the background.
121
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
Creating new pages in a profile site
The main page of any Web site should be
named index.html. (If you use a Windows
server, you may need to change the name
to default.html.) The rest of the pages can
be named anything you like, as long as you
don’t use spaces or special characters
(hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are okay),
and you include the .html extension at the
end of every page. (Dreamweaver adds the
extension for you automatically when you
create and save pages in Dreamweaver.)
You can create new or additional pages for
your site from the profile template featured
in this chapter by simply choosing File➪
Save As and giving the file a new name.
(Just be sure that you don’t delete the 
extension.)

122
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Customizing the Portfolio Banner Graphic
You can edit the banner graphic at the top of this portfolio template to
better match the design you want for your Web site. You can edit the
graphic in any image editor that supports Layers, including Adobe
Photoshop CS3 and Photoshop Elements, which is used in this task. The
process is almost exactly the same with either program. This graphic, and
others featured in the templates in this book, are designed with Layers to
make it easy for you to customize the images, as you see in this task:
1.
Launch a graphics program, such as Photoshop
Elements (shown here), choose File➪Open, and
open the portfolio-banner.tif template
image file. (You find this file in the images
folder inside the portfolio template folder that
you download from the DigitalFamily.com/
diy Web site.)
2.
Open the Layers palette by choos-
ing Window➪Layers. The Layers
palette displays the three layers in
this image: one for the background,
one for the text Portfolio Name,
and one for the text By Your
Name Here. Note: Each element in
these images is on a separate layer
to make it possible to edit the ele-
ments separately. For example, you
can change the color of the words
Portfolio Name without chang-
ing the color of the other text or
affecting the background color.

With the Type tool active, click and
drag to select a section of text and
then type to replace the words.
Adjust the Type tool settings on the
Options bar at the top of the work
area to change the color, font face,
size, or other options. In this figure,
I’m adjusting the font size for the
selected text, which I changed to
read Nature Photographs.
3.
To edit the text in any image in Photoshop Elements, first select the Type
tool in the Toolbox.
5.
To reposition the text on the banner, click to
select the Move tool from the Toolbox. (In
Photoshop Elements, the Move tool is repre-
sented by the double-headed crossed-arrow
icon at the top of the Toolbox.) Then click and
drag a section of text to adjust it. Note that if
you click and drag a corner, you change the size
of the text; if you click in the middle of a text
area and drag, you move the text.
6.
To change the background of a layered image like this
one, first click to select the Move tool from the toolbox,
and then click in the Layers palette on the right side of
the screen to select the background layer.

124
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
8.
Choose Select➪All to select the image, and
then choose Edit➪Copy to copy it. Then click
anywhere on the banner image to make it the
active image in the workspace, and choose
Edit➪Paste to insert the photo. The image
appears on a new layer. Select the Layer and
click and drag to adjust the photograph’s place-
ment on the banner.
7.
To add a photograph as a background layer, you
must first open the photograph (while the
banner image is still open) by choosing
File➪Open and selecting the image from your
hard drive. (To help you follow along with these
steps, you find in the template folder the Zuma
birds photo shown here. You’re welcome to use
this photo in your site, or you can use an image
of your own.)
10. To optimize the banner for your
Web page, choose File➪Save For
Web. In the Save for Web dialog box,
choose JPEG from the Optimized
File Format drop-down list in the
upper-right corner. The JPEG format
is best for images that use millions
of colors, such as photographs. If
this banner had a solid background,
the GIF or PNG formats would be
better options. (You find more
details on optimizing images for the
Web in Chapter 4.)
9.
After you make these changes to the banner
image, it’s time to save it. Here’s a trick: You
save it twice, once with all the layers as a high-
resolution image and then as an optimized, low-
resolution image for use on the Web (covered in
Step 10). To save the layered version, you can
simply choose File➪Save to replace the tem-
plate image with your changes, or you can use
File➪Save As to make a copy. If the TIFF
Options dialog box opens, you don’t need to
make any changes — just press OK to save the
file with the current settings.

125
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
12. Alter the compression level until the image uses the greatest amount of compression
(represented by the lowest number in the Quality field), without noticeably degrading
the appearance of the image. You can see the effect on the file size at the bottom of
each of the previews. In this example, the Quality setting was reduced to 60 to achieve
a file size of 15.06K, less than a tenth of the original 337K.
11. To reduce the size of a JPEG image, use the slider to
alter the Quality setting, or enter a number, up to 100.
Compression is measured as a percentage: the lower
the number, the higher the compression and the
smaller the file size. Note that the preview on the right
represents the optimized version; on the left is a pre-
view of the original, for comparison. Choose the Hand
tool from the upper-left corner of the dialog box and
click and drag to position the most-important elements
in the image where you can get a better preview.
13. After you have all the settings the way you want them
for your image, click OK. In the Save dialog box, you can
give the image a new name or keep the name as it is and
save it in the images folder. (Yes, it’s the same images
folder that’s in the root folder you identified during the
site-setup process with the portfolio template files.)
Congrats! You’re ready to add your personalized banner
to your Web pages and start making them your own.
See the next section for details.

this dialog box alone for now, and click OK to
close the Site Definition dialog box and save
your settings. (For more detailed instructions
on the site-setup process, see Chapter 5.)
126
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Customizing the Portfolio Home Page
After you edit the image that will appear at the top of your page design,
you’re ready to start working on the template, by adding your own text and
images to make the site your own. Think of this step as the one where you
get to add in all the content you’ve collected (see Chapter 1 for details on
collecting content).
The portfolio template created for this chapter is made up of several pages,
including two template files that can be used to generate additional pages.
The template files are saved in the Templates folder, which is inside the
main Portfolio Template folder. These template files are special because
they use the Dreamweaver Dynamic Web Template features, which is why
they end in .dwt rather than .html, like the other pages in this site. In this
task, you find instructions for editing the portfolio template files to add the
banner image to all pages in this site, as well as how to edit the front page
of the site. To set up your portfolio site in Dreamweaver and edit the home
page, follow these steps:
1.
In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪New Site. In the
Site Definition dialog box, click the Advanced
tab. In the Site Name text box, type a name 
for your site. In this example, I entered 
My Photography Site.

Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
3.
After you complete the site-setup process, the files and
folders in the template are displayed in the Files panel
in Dreamweaver, to the side of the workspace. To open
a folder in the Files panel and display its contents, click
on the plus (+) sign to the left of the folder. In this
figure, you can see that two templates and five HTML
pages are in the Templates folder. To edit the front page
of this site, double-click on the index.html file in the
Files panel to open it in the design area.
4.
With index.html open, change
the page title by replacing the text
in the Title field, at the top of the
Dreamweaver workspace, with a
brief title or description to identify
your site. In this example, I changed
the title to Photographer Janine
Warner. (Note: The page title isn’t
displayed in the body of the page —
this is the text that appears at the
top of the browser window.)
One of the biggest benefits of using Dynamic Web Templates (as you see in the following steps) is that when you
make a change to a template file and then save it, that change is automatically applied to all pages in the Web
site that were created from the template file.You find instructions for how to create and edit templates like
these in Chapter 5.

128
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
6.
Repeat Step 5 until you have replaced all three
images. If you don’t want to use images in all
three boxes, you can delete any of the image
placeholders and enter text in its place. Note
that when an image is selected, the options for
that image appear in the Property inspector, at
the bottom of the workspace.
5.
You can replace the three images featured in the
middle of this page design in a couple of ways.
The simplest method is to double-click the first
of the three template images and in the Select
Image Source dialog box, click to select the
image you want to use in its place. (If you use
this method, be sure to then click to select the
image and in the Property inspector at the
bottom of the page, change the text in the Alt
field by deleting the words Nature Photo and
entering a description of your image.) For the
best results, insert images that are no more than
220 pixels wide so that they fit within this
design. If you want to use larger images, you
need to change the width settings in the corre-
sponding styles, as described in Steps 17 and 18,
later in this task.
7.
To add a caption or other text, click and drag
to select the placeholder text and then type
to enter your new text. You can add as much
text as you like to each box, but be aware
that if you don’t use the same amount of text
in each box, the size of the boxes differ and
throw off the balance of the design.

129
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
10. Double-click the banner image and then use the
Select Image dialog box to select the image you
want to use in its place. In this case, I replaced
the placeholder image with the template
banner that I customized in the previous task.
(Remember that if you use this technique to
replace the image, you should click to select
the image after it’s inserted and then enter a text
description of the image in the Alt field in the
Property inspector.)
9.
To change the banner image at the top of the page, first
open the template file named main.dwt, which is saved
in the Templates folder. You can open a template file like
you would open any other page in Dreamweaver, by
double-clicking on its name in the Files panel or choos-
ing File➪Open and selecting the file.
8.
If you try to select the banner image at the top
of the template design, you may be frustrated
that you can’t delete it or replace it in this
index.html file. That’s because it’s in a
locked region of the template file. You can tell
the difference between locked and unlocked
regions because when you click on anything in
a locked region, the cursor changes to a circle
with a line through it — the universal symbol
for “You can’t do that.” Among the many bene-
fits to having locked regions in Dynamic Web
Templates is that you can change the contents
of a locked region, like this banner image, only
by editing the template file itself, which you do
in Step 9.

130
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
13. You can make additional changes to this page design,
such as altering the color of the navigation bar or the
font face used in the captions, by altering the CSS defi-
nitions that control the styles on this page. To do so,
first open the CSS Panel by choosing Window➪
CSS Styles or clicking on the small arrow next to
the CSS Panel name on the side of the workspace.
12. When you have multiple Web pages open in
Dreamweaver, each page is represented by a
small tab at the top of the workspace. Thus, if
you want to view the index page to see the
results of the change you made to the template,
click on the tab that represents the index page
and make it the active page in the work area.
11. When you save the template file with the new
banner, Dreamweaver launches the Update
Template Files dialog box with a list of all files
created with the open template. In this case,
only the index page was created from this tem-
plate, so it’s the only one listed. To apply this
change to the index page, click the Update
button. If the template had been used to create
many pages, this process would update all
pages created from the template — a useful
time-saver when you’re working with many simi-
lar files in a Web site.

16. To change the font face or color
used in the navigation bar, double-
click #navbar style to open the
CSS Rule Definition dialog box. In
the Type category, use the Font
drop-down list to select a font set.
Similarly, click in the color well to
choose a font color. Click Apply 
to see the results of the change 
and then click OK to close the
dialog box.
15. Click the Apply button in the CSS
Rule Definition dialog box to see
the effects of editing a style. In this
example, the color of the navigation
bar changes to dark brown rather
than dark blue. Click OK to close
the dialog box. Note that if the style
is in an external style sheet, like the
style in this template, Dreamweaver
automatically opens the style sheet
in the work area behind the page
you’re editing. (You can see the
style sheet in the upper-left corner
of this figure — it’s named
main.css.) You must save the
external style sheet before you
close it, to permanently save your
style changes.
131
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
14. To change the color of the dark
blue navigation bar just below the
banner, you edit the background
color in the style named #navbar.
The simplest way to do that is to
double-click on the style named
#navbar in the CSS Panel. In the
CSS Rule Definition dialog box that
opens, click on the Background cat-
egory on the left and then click on
the color well. You can use the eye-
dropper to select any color from
the color palette or click to select
any color on the screen, such as
the dark brown color I’m selecting
by clicking on the dark feathers of
the duck in the photograph in the
banner.

132
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
18. To change the width of the overall page 
design, you change the width specified in 
the #container style. Double-click on 
#container in the CSS panel, select the Box
category, and then change the width setting by
specifying a number of pixels. Note, however,
that this page was designed to be 780 pixels
wide so that it displays well in 800 x 600 resolu-
tion. If you increase the size, anyone with a
small monitor must scroll from left to right to
see the entire design.
CSS styles provide formatting instructions for different elements on a page. (You find an introduction to working
with styles in Chapters 3 and 5.) To identify a page element’s corresponding style, place your cursor in the area
of the page you want to change and then use the tag selector, at the bottom of the workspace. For example, if I
place my cursor in the caption of the middle photo, I can see that the text is formatted using the style named
.image-caption and that it’s contained in the style named #photo2. Click on the tag in the tag selector
to highlight the corresponding content in the workspace.
17. To change the size of the boxes that
contain the three images and their
captions, you adjust each box sepa-
rately, by double-clicking on the
style name (the boxes are named
#photo1, #photo2, and #photo3)
and again by using the Box category
to adjust the width. Be aware, how-
ever, that if you change the width of
any or all of the photo boxes, you
may also need to adjust the overall
width of the page design by altering
the #container style. The design
of this page was carefully created
so that the total size of each photo
box, plus the margins and padding
added to each box, add up to the
total width of the container. 

133
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
The Portfolio template features two Dynamic Web Template files that can
be used to generate additional pages. In this task, you create new pages
from a Dynamic Web Template and make global changes to those pages by
editing the template file.
Before you can complete this task, you must complete the site setup
process in Dreamweaver. If you completed the preceding task, “Customizing
the Portfolio Home Page,” you should be ready to go; if not, you first need
to complete Steps 1 through 3 in the previous task. (For more detailed
instructions on the site set-up process, see Chapter 5). In this example,
I use the gallery.dwt template to create a series of pages to display a
collection of photographs.

all the links to the main pages and galleries on the naviga-
tion bar, I already created pages named gallery1.html,
gallery2.html, and gallery3.html. These three pages
were created from the gallery.dwt Dynamic Web
Template, which you use in this set of steps. However, to
keep the links working and ensure that the first page of
your gallery appears when a user clicks on the correspon-
ding link on the navigation bar, you should first edit the
main gallery page. In this example, I create the second
gallery with the deer photos, so I start by opening
gallery2.html.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
3.
To add a second page to this gallery by using
the gallery.dwt Dynamic Web Template,
choose File➪New. Then, in the New Document
dialog box, choose Page from Template (from
the options on the left). Make sure that the Web
site you’re working on is selected in the middle
column, and choose the gallery template from
the right-hand column. (Notice that a preview
of the selected template is displayed on the far
right side of this dialog box.) Click Create to
generate a page from the template.
2.
To replace the image placeholder in the middle of the
page with a photograph, double-click to select the place-
holder image and then in the Select Image dialog box,
click to select a photograph to insert into the page in its
place. To enter a caption, delete and replace the text that
appears beneath the photo. (Remember that if you use
this technique to replace the image, you need to click to
select the image after it’s inserted and enter a text
description of the image in the Alt field in the Property
inspector.)

5.
Again, to replace the image placeholder in the
middle of the page with a photograph, double-
click to select the placeholder image and in the
Select Image dialog box, click to select a photo-
graph to insert into the page in its place.
(Remember that if you use this technique to
replace the image, you should click to select
the image after it’s inserted and then enter a
text description of the image in the Alt field in
the Property inspector.) To enter a caption,
delete and replace the text that appears
beneath the photo.
4.
Don’t be confused by the fact that I’m working
on the second gallery in this example. You will
follow the same steps for each of the three gal-
leries, and you can work on them in any order.
Before you do anything else, save the new page
by choosing File➪Save (or by using the key
combination Ctrl+S on a PC or Ô+S on a Mac).
Because I know that I will create a series of
pages for Gallery 2, I created a new folder
named gallery2 as I saved this page and then
saved the new gallery page into that folder. The
first page of the gallery was already created in
the original template folder and it’s named
gallery2, so I decided to name my new page
gallery2b.html. I’ll name the third page
gallery2c.html. Using a naming convention
that helps you keep track of the order of your
images makes it easier to set the links among
your gallery pages, which you do in Steps 7
through 9 of this task.
135
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
6.
Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to create additional
gallery pages, save them in the new gallery
folder you created, and add a photo and caption
to each page. To link the pages, click on the tab
to bring the first gallery page to the front of the
workspace. In this example, the first page is
named gallery2.html. (If it’s not still open,
choose File➪Open and open the first of the
pages in the gallery you’re working on.)

136

8.
In the Hyperlink dialog box, click the Browse
button (it looks like a yellow file folder) to the
right of the Link field, and then navigate on
your hard drive to the file you want to link 
to. In the figure, I’m linking to the second 
image in the new gallery, which I named
gallery2b.html and saved in a folder named
gallery2. Click OK to finish setting the link
and close the dialog box.
7.
To add links among the pages of
the gallery, first add some text
above or below the image. In this
example, I added Previous
Image ~ Next Image. Next, you
need to link the text to the corre-
sponding image page by clicking
and dragging to select the text you
want to use as the link and then
clicking the link icon in the upper-
left corner of the workspace. (The
icon looks like a link in a chain.)
9.
Open the second page in the gallery.
In this example, it’s the page named
gallery2b.html. Again add text
to the page, such as Previous
Image ~ Next Image. Click and
drag to select the text (Next
Image) in the page that will be
linked, and then click the Link icon
to open the Hyperlink dialog box.
Browse to find the next page in the
sequence (in this example,
gallery2c.html) and double-click
to select that page. Click OK to
close the dialog box and set the link.
Then click and drag to select the
text you want to link to the previous
image, click the Link icon, and
browse to select the previous file —
gallery2.html. Click OK to close
the dialog box and set the link.

11. For the first and last gallery pages, either
include only one link (to the next or previous
image, as appropriate) or link back to the
first image from the last and to the last image
from the first so that a visitor to the site can
continue through the images repeatedly. (To
save numerous pages you’re working on at a
time, choose File➪Save All.)
10. Continue setting the next and previous links
among each of the pages in the gallery. To 
save time, you can use the copy-and-paste
technique to copy the text from one gallery
page to another. If you followed a similar
naming convention, you can simply highlight
the linked text after it’s copied to the new
page and then change the name of the file in
the Properties inspector, at the bottom of the
workspace.
137
Chapter 6: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
12. Because the banner graphic is in a locked region at the top of the gallery
page template, replace the banner at the top of all these gallery pages
automatically by simply replacing the gallery image once in the tem-
plate. To do so, open the gallery.dwt file, located in the Templates
folder.

138
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
14. Make any other changes you want to the tem-
plate file, such as changing the text About 
the Artist on the navigation bar to About
the Photographer. (Be sure to change this
text on the top and bottom navigation bars.)
After you complete all the changes you want to
make to the template, choose File➪Save, and
Dreamweaver automatically updates all pages
created from this template — including the
gallery1.html and gallery2.html pages
and the about.html page in this site.
13. With the template file open, click to select the
banner image placeholder and delete it by
pressing the Delete key. Then, without moving
your cursor, choose Insert➪Image and select
the image you want to use in its place. In this
case, I replaced the placeholder image with the
same Nature Photographer banner that I cus-
tomized in the first task in this series. Because
this site is created with two different templates,
you can use a different banner image in the
gallery.dwt template than the one used in
the main.dwt template, which was used to
create the home page.
15. Always preview your pages in a Web browser
as you’re working on a Web site so that you
can test your links and ensure that your pages
are displayed properly. Preview a page in
Dreamweaver by choosing File➪Preview in
Browser and then selecting a Web browser
from the list.

Chapter 7
Creating a Business Web Site
O
nce in a while, I still meet small-business owners who ask,
“Do I really need to have a Web site?” Yet, for the most
part, it seems that the owners of even the smallest businesses
have caught on. Today, the answer is easy: “Anyone who wants to
promote their business needs a Web site.”
Whether you’re creating a site for the first time or redesigning a
site that you think could serve your business better, you’ll find
what you need in this chapter. You walk through the steps of cus-
tomizing two distinct template designs that work well for small
businesses. And, remember: You can use any of the templates in
this book for a business site by following the instructions to per-
sonalize the pages and images.
Introducing the Business Site Template
I call the main template featured in this chapter the Jellyfish template because it was
inspired by the images featured in the Jellyfish aquarium site you see in the figures
at the beginning of this chapter. As with all other templates in this book, you can
alter this one a little or a lot and use it for any kind of site you want to create.
If you want to rename any of the files or folders in this template site, be sure to do so
in the Dreamweaver Files panel, to ensure that Dreamweaver automatically adjusts
the links that correspond to the files.
In this chapter, you find templates designed to be used in an image editor, such as
Photoshop or Fireworks, as well as the Jellyfish template, which can be used in
Dreamweaver. The starter image is named FrontPage-Template.tif.
To help you get started with your business site, I included starter pages for each 
of the main sections that a business site commonly needs. The links in these 
starter pages are already set on a navigation bar across the bottom of the page. 
You can customize the overall look and feel of these pages by editing the template,

Jellyfish-Template.tif, on which the pages are based. You find this file in the
Templates folder inside the Jellyfish Template folder. You can also add or remove
pages and change the links as necessary. The following list describes the files and
folders that get you started when you first open the Jellyfish template:

index.html: This page is the front page of your Web site. The main page of
any Web site should be named index; the rest of the pages can be named
anything you like, as long as you don’t use spaces or special characters.

about.html: List information about the subject of your site, such as a biog-
raphy of a person or a description of a business or service.

page-1.html: List additional information or create a new section of your site,
such as a listing of products, services, or staff.

page-2.html: Use this page for any additional information. You can add
pages as necessary by following the instructions later in this chapter for
adding new pages to a template site.

contact.html: Add contact information to this page.

images: All your template image files are in this folder, in TIFF format. You
also find in this folder optimized JPEG files that you can use as you follow
along with the tasks.
You also find subfolders in this Web site template folder. The images folder contains
the starter images for this site and provides a good place for you to store any images
you want to add to the site. You also find the css folder, which is where I saved the
CSS file that accompanies these page designs. As with all other templates that
accompany this book, you can alter this one a little or a lot and use it for any kind of
site you might want to create.

141
Chapter 7: Creating a Business Web Site
Editing and Sizing Images for the Template
I like to prepare at least some of my images in a program like Photoshop or
Photoshop Elements before I even start working in Dreamweaver. To help
you get your images ready for this design, I included a starter image, which
is a graphics file composed of many different layers, each containing a sep-
arate element in the design. 
In this task, you use this starter image as a guide as you prepare the photos
and other images you want to use in your site. In the task that follows, you
copy and paste your own photos into the starter image and use it as a
guide as you resize your images to fit the Web site template. After you have
all your images in place, you crop out each one and use the Save for Web
option to optimize them for the Web.
The front page of this template design has several elements — photos as
well as text — and it can be altered in many ways. The more you change
the design in Photoshop, the more you need to alter the corresponding
template in Dreamweaver.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Launch a graphics program, such as
Photoshop CS3 (as shown here),
choose File➪Open, and open the file
named FrontPage-Template.tif.
The tricky part about this front page
design is that one large image takes
up most of the area at the top, and
then three smaller images below it
link to each of the main sections of
the site. For best results with this
template, create images that are
exactly the same size as these so
that you can replace them in the
Dreamweaver template without
disrupting the layout.
If you see the error message “Some text layers contain fonts that are missing” when you open the Front
Page-Template.tif starter image, it simply means that you don’t have on your computer’s hard drive
the fonts I used in the template. If you choose the Text tool in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements and start to
edit the text in this file, the program automatically changes the text to a font that’s on your hard drive.You can
then click and drag to select the text and use the options at the top of the workspace to change the font, size,
and color to best suit your design.

142
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
3.
Click anywhere on the template image to make
it active in the workspace. (If the template
image is hidden by the new image, choose
Window➪FrontPage-Template.tif to bring the
template to the front of the workspace before
you paste.) Chose File➪Paste to insert the new
image into the template. After you paste an
image, like this photo, you can click anywhere
within the image and drag to adjust its place-
ment. You can also click and drag a corner to
adjust the size of the image.
2.
You can copy and paste images into this tem-
plate by choosing File➪Open and selecting any
image from your hard drive. In this example, I
opened a photo of a jellyfish, which I want to
use as the big image at the top of this page. To
copy an image into the template, first choose
Select➪All to select the image, and then choose
File➪Copy to copy it.
You can edit the starter images for this site in any image editor that supports layers, including Fireworks,
Photoshop Elements, and Adobe Photoshop CS3, which I used in this exercise.
If the image you’re adding to a template is significantly larger than the template file, resize the new image before
you copy and paste it into the template image.The image size for each image is displayed in the template.You can
change the resolution and dimensions of an image by choosing Image➪Size and adjusting the settings.You can
make minor changes to the size of an image by clicking and dragging any corner of an image after it’s inserted into
the template image. (More detailed instructions for resizing and optimizing images are in Chapter 4.)

5.
To reposition text on the page, click to select
the Move tool from the Toolbox. (In Photoshop,
the Move tool is represented by the double-
headed crossed arrow icon at the top of the
Toolbox. Then click and drag any section of
text. Tip: If you click and drag a corner, you
change the size of the text; if you click in the
middle of a text area and drag, you move it.
4.
To edit the text, select the Text tool
from the Toolbox. Then click and
drag to select the text, and type to
replace it. Use the options at the top
of the workspace to change the font,
size, and color. In this example, I
clicked the color well at the top of
the page to change the text color. To
delete any of the text in the image
template, click and drag to select it
and press the Delete key.
143
Chapter 7: Creating a Business Web Site
6.
Use the three placeholders at the bottom to add
and size three more images, which will serve as
links to other pages in the site after you insert
the images into Dreamweaver. The same tech-
niques you used in Steps 2 through 5 work for
the smaller images; the main difference is that
you size the smaller images to the dimensions
indicated in their respective boxes.
7.
After you make all the changes you want to the
template, you need to save it. Here’s a trick:
Choose Save to save a backup copy of the tem-
plate with your design and then choose Save As
and give the file a new name, to create a copy of
your design. That way, you preserve the design
that you just took such care to create before
you start cutting it up in the steps that follow.
Remember that if you ever want to go back to
the original starter image, you can always
download it again from this book’s companion
Web site.

9.
You can drag the corners of the crop
outline to adjust how the image will
be cropped. To complete the crop,
just double-click in the middle of the
crop area, or click the Cropping tool
again and choose Crop.
8.
The big challenge in designing a
page like this one in Photoshop is
deciding how you want to slice it
into separate images that you can
insert into your Web pages in
Dreamweaver. Photoshop has a
Slice tool, but I prefer to crop out
each part of the image separately so
that I have more control over how I
optimize it during the Save for Web
process. A good place to start crop-
ping is the main image placed at the
top of the page. First choose the
Crop tool from the Toolbox, and
then click and drag to select just
the large image at the top.

145
Chapter 7: Creating a Business Web Site
11. In the Save For Web dialog box,
choose the best file format and
compression settings for your
image. If you’re unsure, see
Chapter 4 for a refresher on when
to save files in GIF, JPEG, or PNG
format and how best to use this
dialog box. After all the settings
are the way you want them, click
OK. In the Save dialog box, give
the image a new name and save it.
When you use the Save for Web
dialog box, you create a copy of
the image in its new, optimized
format. As a result, after you close
the Save for Web dialog box, the
original image remains open and
unchanged in Photoshop. 
10. After you crop out just the banner image, save
it as a new file that you will insert into your
Web page. Choose File➪Save For Web &
Devices.
12. To quickly get back to the completed page design
so that you can crop the next image, choose
Edit➪Undo until you have undone the crop. Now
you’re ready to crop out the next image and
again use the Save for Web dialog box to opti-
mize the image so that you can insert it into the
template, which you do in the following task. If
you can’t undo the crop for any reason, you can
always go back to the backup copy you created
in Step 7.

146
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
In this task, you set up a new Web site using the Jellyfish template and start
customizing the pages.
As you work through the following steps, remember that you can alter this
template a little (by simply adding your own text and images) or you can
alter the design a lot by changing the colors, font options, and other style
settings to make the design more your own.
1.
In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪New Site. In the Site
Definition dialog box, click the Advanced tab. In the Site
Name text box, type a name for your site. In this example,
I entered Jellyfish Template. Click the Browse icon
next to the Local Root Folder text box, and locate on
your hard drive the folder that contains the Jellyfish tem-
plate files. (Note: You can rename the folder.) Click the
Browse icon next to the Default Images folder field, and
select the Images folder in the Jellyfish template folder.
Then click OK. If you haven’t yet selected the Enable
Cache option, a message box appears, asking whether
you want to create a cache for the site. Click Yes to speed
up some of the Dreamweaver display features.

3.
At the top of the home page, you can change
the page title, as I’m doing here, by replacing
the text in the Title field. Include your name or
business name or a brief description to identify
your site, such as I did in this example, with the
words Jelly Rancher, specializing in
jellyfish aquariums. The page title is the
text that appears at the top of the browser
window when a page is viewed online; this text
is saved in a list of sites if someone bookmarks
the page. (In this example, you can see that I
replaced the main graphic at the top of the
page with the large image I cropped out of my
image template in the previous task.)
2.
When you complete the site-setup
process, the files and folders in the
Jellyfish template are displayed in
the Files panel in Dreamweaver, at
the side of the workspace. Double-
click the index.html file to open
the home page in Dreamweaver. (For
more detailed instructions on the
site-setup process, see Chapter 5.)
4.
You can replace any of the image placeholders
with images you prepared in an image editor. To
insert an image, double-click any image place-
holder to open the Select Image Source dialog
box. Alternatively, you can delete any image
placeholder and then select the Insert Image
icon from the Common insert bar, at the top of
the workspace.

148
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
6.
To add or replace other images, select the
image and then follow Steps 5 and 6, selecting
each image from your hard drive in turn to add
to the template. To add a border to an image, as
you see with the three images across the
bottom of this design, enter a number, to repre-
sent pixels, in the Border field. The borders you
see featured in these figures are 2 pixels wide.
5.
In the Select Image Source dialog box, navigate
on your hard drive to find the image you want
to insert, and then double-click the image file-
name to select it. As you see in this example, I’m
now inserting the images that I resized and opti-
mized in the previous task. If the image you
select isn’t already located in your root site,
Dreamweaver offers to copy the file into the
root folder after you select it. If this automated
feature is disabled for some reason, you must
copy the image into the root folder and ensure
that the image path in the Property inspector
reflects that location.
7.
You can add text by typing it into any part of the page.
For example, you can add captions under the photos by
replacing the placeholder text there. Be careful not to
delete the formatting when you delete the holder text. If
you have trouble adding text without altering the
format, use Undo to back up a step and try again.
8.
To change the text size or color in
these captions, you need to edit the
style sheet that controls the design
of this page. To do so, open the CSS
panel (if it’s not open already) by
choosing Window➪CSS Styles. In
this design, the font in the captions
at the bottom of the page is speci-
fied in the style named #Footer. To
change the font face, size, or color,
double-click the style name in the
CSS Styles panel. 

10. To change the layout of the page, you need to change
other styles, such as the height of the mainContent
style, which you find in the Box category in the Style
Definition dialog box. The height of the mainContent
style is set to match the size of the main (top) image in
this example, but you can adjust it if you prefer to use a
smaller image. You can also change the height of the
footer if you want to use larger images or bigger text in
the footer at the bottom of the page. (Tip: You can edit
CSS rules by double-clicking a style name to open it in
the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, or you can edit styles
in the Properties pane, just below the CSS Styles panel,
by clicking a style name once to display its properties
there.)
For more instructions on working with CSS, see Chap-
ter 5. For instructions on how to upload your site to a
Web server, see Chapter 9.
149
Chapter 7: Creating a Business Web Site
9.
In the CSS Rule Definition dialog
box, use the settings in the Type
category to specify how you want
your text to appear on the page.
You can make other changes to
this design by using this same
dialog box to alter the style defini-
tions. For example, you can change
the background color for the entire
page by editing the body style. You
can change the background for the
main design area by changing the
#container style. And, you can
change the background color at
the bottom of the design by alter-
ing the #footer style.
11. To test your work in a Web browser, choose
File➪Preview in Browser and select any browser
on your hard drive. For best results, test your
work in a variety of Web browsers, to ensure
that your pages designs look good for all visi-
tors. In this figure, the page is displayed in
Firefox.

150
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
The Jellyfish template features two designs. The front page design, which is
a simple HTML file, should be edited independently, but all the rest of the
pages in this site were created from a Dynamic Web Template. You can
therefore edit only the main content area of those pages and must edit the
template itself to make changes to the banner or footer area of the pages.
The benefit of this restriction is well worth the extra effort because any
change you make to the template automatically updates all pages created
from the template.
In this task, you learn how to create new pages from a Dynamic Web
Template as well as how to make global changes to those pages by editing
the template file. Before you can complete this lesson, you must complete
the site-setup process in Dreamweaver, covered at the beginning of the pre-
ceding task.
1.
To give you a head start on this Web
site design, the Jellyfish template
folder has several pages that have
already been created and linked
together. You can edit any of these
pages, such as the about.html
page, by simply double-clicking the
name in the Files panel to open it.
It’s common practice to include a
page on your Web site that explains
what the site is about or includes
biographical information about the
site’s creator, like you see in this
figure.

Creating New Pages from a 
Dynamic Web Template
Because the pages in the Jellyfish Template site were created from a Dynamic Web Template, parts of the page
are locked.To change the banner image at the top of the page, or to edit the text, links, or copyright information
at the bottom of the page, you need to edit the Dynamic Web Template file (as you see later in this task).

151
Chapter 7: Creating a Business Web Site
3.
To add a new page to this Web site by using 
the template, choose File➪New. Then, in the
New Document dialog box, choose Page from
Template (from the options on the left), make
sure that the Web site you’re working on is
selected in the middle column, and choose
Jellyfish-template from the right-hand
column. (Notice that a preview of the selected
template is displayed on the far right side of
this dialog box.) Click Create to generate a page
from the template.
2.
Similarly, you can double-click to
open the contact.html file using
the Files panel. To add or edit con-
tact information, just click and
drag to select any text you want to
delete and then type to replace it.
If you need to add a main contact
as well as contact info for your
sales staff, for example, you can
use copy-and-paste to repeat the
text as it’s formatted and then
replace it with your own contact
information.
4.
Before you do anything else, always save the new page
by choosing File➪Save, or press Ctrl+S [in Windows] or
Ô+S [on the Mac]. I named this page aquariums.html.
You need to change the page title by editing the tem-
plate, as you see in a later step.

The image styles in this template
are designed to align an image to
the left or right so that any other
content in the page can wrap
around it, as you see in these fig-
ures. You can alter the image styles
by double-clicking the style name
in the CSS panel and making any
changes you want in the CSS Rules
Definition dialog box.
5.
To replace the image placeholder,
click to select the placeholder,
press the Delete key, and then,
without moving the cursor, choose
Insert➪Image. In the dialog box
that appears, select any image on
your hard drive. To change the
alignment of an image, first click to
select the image. Then, using the
drop-down list in the Class field in
the Property inspector (at the
bottom of the workspace), select
image-right to align an image to
the right, or select image-left to
left-align it.
7.
To add text, simply place your cursor in the area
of the page where you want to add text and then
type to enter it. You can also use the standard
copy-and-paste features to add text from
another file, such as a Microsoft Word document
or a Web page. To change the text color, font, or
size, double-click the Body style in the CSS panel
and specify the options you prefer in the Type
category. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 to create
additional pages from the template.

With the template file open, click to select the
banner image placeholder and delete it by
pressing the Delete key. Then, without moving
the cursor, choose Insert➪Image and select the
image you want to use in its place. In this case,
I replaced the placeholder image with a banner
I created in Photoshop. (You find instructions
for editing a banner image in Chapter 6, and
you find a starter image for this graphic, named
banner.tif, in the Images folder in the
Jellyfish template folder.) Choose File➪Save,
and Dreamweaver automatically offers to
update all pages created from the template.
8.
To edit the template itself, which is how you
can change the banner graphic or alter the links
or copyright information at the bottom of the
page, double-click the name in the Files panel to
open the jellyfish-template.dwt file
located in the Templates folder.

Chapter 7: Creating a Business Web Site
10. You can also make other changes to the tem-
plate file, such as changing the text on the navi-
gation bar at the bottom of the page. To edit the
text, simply click and drag to select each linked
section of text in turn, and replace it by typing
the text you want to use in its place. In this
example, I changed page1 to Jellyfish
Tales.
11. Changing the text links doesn’t alter the file-
names, but you can change those as well by
clicking to select each file in the Files panel and
typing to replace the name. Keep two concepts
in mind when you do this: First, you should
change file or folder names only in the Files
panel, to ensure that Dreamweaver updates the
links, as you see here; second, filenames
shouldn’t include any spaces or special charac-
ters except for the underscore (_) and dash (–).

154
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
13. Always preview your pages in a
Web browser as you’re working on
a Web site, but beware that many
Web browsers don’t display a
Dynamic Web Template. Thus, to
test your work on the template, you
need to open one of the pages you
created from the template and then
choose File➪Preview in Browser
and select a Web browser, such as
Firefox (shown here), from the list.
With a page open in a browser, you
can click the links to test your work.
12. To change, set, or fix links, you
first click and drag to select the
text you want to link (or click to
select an image to use as a link).
Then click the Browse button, to
the right of the Link field in the
Property inspector (it looks like a
yellow folder) and double-click to
choose the name of the file you
want to link to. Again, when you
save the template, Dreamweaver
prompts you to automatically
make the change to all pages cre-
ated from the template.

Chapter 8
Creating a Family, Vacation, 
or Hobby Site
T
here are many excellent reasons to create a family Web site,
slide show, or photo gallery. From the announcement of a new
baby to sharing the latest vacation snapshots, digital designs are a
great way to keep in touch with family and friends.
The best family sites include room for everyone in the clan, and as
you see in the sample family site and lessons in this chapter, you can
easily adapt this design to create sections for each member of your
family, club, or organization.
Getting Started with the Family or 
Group Site Templates
In this chapter, you find templates that can be used in Dreamweaver as well as
starter images designed to be used in an image editor, such as Photoshop or
Fireworks. The sample site created in this chapter is for a family site with separate
pages for each member of a family, but the same templates can be used for any small
organization, group, or business. (Check out the before-and-after shots of this
sample site in the color insert for a quick look at the type of layout you can create.)
These templates are designed to showcase a lot of images and would work well for
an art or photo collection, to illustrate business services or products or to share
photos with family and friends. As you work through the tasks, you find instructions
for changing the names, images, and text in these templates for any kind of site you
want to create.
As you follow the instructions for creating the family site featured in this chapter,
you find out how to customize pages, add or remove pages to accommodate smaller
or larger Web sites, and create advanced features, such as rollover images and image
maps. Because customizing this site involves editing graphics as well as HTML files,
you find separate tasks for each section of the site:


The first task shows you how to customize the banner, text, and images by
using Photoshop Elements. You also find out how to add and position
images to create the page designs for each section of the site.

The second task shows you how to set up a site in Dreamweaver and how to
edit the front page.

The third task covers how to edit Dynamic Web Templates in Dreamweaver,
make changes across many pages at once, set links to pages, create an
image map, and remove pages from the design.

The fourth task features a more-advanced Dreamweaver lesson in how to
create rollover images so that you can create effects, such as the change in
text color of links when a user rolls a cursor over an image and it’s replaced
with another image.
Before you get started with these tasks, here’s a quick overview of the template and
files used in this chapter. To help you get started with this site, and to ensure that
the links on the navigation bars work properly, this template includes starter pages
for each of the main sections of this site. Although you can add or remove pages and
change links as necessary, this list describes the files and folders that get you
started when you first open the Family template:

index.html: This is the name of the front page of the Web site. The main
page of any Web site should be named index; the rest of the pages can 
be named anything you like, as long as you don’t use spaces or special 
characters.

images: You find all template image files in TIFF format in this folder. You
also find optimized JPEG files in the images folder and can use them as you
follow along with the tasks.

css: You find the external style sheets that are attached to the template
files in this folder.

Templates: In this folder, you find the dynamic Web templates used to
create the files in this site.

pages: This folder stores all the pages for the individuals in your site and
includes these ready-to-use pages:
• mom.html: For a parent
• dad.html: For a parent
• child-1.html: For the first child
• child-2.html: For the second child
• child-3.html: For the third child
• child-4.html: For the fourth child
• other.html: For anyone else you want to add, like the aunts and uncles
featured in this example.
You can rename files by using the Dreamweaver Files panel. As you see in Figure 8-1,
the Files panel lists all pages in a Web site; when you make changes in this panel,
Dreamweaver automatically adjusts any corresponding links. If you stick to changing
only filenames or folders in the Files panel, you never have to worry about breaking
links.

Figure 8-1: You start with the general filenames but you can change 
them to reflect family members’ names in the Files panel.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Getting everyone working on your Web site
As you consider all the ways you can share
stories and photos with family members
and friends in your own family Web site,
make sure to include your entire family in
the planning-and-development process.
Here are a few ways you can get family
members of all ages involved:
 Ask older family members to write about
special occasions and family traditions.
 Scan in artwork from younger family
members, and include those images on
the site.
 Invite the family historian to help create
a family tree and other historical records.
 Scan in photos from old photo albums
(and don’t forget to sort through those
boxes of old photos in your attic and
closets).
 Include links to clubs, associations, and
hobby sites, to showcase your family’s
favorite activities.
 Keep the site updated with photos from
everyone in the family, by sharing an
online photo album at Flickr, Shutterfly,
or Kodak Gallery. It’s simple, as I explain
in Chapter 6.

159
Chapter 8: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
Editing Image Templates
These starter images are designed to showcase images, so most of the
work in creating this site is best done in an image program, such as
Photoshop Elements. The trick is to size and prepare all images before
optimizing them and putting the pages together in Dreamweaver. In this
task, you find instructions for adding your own images and text to the
starter images included in the Family template.
This front page starter image has several elements — photos and text —
and it can be altered in many ways. In these steps, you resize and add a
photo and then edit the text by changing its font size, color, and spacing.
After you position and resize all images the way you want, you use the
Save for Web feature to optimize them, to get them ready to insert into the
template files in Dreamweaver.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Launch a graphics program, such as Photoshop
Elements (shown in the figure), choose File➪
Open, and open the template graphic file 
Home-Page-starter image.tif.
You can edit the image templates in any image editor that supports layers, including Adobe Photoshop CS3 and
Photoshop Elements, which is used in this exercise.
If, when you open this starter image, you see the error message Some text layers contain fonts
that are missing, you simply don’t have on your computer’s hard drive the fonts I used in the starter
image. If you choose the Text tool in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements and start to edit the text in this file, the
program automatically changes the text to a font that’s on your hard drive.You can then click and drag to select
the text and use the options at the top of the workspace to change the font, size, and color to best suit your
design. I used the Liorah font in this design.You can purchase and download the font from any number of sites
on the Web; just search for Liorah in any search engine.

160
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
3.
To edit the text in any image in Photoshop
Elements, first click to select the Type tool in
the Toolbox.
2.
This starter image is made up of
many layers, which makes it possi-
ble to edit each piece of text and
delete or replace each image inde-
pendently. You can view a list of
layers by opening the Layers
palette. Choose Window➪Layers
and you see that this template
image has many layers, each named
to correspond to a section of text
or an image in the template. Tip:
Make sure that the Auto Select
Layer check box, at the top of the
workspace, is selected. Then you
can select layers by simply clicking
their contents.
4.
With the Type tool active, click and drag to
select a section of text and then type to replace
the words. (If you’re prompted with the mes-
sage Font substitution will occur, click
OK to continue; Photoshop automatically
changes the text to a similar font on your hard
drive.)

161
Chapter 8: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
6.
To reposition text on the page, click to select
the Move tool from the Toolbox. (In Photoshop
Elements, the Move tool is represented by the
double-headed, crossed arrow icon at the top of
the Toolbox.) Then click and drag any section
of text. Remember: If you click and drag a
corner, you change the size of the text; if you
click in the middle of a text area and drag, you
move the text.
5.
Adjust the Type tool settings on the Options
bar, at the top of the work area, to change the
color, font face, size, or other options. In this
figure, I’m adjusting the font size for the
selected text.
7.
To add a photograph to a layer, you must first
open the photograph as a separate file. While
the starter image is sill open, choose File➪
Open and select any image from your hard
drive. In this example, I opened a photo of a
father and son, which I want to add to the
banner image at the top of the page.

162
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
9.
Choose File➪Paste to insert the new image into
the template. After you paste an image, like this
photo, you can click anywhere within the image
and drag to adjust its placement. You can also
click and drag a corner to change the size of the
image.
8.
To copy an image into the template, first click
anywhere on the image you want to copy, to
make it active in the workspace. Choose
Select➪All to select the image, and then choose
File➪Copy to copy it. Next, click anywhere on
the starter image, to make it active in the work-
space. (If the template image is hidden by the
new image, choose Window➪Home Page Starter
image to bring the file to the front of the work-
space before you paste.)
10. As you add more images, you can adjust the layers by
positioning one image in front of another, which is
important when images overlap or when one image is
obstructed by another. To move one layer in front of
another, right-click and select an option to move the
layer forward or back. To delete an image or text, click
to select it and then press the Delete key.
If the image you’re adding to a starter image is significantly larger than the starter image, resize the new image
before you copy and paste it.You can change the resolution and dimensions of an image by choosing Image➪Size
and adjusting the settings. (You find more detailed instructions for resizing images in Chapter 4.)
You can add as many images as you like, and you can resize them and drag them around the page to change the
layout.The more you alter this design in Photoshop, however, the more you need to alter it in Dreamweaver. For
the purposes of this task, I show you how to edit images into these starter images just as it’s designed so that
you can easily reconstruct them in Dreamweaver.As you get more adept in both Photoshop and Dreamweaver,
however, you can make more elaborate changes.

12. The big challenge in designing a page like this
one in Photoshop is deciding how to save each
of the images as separate files that you can
insert into your Web pages in Dreamweaver. 
A good place to start is the banner. Banners
(including this one) typically appear at the top
of every page in the site, but thanks to the
magic of dynamic Web templates, you need only
one copy of the image. To prepare the banner
image for the Web, first choose the Crop tool
from the Toolbox, and then click and drag to
crop out just the top banner area.
11. After you make all the changes you want to the
starter image, be sure to save your work by
choosing File➪Save. Then save the file again by
choosing File➪Save As and name the new file,
such as My-Family-Front-Page. That way,
you have a backup copy of the design, in case
you ever want to go back to it.
If you ever want to go back to the original
starter image, you can always download
another copy from the Web site.
163
Chapter 8: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
13. You can drag the corners of the crop outline
to adjust how the banner will be cropped. To
complete the crop, just double-click in the
middle of the crop area or click the Crop tool
again and choose Crop.
14. After you crop out just the banner image, it’s a
good idea to save it as a separate file so that
you can easily go back and make changes to it
later, if you want. To do so, first, save the lay-
ered version by choosing File➪Save As and
giving it a new name, such as My Family
Banner.
Remember: Be sure to use Save As to make a
copy of your banner. Doing so preserves all the
work you’ve done on the full page design so
that you can return to that page and crop out
other pieces to use on your Web site.

164
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
16. After all the image settings are the way you want
them, click OK. In the Save dialog box, give the
image a new name and save it.
15. Before you insert an image (like
this banner) into a Web page, you
need to optimize it. Choose File➪
Save for Web, and in the Save for
Web dialog box, choose JPEG from
the Optimized File Format drop-
down list. JPEG format works best
for images that use millions of
colors, such as photographs. 
(For more details about selecting
options in the Save for Web dialog
box, see Chapter 4.)
17. To optimize other images for this
design, open the Family Page tem-
plate again and crop another image
to save for the Web. After you save
all the pieces of the design, you’re
ready to move on to the next task.

Chapter 8: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
Designing a Web Site for the Entire Family
In this task, you set up a new Web site with the Family Web Site template,
which can be used to create any site that features multiple people or sec-
tions. As you work through the following steps, remember that you can
alter this template a little (by simply adding your own text and images) or
alter the design a lot by changing the colors, font options, and other style
settings to make the design more your own.

options in this dialog box alone for now, and
click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box
and save your settings. If you haven’t selected
the Enable Cache check box, a message box
appears, asking whether you want to create a
cache for the site. Click Yes to speed up some of
the Dreamweaver display features.
You can rename the Family Web Site Template folder before or during the site-definition process, but if you
change the name after you complete this site-setup process, you have to complete this step again in
Dreamweaver.

4.
Double-click the index.html file in the Files
panel to open the home page. The home
page of this site is designed to showcase
photos and text created in an image pro-
gram, such as Photoshop Elements. You can
replace any of the image placeholders with
images you’ve prepared for the Web.
3.
When you complete the site-setup process, the files and
folders in the Family Web Site template are displayed in
the Files panel in Dreamweaver, at the side of the work-
space. (For more detailed instructions on the site-setup
process, see Chapter 5.)
5.
At the top of the home page, you can
change the page title by replacing the
text in the Title field. Include your
name or a brief title to identify your
page. (The page title is the text that
appears at the top of the browser
window when a page is viewed
online.)

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Adding Image Maps and Links
If you’re following along from the beginning of this chapter, you should
have already optimized your images in Photoshop Elements and set up the
Family template in Dreamweaver. Now you’re ready to add image maps so
that you can link the names of each family member in the banner image 
to their personal pages, for example. You also set links using text, and you
use the template for personal pages to update all the family pages at once
with the new links.
1.
Open the template family site in Dreamweaver, and open
the Files panel by choosing Window➪Files. Click the
plus sign to open the Templates folder, and then double-
click the Dynamic Web Template named personal-
pages.dwt. All individual family pages in this template
design are created from this Dynamic Web Template.
The main area of the page should be personalized in
each individual page.
2.
The benefit of using this template is that you
can replace the banner graphic at the top of this
page and automatically change it on each indi-
vidual page. To do so, click to select the banner
image and delete it, and then choose Insert➪
Image and select the banner image you created
for your site.

Choose File➪Save, and
Dreamweaver prompts you with a
notice to change all pages that
were created from this template.
Click Update to automatically

by clicking and selecting each name and typing
the name you prefer. You can remove links by
clicking to select the text and pressing the
Delete key.
You can change the name of any of these files in the Files panel, to reflect the name of a family member or the
content of the page.When you change filenames in the Files panel, Dreamweaver automatically updates any
links that correspond to the page.To do so, just click to select the name in the Files panel, type the name that
you want to change it to, and press Enter (or Return).Then click Update when you’re prompted to update the
corresponding pages. Continue until you have renamed all the files.

With an image map tool selected, click and drag
to create a hot spot on the image. In this exam-
ple, I turned the name Kevin into a hot spot that I
can link to the kevin.html page. (If you’re
prompted to describe the image map in the Alt
field, simply type a brief description of the image
map into the Alt field in the Property inspector.)
7.
The image map tools are in the lower-left corner
of the Property inspector. To create an image
map, you first select the shape you want to
create as a “hot spot” on the image. You can
create as many hot spots as you like and link
each one to a separate page in your Web site.
9.
After you create a hot spot, use the
Browse button (the one that looks
like a yellow file folder) in the Link
field in the Property inspector to
link to the corresponding page.
Click to select the Browse button;
then find the file you want to click
to, and double-click to select it.
Dreamweaver automatically sets
the link.
6.
To link the name of each family
member in the banner image to a
different page, you can create an
image map. To do that, click to
select the banner image and in the
Property inspector, click the lower-
right corner to make sure that the
inspector is fully open.

11. With all the links set in the banner
and on the navigation bar at the
bottom of the page, you’re ready to
save the template.
171
Chapter 8: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
10. To create more hot spots, select the
Hotspot tool, click and drag to
create the hot spot on the image,
type a brief description of the
image into the Alt field to serve as
alternate text, and then use the
Browse button to link to the corre-
sponding page. To edit or adjust a
hot spot, click the Pointer Hotspot
tool in the lower-left corner of the
Property inspector. You can then
click and drag the corner of any hot
spot to adjust its size and position.
When you add images or create an image map, it’s always good practice to add a description of the image as
alternate text.This text description appears in a Web page if the image isn’t visible to visitors, and it’s read aloud
to visitors who use special screen reader browsers.You can add alternate text in the Accessibilities Attributes
dialog box or by selecting an image or hot spot and typing it into the Alt field in the Property inspector.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Creating Rollover Images
Rollover images, as their name implies, are designed to react when
someone rolls a cursor over an image. The effect can be as dramatic as
replacing the first image with a completely different one or as subtle as
changing the text color from blue to yellow, for example.
The first step is to create two images that are exactly the same size.
Although they can look completely different, they need to take up the
same amount of space in the Web page so that the rollover works 
properly.
In this task, you discover how to create two images in Photoshop
Elements and use them in a rollover effect in Dreamweaver:
1.
Start by creating (in Photoshop Elements or a similar
program) two images that are the same size. If you’re
using the Family template files, you can start by opening
the file named Rollover-Image.tif in the Images
folder. This image template is designed to create a row of
three rollover images for the front page of the design.

3.
You can replace the text by selecting it and then typing
text in its place. To change the text on both layers, click
to turn each layer on or off in turn by clicking in the
Layer visibility box, just to the left of each layer name in
the Layers palette. The eye icon in the Layer visibility
box indicates that a layer is turned on; if the box is
blank, the layer is turned off. Use the Text tool in the
Toolbox to replace the text, and use the Move tool to
reposition it.
2.
One trick to creating a good rollover image is making
sure that the text and other elements line up properly. In
the template file, you can see that I achieved this goal by
creating two layers (one for each color of text I’m using)
and placing one text layer on top of another. You can
turn layers on and off by clicking in the Layers palette,
and you can identify the layers by their names — For
example, First Child and First Child-2.
4.
Now the trick is to save each section
of the rollover image as a separate
file. Start by cropping out only what
you want in each rollover. In this
example, I’m cropping out just the
first child’s text and photo. (You find
instructions for adding photos to
these templates in the “Editing
Image Templates” task, earlier in
this chapter.)

174
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
6.
Then turn on the layers you want visible when
the rollover image is triggered, and save a
second copy of the image with a different name.
I like to use the numbers 1 and 2 in the names
so that I can easily distinguish between images
when I create the rollover in Dreamweaver in
Step 7.
5.
After the image is cropped, turn on
just the layers you want to appear
when the image is first loaded on
the page: Just click the eye icon to
turn layers on and off. When you
have only the layers you want visi-
ble, choose File➪Save for Web and
optimize the image for the Web.
7.
After the images are prepared,
open Dreamweaver and open the
index.html page, where you set
up the rollover. If you already
added images to the index.html
file, you can simply replace them
with the rollover images you just
created. Start by deleting any
images you want to replace.

9.
In the Insert Rollover Image dialog box, first
give the rollover a name. The name is used in
the script that controls the rollover and must
be one word with no special characters. Next to
the Original Image field, click the Browse button
and select the first image (in this example,
mikayla-1.jpg). Then click the Browse
button next to the Rollover Image field, and
select the second image (in this example,
mikayla-2.jpg).
8.
Click to place the cursor where you want to add
the first rollover image and then choose
Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image.
175
Chapter 8: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
10. In the Alternate Text field, add a name or short
description. Then use the Browse button at the
bottom of the dialog box to select the page the
rollover will link to, by clicking the filename.
Dreamweaver automatically sets the link and
includes the page name in the When Clicked, 
Go to URL field.
11. After you set all options in the dialog box, click
OK. Dreamweaver automatically inserts the
rollover into the page with the first image 
visible.

13. When you view the page in a Web browser, such as
Firefox or Internet Explorer, you can see the rollover
effect in action by rolling your cursor over an image to
reveal the second rollover image in its place.
12. To test the rollover image, preview the page in
a Web browser, by choosing File➪Preview in
Browser or clicking the Preview icon at the top
of the workspace. (It looks like a globe.)
14. As you become more skilled in using the
Dreamweaver behaviors and rollover image fea-
tures, you can change any or all of the images on
a page when you roll a cursor over an image.

Testing and Publishing Your Site
I
t’s a shocking scenario: You work hard to create a page design
that looks just perfect on your own computer, you publish it on
the Internet and tell all your friends, and the next thing you know,
your cousin in Iowa and your friends in Brazil are telling you that it
looks terrible and the links are broken, and they don’t know why
you’re wasting your time on all this crazy Web stuff. Don’t let this
happen to you. No matter how carefully you build your Web site,
take some time to test your work before you publish the site for the
entire world to see.
Before you “go live” with your site, it’s a relatively simple step to use
the many Dreamweaver testing features to ensure that all your links
and other features work properly, by following the step-by-step
instructions in this chapter. You should also preview your pages in a Web browser —
or two or three — to make sure that your site looks the way you intend in the many
different browsers now in use on the Internet.
In the first part of this chapter, you find detailed instructions for previewing pages
and using the Dreamweaver testing tools. In the last part of the chapter, you find out
how to use the built-in Dreamweaver File Transfer Protocol (FTP) features to copy
your Web site from your hard drive to a Web server on the Internet.
If you’re looking for information about Web-hosting services and domain registration
sites, you find in Chapter 2 some recommendations and tips for choosing a Web
hosting service and registering a domain name.
Understanding How and Why Browsers
Affect a Site’s Appearance
One of the more confusing and frustrating aspects of Web design is that you can
create a page design that looks good in Dreamweaver and then test it in a browser
(like Internet Explorer, or IE), to confirm that it looks fine — only to discover later
that it looks terrible in a different browser, such as Firefox or Safari.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
There are many reasons why Web pages can look different from one browser to
another, but it boils down to this: Browsers display Web pages differently because
HTML and other Web technologies have evolved dramatically over the years, and
not all browser makers have designed their programs to display Web design fea-
tures, such as HTML and CSS, in exactly the same way.
Dozens of browsers are now in use on the Web, not counting the different versions of
each browser. For example, at the time of this writing, Internet Explorer 7 is the
newest release from Microsoft, but a significant percentage of Web users haven’t yet
upgraded and are still using IE 6 or even earlier versions. Similarly, browser compa-
nies such as Firefox and Safari have now created a number of versions that are still
in use on the Web. As newer versions of these browsers are released, the way they
display HTML and other Web technologies changes.
Add to that the differences between Macintosh and Windows computers, which can
also affect the way Web pages appear. For example, the same font size generally
looks smaller on a Macintosh than on a PC, and image colors can vary from one com-
puter to another. And, as you might imagine, the Web pages look quite different on a
21-inch monitor than they do on a 15-inch monitor.
The result is that the same Web page can look significantly different to the many
people who visit a Web site. For example, Figures 9-1 and 9-2 shown here represent
the same Web page displayed in Internet Explorer 7 and in Firefox 2. The kinds of dif-
ferences you see in these two browsers can become even more pronounced in even
older browsers or in monitors of different sizes.
Figure 9-1: This page looks just as I intended it to in Internet Explorer, but I have to test it 
in more browsers to make sure it will look good to everyone who visits this site.

179
Chapter 9: Testing and Publishing Your Site
Figure 9-2: In Firefox, the second column falls beneath the first because the two browsers 
don’t display CSS in exactly the same way. By making a few minor adjustments, 
I made the page look good in both browsers.
This challenging aspect of Web design is at the root of many of the limitations and
complications of creating Web sites that look good to everyone who may visit your
pages. HTML was designed to help ensure that Web pages look good on every com-
puter on the planet, and as a result, some of the rules of Web design may seem
strange or limiting at first. Despite these efforts and a growing movement toward
more standardized Web development, getting your pages to look exactly the same
on every computer on the planet is difficult to impossible. As a result, most design-
ers create pages that look as good as possible on as many browsers as they consider
important, even if the same pages don’t look exactly the same on all browsers.
Which browsers you should design for depends on your audience. If you have the
luxury of having accurate reports on the visitors to your site, you can see a list of all
of the browsers used by visitors to your site. (You can find in Chapter 14 two excel-
lent Web-statistic services that include browser-usage information.) For example,
your Web statistics may reveal that 40 percent of your audience uses IE 7; 20 percent
uses IE 6; 5 percent uses IE 5; 30 percent uses Firefox; and 5 percent uses Safari. With
those numbers in mind, you may decide that your pages should look attractive in
Internet Explorer 6 and 7 and Firefox but settle for them not looking quite as good in
Safari and older versions of IE, which display some features quite differently.
Entire books and Web sites are dedicated to the differences among browsers, and
how to best design for everyone on the Web. To help keep things simpler for you, I
include templates in this book that are designed to look best in the most-recent and
most-commonly used browsers on the Web, including Internet Explorer 5 and 6, and
Firefox 1 and 2. However, you should note that making significant changes to these
designs may result in unpredictable results, which is another important reason to
test your work thoroughly before you publish your site.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Previewing Web Pages in Multiple Browsers
Previewing your Web pages in a variety of Web browsers is the simplest
way to make sure that they look suitable to most of your visitors. The
following task walks you through the process of adding browsers to
Dreamweaver for easy previewing and for viewing the same Web page
in multiple browsers.
1.
Open a Web page that you want to preview 
in Dreamweaver, choose File➪Preview in
Browser, and select a Web browser from the
list of browser options. (You find out how 
to add more browsers to this list in Steps 3
and 6.)
2.
Study the page carefully, and test links,
rollovers, and any other special effects to make
sure that the page appears the way you want in
the Web browser.

4.
In the (Preview in Browser) Preferences dialog
box, click the plus (+) sign at the top of the
dialog box to open the Add Browser dialog box.
Enter a name for the browser. (I like to include
the version number as well as the name, as 
I have here, with Firefox 2.) Click the Browse
button.
3.
Return to Dreamweaver to make any changes
you want to the page and to test the same page
in other Web browsers. To add browsers to the
preview list, choose File➪Preview in Browser
and then select Edit Browser List.
6.
Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to add more browsers
to the list. You can then designate which
browser you want as your primary browser, the
browser that will be launched when the F12 key
is first pressed. Note that you can also desig-
nate a secondary browser, which appears
second on the list and will launch and display
the same Web page if you press the F12 key
twice.
5.
Find on your hard drive the browser you want
to add, click to select it, and then click Open 
to add it to the browser list in Dreamweaver.
Note that you can only add browsers to
Dreamweaver that are on your hard drive. 
(See the nearby sidebar “Downloading new
browsers” to find out more about finding and
downloading new browsers for testing.)

182
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
8.
In addition to any browsers you
add to the preview list, note that
you can choose to preview your
pages in Dreamweaver’s Device
Central, which emulates a variety of
cellphones and other handheld
devices. Device Central is a new
feature in Dreamweaver version
CS3. (You don’t have this option if
you’re using an older version of
Dreamweaver.) You can preview 
the same page in many different
devices by first clicking the plus
sign next to the device type and
then any of the devices listed
within each group.
7.
You can also preview a page in a
browser by clicking the
Preview/Debug in Browser icon (it
looks like a globe), at the top of the
workspace, and selecting any
browser from the list.
Downloading new browsers
How do you put new browsers on your hard
drive so that you can preview your pages
with them? The simplest way to get the
latest versions is to visit the Web sites of the
companies that create the most popular
browsers:
Microsoft 
Internet 
Explorer: 
www.
microsoft.com/ie
Mozilla Firefox: www.firefox.com
Apple Safari (Mac only): www.apple.com/
safari
For older browser versions and more
obscure browsers, check out http://
browsers.evolt.org/, a browser archive
created and maintained especially for Web
designers.

183
Chapter 9: Testing and Publishing Your Site
Using the Dreamweaver Link Testing Features
Test, test, and test some more. To help you ensure that all the bells and
whistles on your Web site ring and ding the way they should, a variety of
Dreamweaver features makes it easy to test your pages for broken links and
other potential problems. In the task that follows, you find instructions for
using some of these high-powered testing tools on a completed Web page.
Toolbox:
 Adobe Dreamweaver
 A Web site with linked
pages
Time needed:
About half an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Make sure that the site you want to test is selected and active
in the Files panel. If you haven’t yet completed the site setup
process, see Chapter 5 to take care of this important initial step.
2.
To test the links in a Web site, choose
Site➪Check Links Sitewide. (Note that no
page in the Web site has to open for this 
feature to work.)

184
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
4.
You can fix broken links in a number
of ways; the simplest is to reset the
link by following the same steps you
find in Chapter 5 for creating links.
In the example shown here, where
I’m fixing a link from one page in a
Web site to another page in the
same site (an internal link), start
by making sure that the linked text
is selected and then use the Browse
button (the yellow file folder next
to the Link field) in the Property
inspector to locate the correct
filename. 
3.
The report from the Check Links
feature is displayed at the bottom
of the workspace. If Dreamweaver
reports a broken link, like the one
shown here (to the file cry.html),
double-click the filename, and
Dreamweaver highlights the corre-
sponding text or image with the
broken link so that you can easily
see where you need to fix the link.
5.
Use the Show drop-down list shown
here to view all the orphaned files
in a site. Orphaned files are HTML
files that aren’t linked or images
and multimedia files that aren’t
inserted into any page. You also
display a list of external links (links
to sites outside this site) so that
you can test them to make sure
that the Web site address hasn’t
changed. Note that external links
can be checked only when a page
is previewed in a browser on a
computer with an active Internet
connection.

185
Chapter 9: Testing and Publishing Your Site
Setting Up FTP in Dreamweaver
Okay, you created a Web site and tested it, and you’re ready to upload it to
the Web. It’s time to put the Dreamweaver publishing tools to work. If
you’re using a commercial service provider, you most likely need the
Dreamweaver FTP features, covered in detail in this task and the remaining
tasks in this chapter.
Note that you must complete the site-setup process, covered in the begin-
ning of Chapter 5, before you can configure the site for uploading. You also
need the following information from your Web hosting service (find tips for
choosing a Web host in Chapter 2):

The FTP host name

The path to the Web directory (optional but useful, and
should look similar to this: /web/htdocs/jcwarner)

An FTP login or user name

An FTP password
After you gather all your FTP information and complete the site setup,
you’re ready to access the Dreamweaver publishing tools and prepare the
program to upload your Web site. In this task, you set up Dreamweaver to
connect to your server via FTP, a process you need to do only once for
each site you work on. In the next task, you use Dreamweaver to upload
pages to your server by using the connection you establish in this task.
Follow these steps:
Toolbox:

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Choose Site➪Manage Sites to open the Manage Sites dialog box.
Alternatively, you can choose Manage Sites from the bottom of the
Site drop-down list in the Files Panel, as shown in this figure.

186
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
3.
Select the Advanced tab from the top of the Site
Definition dialog box, and then select the Remote
Info category from the left side.
2.
In the list of defined sites, select the site you want to
publish and then click the Edit button.
4.
Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the
Access box, and then select the publishing
option best suited to your Web server and
development environment. If you’re using a
commercial Web host (the most common
option for small do-it-yourself sites), choose
FTP. If you’re working at a university, a large
company, or an organization that has its own
Web servers, refer to the nearby sidebar, “The
multiple Dreamweaver publishing options,” to
understand your choices here, and check with
your system administrator to find out which
option is best for your system.

5.
In the FTP Host text box, type the host name 
of your Web server. In my example, I used
ftp.digitalfamily.com. In the Host
Directory text box, type the directory on the
remote site in which documents visible to 
the public are stored. In my example, I used
/web/digitalfamily/. The information you
enter in this field depends on your server. In
some cases, you can leave the field blank if you
log in directly to your site; in other cases, you
use a different path, such as users/mysite/
domain. Check with your service provider or
site administrator to find out how your server
is set up.
187
Chapter 9: Testing and Publishing Your Site
6.
Enter your login name and password. Web services require a username
and password to gain access to your Web server, to ensure that you’re
the only person who can make changes to your Web site. If you select
the Save check box, Dreamweaver stores the information on your local
computer and you don’t have to retype it every time you log in to your
Web server. Click the Test button to make sure that you entered every-
thing correctly. If there are no problems, Dreamweaver responds with
the message Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 connected to your Web
server successfully.
7.
Select the Use Passive FTP option or the Use
Firewall option only if your service provider or
site administrator instructs you to do so. If you
a use a commercial Web-hosting service, you
shouldn’t need to select any remaining options
in this section of the dialog box. Select Use
Secure FTP if you have a secure Web server,
but be aware that not all hosts support secure
FTP. If you select this option and see an error
message when you press the Test button, dese-
lect the option and test again.
If you try to connect to your server and see the message “An FTP error occurred,” it usually means that you
entered characters incorrectly. Be very careful as you type your username, password, and other information,
because most servers are case sensitive and require that these fields be filled in with the exact host, directory,
login, and password information. If you still have trouble, contact your service provider or site administrator to
ensure that you have all the correct information for connecting to your server. Setting up all this information cor-
rectly the first time can be tricky, and each service provider is different.

188
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
9.
Click OK to save your Web server information settings and close
the Site Definition dialog box. You’re ready to start using the
Dreamweaver FTP features, covered in the next section.
8.
Click to select the Maintain Synchronization
Information check box; Dreamweaver then
automatically keeps track of any changes you
make to pages on your local computer that
haven’t been uploaded to the server. Note:
I never recommend that you select the
Automatically Upload Files to Server on Save
check box because I think that you should test
your pages on your local computer before you
publish them to the local site. Leaving this box
deselected prevents the possibility of acciden-
tally uploading errors automatically every time
you save a page on your local computer. The
Enable File Check In and Check Out option
opens an advanced feature that can be used to
track files when multiple people are working on
a Web site. You can find more information on
this and other site-management features in my
book Dreamweaver CS3 For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing).
The multiple Dreamweaver publishing options
In the Remote Info category of the Site
Definition dialog box, you find five options
when you click the Access drop-down list.
The following list briefly describes when
you should select each choice. (If you’re
using a commercial Web-hosting service,
the FTP option should be your best choice.)
 None: When you aren’t uploading your
site to a server or when you aren’t yet
ready to fill in these settings.
 FTP: When you’re using the built-in
Dreamweaver File Transfer Protocol fea-
tures, which are covered in detail in the
following section. You’re most likely to
need these settings if you’re using a
commercial Web-hosting service.
 Local/Network: When you’re using a
Web server on a local network, such as
your company or university server. For
specific settings and requirements, check
with your system administrator.
 WebDAV 
(Web-based 
Distributed
Authoring and Versioning): When you’re
using a server with the WebDAV proto-
col, such as Microsoft IIS.
 RDS (Remote Development Services):
When you’re using ColdFusion on a
remote server.
 Microsoft Visual SourceSafe:When you’re
using Microsoft Visual Source Safe. (This
option is available only in Windows.)

189
Chapter 9: Testing and Publishing Your Site
After you enter all your Web server and login information into Dreamweaver
(as you do in the previous task), you can upload files to your server and
retrieve them at any time by using the built-in FTP capabilities of
Dreamweaver.
To transfer files between your hard drive and a remote server, follow these
steps:
Toolbox:
 Adobe Dreamweaver
 A Web site with linked
pages
 Access to a Web server
Time needed:
About half an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Make sure that the site you want to
upload is selected and visible in the
Files panel and that you entered all
the FTP settings described in the pre-
vious section. Then, in the upper-left
corner of the Files panel, click the
Connects to Remote Host icon. (It
looks like a plug and an outlet.)
If you’re not already connected to the Internet, the Connects to Remote Host icon attempts to start your Internet
connection. If you have trouble connecting this way, try establishing your Internet connection as usual to check
e-mail or surf the Web, and then return to Dreamweaver and click the Connects to Remote Host icon after estab-
lishing your Internet connection.When your computer is online, Dreamweaver should have no trouble automati-
cally establishing an FTP connection with your host server.
Uploading Files with the Dreamweaver 
FTP Features

190
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
3.
To see both Local and Remote views
simultaneously, expand the Files
panel by clicking the Expand icon,
in the upper-right corner of the Files
panel. With the panel expanded, you
can upload and download files by
dragging them from one pane to the
other. To minimize the Files panel,
click the same icon again. In this
figure, the Files panel is expanded
and the cursor is hovering over the
icon, which is labeled Collapse
when the Files panel is expanded.
2.
When the connection is established, the blue Connects
to Remote Host icon changes to look like the plugs are
connected (or, dare I say, plugged in). After the connec-
tion is established, you can view the files and folders on
your Web server by choosing Remote View from the
drop-down list in the upper-right corner. (It’s shown
open in this figure.) Using the drop-down arrow, you can
easily switch between Local view, which displays the
files and folders in the root site folder on your local hard
drive, and Remote view, by selecting each one in turn.
4.
To upload a file (transfer a file from
your hard drive to your Web
server), select the file from the
Local View panel (which displays
the files on your hard drive) and
click the Put Files icon (the up
arrow) in the Files panel. If a dialog
box appears with the message Put
dependent files, choose No, to
upload only the selected file.
Choose Yes, and Dreamweaver
uploads the selected file, plus any
files that appear within that file,
such as images or multimedia files
that are inserted into a page.

191
Chapter 9: Testing and Publishing Your Site
6.
To download files or folders (trans-
fer files or folders from your Web
server to your hard drive), select
the files or folders from the Remote
Site panel (which displays the files
on your server) and click the Get
Files button (the down arrow) in
the Files panel.The files are auto-
matically copied to your hard drive
when you transfer them.
5.
Files are copied to your server 
when you transfer them, leaving 
the file on the local computer
untouched. You can select multiple
files or folders to be transferred 
simultaneously.
When you copy files to or from your server, the files you’re transferring overwrite the files already at the destina-
tion. Dreamweaver notifies you about the overwriting if it notices that you’re replacing a newer version of a file
with an old one, but it’s always a good idea to double-check before you overwrite a file.
After you upload files to your server, test your work by using a Web browser to view the pages online. Sometimes,
things that look and work fine on your computer don’t work on the server, so you should always test the pages
on the server right away.
Using dedicated FTP programs
If you prefer to use a dedicated FTP program
rather than the built-in Dreamweaver fea-
tures, you can download one of these pop-
ular FTP programs for the Mac or PC:
 FireFTP: A Firefox add-on that you can
download for free from fireftp.
mozdev.org.
 WS_FTP: On a PC, you can find this 
program with the unusual name at
www.ipswitch.com.
 CuteFTP: Download this Windows pro-
gram from www.cuteftp.com.
 Fetch: If you use a Macintosh computer,
check out this program, available at
www.fetchsoftworks.com.
 Transmit: You can download this pro-
gram, also for the Mac, at www.panic.
com/transmit.

192
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Synchronizing Local and Remote Sites
One of the most valuable features in the Dreamweaver FTP options is the
capability to automatically synchronize the files on your hard drive with
the files on your Web server. This feature is cool because it helps you keep
track of which pages you edited and ensures that they were updated on the
server.
This feature may not matter much to you the first time you upload your
site, or if you have only a few pages in your site, but if you have a large site
and make frequent updates, this feature is a wonderful way to ensure that
all your changes reach your server. You can easily forget a file when you’re
making several updates at once. Dreamweaver also confirms which files are
updated after you complete the synchronization.
Follow these steps to synchronize your Web site:
1.
Make sure that the site you want to work on is selected
in the Files panel and connected to the server. (See the
previous two tasks for instructions on these preliminary
steps.) Click the Expand/Collapse icon to enlarge the
Files panel and view the remote and local sites simulta-
neously. (To minimize the Files panel, click the Expand/
Collapse icon again.)

Make sure that the Delete Remote Files Not
on Local Drive check box is deselected. Be
careful: I generally recommend that you leave
this check box deselected because you may
have folders and files on the server, such as
log files or program files that don’t exist on
your hard drive, that you don’t want to
delete inadvertently.
2.
Choose Site➪Synchronize or click the
Synchronize icon (the double-headed circular
blue arrow), and the Synchronize Files dialog
box opens. In the Synchronize drop-down list,
choose either the Entire Site or Selected Files
Only option. In the Direction drop-down list,
choose which option you want to use to copy
the files. This list describes the options:
•
Put Newer Files to Remote: Copies the most
recently modified files from your local site to
the remote site. Select the Delete Remote Files
Not on Local Drive check box if you want those
files removed from your Web site.
•
Get Newer Files from Remote: Copies the most
recently modified files from your remote site to
the local site. Select the Delete Local Files Not
on Remote Server check box if you want to
remove those files from your local copy.
•
Get and Put Newer Files: Updates both the local
and remote sites with the most recent versions
of all the files and folders.
4.
Click the Preview button, and
Dreamweaver automatically com-
pares the files on your local hard
drive with the ones on the remote
server. When the comparison is
complete (it can take several sec-
onds), the Synchronize dialog box
displays any files that Dreamweaver
has identified and indicates whether
they need to be uploaded or down-
loaded (in keeping with the options
you specified in Step 3). Use the
icons in the lower-left corner of this
dialog box to change any of the pro-
posed Dreamweaver actions. Click
OK, and Dreamweaver automatically
transfers files and then updates the
Synchronize dialog box with the
status of the process.

Designing a Blog
B
logging is a hot technology. All the fanciest Web sites are
parading around in permalinks and comments, and for good
reason: Blogs have proven to be exceptionally successful at gener-
ating interest and traffic to a Web site, and in making interesting
connections with readers.
All kinds of people are choosing to start a blog, too. No matter what
you read in the newspaper, blogs are being created by more than
just teenagers. Top-level executives at General Motors are using a
blog to connect vice presidents with buyers of Chevy Camaros (visit
fastlane.gmblogs.com). Staff members of Mäni’s Bakery in Los
Angeles keep their customers up-to-date on the latest soup specials
with their blog at www.manisbakery.com. Smart and funny indi-
vidual bloggers have readers they have never met — check out Joey Devilla’s mus-
ings on his blog, The Adventures of Accordion Guy in the Twenty-First Century
(joeydevilla.com).
For all the talk about blogs, the word blog is about as clear as mud, so perhaps a defi-
nition is in order. A blog (short for Web log) is a collection of writings or multimedia
content, displayed in reverse chronological order, sorted by category and date, that
offers readers the ability to leave comments for the writer or for other readers. Blogs
are essentially a flavor of Web site, but one that’s quite standardized in the way it’s
presented, and used by all kinds of people to discuss an amazing range of topics.
Blogs are a useful way to encourage dialogue on your Web site and to build commu-
nity. (It’s a hot topic in today’s Web 2.0 world.) Most Web site owners love the idea of
creating a group of loyal visitors, and I would bet you’re no different! This chapter
shows you the options that are available if you want to blog, by focusing on using a
popular and free service from Blogger.com. You find out how to set up your account,
post entries, customize the blog’s look and feel, and even integrate your blog
directly into your Web site.

or know what they do in the first place? Although I can’t help you with your
function keys, blogging software is another matter: One of the quickest and
most flexible services is available at Blogger.com. Blogger’s free and robust
blogging tool includes some nice bells and whistles. You can sign up and
get started very quickly.
If you aren’t sure that you want to blog or you’re thinking of using other
software down the road (or you’re just curious), Blogger.com is also an
excellent place to become familiar with how blogging software works.
In this step-by-step task, you can see how easy it is to sign up for a blog and
get started:
1.
Open your Web browser, point it to www.
blogger.com, and click the Create Your Blog
Now button.
2.
Type your e-mail address in the Email Address
field, and then type it again in the Retype Email
Address field. Type a password in the Enter a
Password field, and then type it again in the
Retype Password field to confirm it. The
password-strength indicator tells you how
secure your password is — that is, how easily
someone else might be able to guess it. Click
the Password Strength link to read about
making your password harder for others to
figure out.

In the Word Verification field, type the funny-
looking letters you see. The Word verification
technique is used on many Web forms to
ensure that a human, rather than a computer
script, is filling out the form. Many spammers
set up scripts to fill out Web forms in order to
display spam messages on blogs or send them
by e-mail.
5.
Click to select the Terms of Service check box,
to indicate your compliance with the Blogger
terms of service, and then click Continue. You
should always know what you’re agreeing to,
so click the Terms of Service link to read the
Blogger rules. After you click Continue, the
screen that allows you to name your blog loads.
6.
Give your blog a name in the Blog Title field.
Blog names are generally short and catchy. The
key is to make it memorable for readers. If you
aren’t sure yet what to name your blog, don’t
worry: You can change the name later.
8.
In the Word Verification field, type — again! —
the funny-looking letters you see. (Those spam-
mers are persistent.) When you’re done, click
the Continue button to display the final setup
screen, where you choose a template for your
blog.
7.
Choose the URL (Web address) for your blog
and type it in the Blog Address field. Click the
Check Availability link to see whether the blog
address you want to use is available; Blogger
suggests alternatives if the name you want to
use is taken.
9.
Scroll through the available designs to find one
that appeals to you. When you find one, click to
select the radio button below it and then click
Continue. If you want to see a bigger version of
the template, click the Preview Template link
below the thumbnail version you’re interested
in. A larger version of the template opens in a
separate window. Simply close the window
when you’re finished. You can change your tem-
plate later, if necessary. After you sign up for a
blog, you’re ready to start posting. See the next
task for details.

Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Blogger is part of the family of Web services made available by Google. If you have an account with another
Google application, like Gmail, you can use it when you sign up for Blogger. If you have a Google account and
Blogger recognizes that you do, some of the fields mentioned in these steps are already filled out for you. If you
sign in with a Google account, start with Step 6 to create a blog.
Blogging software options
I talk extensively about Blogger in this chap-
ter, but it is by no means the only, or even
the best, blogging solution out there. If a
blog is an important part of your Web plans,
spend some time researching the available
solutions to find the one that fits both your
plans and your pocketbook.
Because Blogger is hosted blog software,
you use its Web servers to publish and store
your blog. Some software packages, how-
ever, can be installed directly on your own
Web server, giving you more control and
better ability to customize. Hosted solutions
are fast and easy to use, and installed solu-
tions offer more features and better control.
Here are two other hosted solutions you can
take a look at:
TypePad, at www.typepad.com, has three
pricing levels, depending on the level of
functionality you want, and it’s proving to be
the platform of choice for busy profession-
als who want the convenience of a hosted
service with more support and a larger fea-
ture set.
WordPress is a recent addition to the hosted
software family. Like Blogger, it’s free, and
although it’s quite easy to use, it doesn’t yet
have the level of template customization
that Blogger offers. Sign up for WordPress
at www.wordpress.com.
If you want to install software on your own
Web server, here’s a description of the major
players:
Movable Type is the granddaddy of blogging
software, the gold standard to which all
others are compared. It has tons of helpful
features, and if you develop the proper
skills, you can make this software jump
through hoops for you. Check it out at
www.movabletype.com.
WordPress is the one that lots of bloggers
swear by (the version you can install on
your own server as opposed to the hosted
version). They point out that you can’t beat
the features it offers for the price. This soft-
ware is free. It’s open source, so if you want
to dig into the guts of your code, this
excellent choice is available at www.word
press.org.
ExpressionEngine has its roots in blogging
software but is evolving into a fully featured
content-management system with excellent
blogging tools. Throw in extras like photo
galleries, shopping cart modules, forums,
polls, and more, and you can use this prod-
uct to run your blog and the rest of your Web
site. It’s at www.expressionengine.com. 
I mention only six blogging options here,
but you can check out dozens, including
many on social networking sites like
MySpace. Take a good look at your options
as you make your decision to find just the
right set of features for your situation.

Chapter 10: Designing a Blog
Posting to Your Blog
Updates to your blog are usually called posts, or entries. Blog posts are gen-
erally short (although they don’t have to be) and can be composed directly
in the blogging software or written in more traditional word processing
software and then pasted into the composition window. (For advice on cre-
ating a readable, interesting blog post, read the following sidebar, “Writing
for your blog.”)
Nearly all blogging software works similarly to word processing software,
or even e-mail software. After typing an entry, you can use handy icons in
the publishing interface to create text styles. Blog software also has icons
you can click to accomplish simple HTML tasks, like inserting links.
Creating a new post is easy to do. In fact, if you can write an e-mail mes-
sage, you can write a blog post! Follow these steps:
Toolbox:
 An updated Web
browser, such as
Internet Explorer 7.0 or

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Log in to your blog at www.blogger.com. You
can have multiple blogs at the same time with
Blogger. When you log in to your account, all
your blogs are visible in the Dashboard, and
each blog you write has a New Post link. Click
the New Post link below the name of the blog
you’re updating, to open the Posting tab for that
blog.
2.
Type a title for your blog post in the
Title field. Type the text of your
blog post on the Compose tab,
using the formatting icons to
choose fonts, create lists and links,
and create other layout styles. To
apply formatting to the text, first
select the text you want to affect,
and then click the icon for the style
you want to apply. You can choose
font options, bold, italics, text
color, text alignment, bulleted or
numbered lists, and more.

4.
To insert an image into your blog entry, click
the Add Image icon (it looks like a tiny picture
of a mountain) to open the Upload Images
window. You can choose from a handful of
methods. (To find out how to prepare images
for use on the Web, read Chapter 4.) You can
either choose an image on your computer and
upload it or provide the Web address (URL) for
an image that is on another Web site. Either
way, Blogger also lets you choose a layout and
an image size.
3.
To add a link, first select the text that you want
readers to click to find the link. Then simply
click the Link icon (the globe with a link of
chain on top of it) and paste the Web address
for the link into the URL window that opens.
Don’t forget that you need to use the full URL,
including the http:// part, to create a work-
ing link.
5.
You can also add labels to your blog post. Labels, or keywords
that describe the blog post, are used by search engines to
better sort your content into search result listings. To add a
label, simply type it in the Labels for This Post box, in the
lower-right corner of the window.
6.
Click the Check Spelling icon (it looks like a
check mark on top of the letters ABC) to high-
light in yellow all spelling errors in your blog
post. Click any error to select from a list of
corrections.

8.
Click the Post Options link, on the left, to set
the date and time of your post, and to turn
commenting on or off. For most blog posts, you
should leave comments turned on.
7.
Before you post your entry, click
the Preview link, in the upper-right
corner, to see how your chosen
styles look. You can return to
Editing mode by clicking Hide
Preview. If you decide, after pre-
viewing, to remove formatting,
simply highlight any element with a
style you want to remove and click
the Remove Formatting icon. 
(It looks like an eraser.)
203
Chapter 10: Designing a Blog
9.
When everything looks right, click the Publish
Post button. The system then confirms that
your post has been published. If you want to
save your post as a draft for later, you can
click Save rather than Publish. (Lots of blog-
gers do this in order to have material prepared
ahead of time or just to have the chance to
read things over one more time.) Blogger also
saves your work automatically every few min-
utes, so if the Save button says Saved, you
already have a draft version. After you publish
your post, click the View Blog link to ensure
that your post was published successfully and
looks the way you want.
Chances are you discovered quite a bit of HTML in the other chapters of this book. If you feel comfortable using
HTML, you can use it right in the blog post window of Blogger. (As with regular text, you can write HTML
directly in the window, or create your code in another application and copy and paste it into the blog post
window.) If you want to use code, click the Edit Html tab of the composition window to switch modes.

204
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
After your blog is up and running, you can make updates by using e-mail. Updating in this way requires one
quick setup step: From the Blogger Dashboard, click the Settings link and then click the Email link. In the Mail-
to-Blogger Address area, fill in the blank to create a custom e-mail address that’s associated with your blog.
Make it something easy to remember. Select the Publish check box if you want messages you send by e-mail to
be posted automatically, and click the Save Settings button to save your changes. If you don’t select the Publish
check box, you can still send updates by e-mail — they’re saved in draft form until you specify from the
Dashboard to publish them.When setup is complete, simply type the e-mail address you just set up, choose a
title by typing it in the Subject field, and then create a blog post in the body of your message.When you click
Send, the message wings its way to Blogger and onto your blog.
Writing for your blog
Blog style is generally conversational and
informal in tone and style. You should
address the reader directly, to play up this
aspect of blogging, almost as though you’re
talking to a good friend on the phone or
writing an e-mail message.
I don’t mean that you have to throw out the
rules of grammar and spelling, although
many bloggers do so. You’ll find that many
readers appreciate carefully crafted sen-
tences when they read blogs as much as
they do when they read books. Why make
yourself hard to understand?
Many writing coaches say that being rigor-
ous about spelling and grammar is a good
way to sharpen your thinking. And, of
course, it’s true — the more attention to pay
to writing well, the better your results, even
if you’re just blogging about the terrific play
you saw last night.
For a helpful example of a writing style 
that works well on a blog, visit the site 
named “The Pioneer Woman Cooks!”
(www.thepioneerwomancooks.com), 
a
blog that’s entertaining and informative.
This excerpt from Ree’s blog (she’s a self-
proclaimed “desperate housewife”) hits just
the right combination of casual good humor
and well-crafted thought:
Sigh. Tiramisu. The first time I tried it was
back when I lived in L.A., and it happened to
also be the first time I tried risotto. I was
having dinner with my L.A. boss, her boss
from Connecticut, and my four other cowork-
ers. The risotto experience was triumphant
enough — the creamy, al dente deliciousness
of each bite just about did me in. But then the
Connecticut boss took the liberty of ordering
a round of Tiramisu for the table . . . and my
life has never been the same. I mean that,
too. It changed instantly and was forever
altered. But in a really good way.
Incidentally, Ree does more than write in her
blog posts: Each recipe that she posts is
extensively illustrated with photographs of
every step (sort of like this book!). Don’t
forget that blogging doesn’t have to mean
all writing, all the time. Many terrific blogs
are devoted to displaying a photograph
every day, or to video blogging. Numerous
others combine text, photos, audio, and
video, which keeps them fun and interesting
for readers — and for the blogger.

Chapter 10: Designing a Blog
Customizing Your Blog Design
One exciting feature of Blogger is the flexibility to tweak and customize
the blog template. You spend a lot of time trying to make your words
reflect your thoughts and feelings; why not make the blog itself more
personal?
When you started your blog, you chose a template design, but you
don’t have to keep it forever. You can change to a new template when-
ever you feel like it, and you can tweak one of the many templates by
changing elements such as text and link colors, adding photos, and
even repositioning elements on the page.
You can easily spend a lot of time tweaking colors, for example, to get
them just right (I have spent hours trying one color and then another),
but don’t forget that the templates in the system were all designed by
professionals. If you like what you see, you don’t have to tweak!
If you just can’t resist the temptation to customize your site, here’s how
to get started:
Toolbox:
 An updated Web
browser, such as
Internet Explorer 7.0 or
Firefox 2.0
 A blog on Blogger.com
Time needed:
Half an hour to an
hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Point your Web browser to www.blogger.com,
and click the Layout link for the blog you want
to tweak. Blogger.com lets you have multiple
blogs at the same time. Look for the Layout link
associated with the blog you want to edit.
2.
On the Template tab that opens,
click and drag elements in the
window to move them to a new
position. If your blog elements don’t
look like those in Figure 10-31, don’t
worry. Different templates use dif-
ferent elements, but they’re all
available when using the Add a
Page Element link.

206
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
4.
Click the Edit link in the Blog Posts
section to change the date format,
change the language that credits the
author and labels comments, deter-
mine whether to allow visitors to
e-mail links to friends, and even
rearrange the elements of the blog
post itself.
3.
Click any page element in the page header to
customize the blog title, add a description, or
include an image from your computer or from
a Web site.
5.
If you want to change how posts are
archived, click the Edit link in the Blog
Archive area. You can customize the archive
element by changing its name, determining
the style and frequency of archive organiza-
tion, deciding how to display and order
posts, setting the date format, previewing
changes, or removing the page element.

7.
Click the Add a Page Element link to select
from several Blogger-provided whistles and
bells: polls, lists, pictures, advertising, text,
HTML, RSS feeds, labels, logos, headlines,
and video clips.
6.
The About Me area enables you to tell the
world more about who you are by sharing
your profile or showing your name, descrip-
tion, and location. You can also remove the
entire About Me element from your template.
Again, click Edit to customize these options.
207
Chapter 10: Designing a Blog
8.
Click the Preview button to check
your changes, click Clear Edits to
undo your changes, or click Save to
make the changes take effect on your
blog.
Blogger also enables you to use hexadecimal code in order to use a custom color. Hexadecimal code is a set of
letters and numbers that correspond to red, green, and blue values. Combining these numbers and letters pro-
duces a broad range of colors, although it takes practice to look at a hex code and understand which color it will
produce. Many graphics programs provide hexadecimal codes in their color pickers, so you can use them to find
a color code to use on Blogger. Or, try generating color palettes by using the Color Schemer online Web tool,
available at www.colorschemer.com/online.html.

208
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
10. Repeat Step 9 until your color scheme looks just right, and then click
Save Changes to implement that color scheme on your blog. If you want
to start over with the default template settings, click the Clear Edits
button. For even more fun, click the Shuffle Blog Colors link, which
keeps the same color palette but uses each color in a different way than
the designer intended.
9.
Click the Fonts and Colors link, just
under the Template tab, to open
the Fonts and Colors editing page.
Select from the menu the name of
the element you want to edit, and
choose a color from any of the
three available color palettes:
Colors from Your Blog, Colors That
Match Your Blog, or More Colors.
You can change the colors of many
of the text and link elements on the
page, including the main back-
ground color for the blog. Changes
are displayed immediately in the
Blog Preview pane, below the Fonts
and Colors screen.
11. You can wipe the slate clean by
choosing an entirely new template
to work with: Click the Pick New
Template link, under the Template
tab. The available templates and
their variations are displayed. Use
the scroll bar to find a new tem-
plate you like. You can preview any
design by clicking the Preview
Template link below the correspon-
ding thumbnail. To view different
variations of the same template,
use the radio buttons below each
thumbnail. Click the Save Template
button to make the new template
take effect on your blog. Warning:
Choosing a new template wipes out
any tweaks you made in the Fonts
and Colors section of the Template
tab but retains changes to the Page
Elements section.

209
Chapter 10: Designing a Blog
Integrating a Blogger Blog into Your Web Site
Much of this chapter describes how to use and customize a Blogger blog
for use on the hosted Web service provided by the company. One of the
most useful features of Blogger, however, is that you can integrate the
pages it generates into a Web site you have on another Web server.
If you take this route, visitors to your Web site will see your blog at your
Web address and never need to visit the Blogger servers. If you combine
this feature with complete customization of the blog template, no one ever
needs to know that you use Blogger to run your blog (not that there’s any-
thing wrong with doing so!).
This type of seamless integration takes time and technical expertise, but
after it’s set up, you don’t need to do anything to maintain it, so it’s well
worth the time that’s necessary to do the job right.
There are two prerequisites to integrating your blog with an external 
Web site:
• You must allow anyone to read your blog. In the Permissions area of
the Settings tab, you can configure Blogger so that only invited mem-
bers have access to your blog. By default, anyone has access to your
blog, so unless you change these settings, you don’t need to worry
about this requirement.
• You must use a classic template. (That’s what Blogger calls it.)
I begin with instructions for implementing the classic template:
Toolbox:
 An updated Web
browser, such as
Internet Explorer 7.0 or
Firefox 2.0
 A Web site hosted at
another location
 FTP account information
for your Web host
 A blog on Blogger.com
Time needed:
At least one hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
From the Blogger Dashboard, click the
Settings link for the blog you want to work
with. Because you can have multiple blogs
at Blogger.com, be sure to choose the
Settings link for the correct blog.

210
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
3.
In the Edit HTML section of the
Template tab that opens, scroll to
the bottom of the page and click
the Revert to Classic Template link.
2.
Click the Publishing link on the
Settings tab to open the Publishing
section page. Then click the Classic
Template link in the Hint text.
4.
In the warning dialog box that opens, click OK to
convert your template, or, if you have changed
your mind, click Cancel. When the dialog box
closes, click the Settings tab and then click the
Publishing link to open the Publishing section
page.

6.
Type your server name in the FTP Server field,
and the URL where your blog should be dis-
played in the Blog URL field. In the FTP path
field, type the directory path. The directory
you’re pointing to must already exist on your
Web site. If you don’t know the correct path to
use, contact your Web host.
5.
Click the FTP link. If you prefer to connect to
your Web host by using secure FTP (SFTP),
obtain the proper settings from your Web host
and choose SFTP instead.
211
Chapter 10: Designing a Blog
8.
Type your FTP account username in the FTP
Username field, and your FTP password into
the FTP Password field. Change the settings for
sending pings, if you prefer not do so do auto-
matically. When you’re ready, click the Save
Settings button.
Pings are automatic notifications that your blog
software makes to blog search engines and
other sites when your site is updated. To build
traffic and keep feed subscribers current, leave
this setting on Yes. I talk more about Web feeds
in the “Promoting your blog” sidebar, later in
this chapter.
Blogger saves your information and returns a
confirmation message.
7.
Change the filenames used for the blog home
page and the feed, if you prefer names that are
different from the ones Blogger recommends.

212
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Promoting your blog
Many bloggers subscribe to the idea “If I
publish it, they will come.” Let me be the
first (or not) to burst that bubble: Blogs need
to be promoted as much as any other Web
sites if you’re trying to appeal to an audience
that doesn’t already know and love you. (Is
it considered promotion when you e-mail
everyone in your family to tell them about
your blog?)
The good news is that at a very technical
level, the setup of blogs helps them show
up well in search engine results. And, of
course, search engines love sites with fresh
content, so a frequently updated blog truly
has an edge over one that sees new content
once in a blue moon.
Here’s a quick batch of things you should do
to make the most of your new blog:
Ensure that your blog has an RSS or Atom
feed. A feed is essentially a syndication
mechanism for your blog, a coded presen-
tation of your updates that can be picked up
and read by newsreaders, feed aggregators,
and blog search engines, which in turn pass
whatever they receive from the feed to
humans visiting other Web sites. The result:
eyeballs on your content and links to your
blog. Most blog software can generate auto-
matic feeds, but you should ensure that is
the feature is turned on and functioning. (In
Blogger, you can find the feed configuration
by choosing Settings➪Site Feed.)
Turn on trackbacks and pings. Trackbacks
are a little hard to describe, but I’ll try:
Essentially, a trackback is a way for blog soft-
ware to communicate in the background
and build links to other blogs. It goes like
this: Blogger A posts interesting material on
his blog. Blogger B reads that post, and has
more to say about the same topic on her
blog. Using the trackback URL on Blogger
A’s post, Blogger B’s blog software notifies
Blogger A’s software about the new post.
Blogger A’s software then automatically
builds, in the original post, a link to the new
post. At the end of this (alphabet soup)
process, Blogger A’s readers see the link to
Blogger B’s post and visit her site to read it.
Pings work similarly but are basically a
“heads-up” notification service sent to
some of the bigger blog search engines and
indexers. When you let these Web sites
know that your blog has been updated, your
listings are included in the results that are
displayed the next time someone performs
a search, and again, more readers are
directed to your site.
Many blog software packages offer both
trackbacks and pings, and by simply turning
on these settings, you receive the benefit
with little to no work each time you post to
your blog.
Remember that your blog posts are an
important part of promoting yourself. Keep
the material you write interesting and topi-
cal. For example, if you choose to blog
about a subject that’s in the news headlines,
you can attract readers who might never
have visited your blog otherwise. Keep track
of what’s going on in the world, and think
about how you can relate your topic to 
the broader context of discussion in the 
blogosphere.
From this point on, you can continue to use Blogger to add new entries to your blog. Each time you add a new
post, Blogger publishes it to your Web server.

Successfully message, click the View Blog link

Click the Republish Now link. Blogger attempts
to make contact with your FTP server and
place the HTML files for your blog on the
server. If the process is successful, you receive
a confirmation message. If the process fails,
double-check your FTP information and try
again.

Podcasting Your Own Show
I
f you haven’t been hiding in a cave on Mars, you’ve probably
already heard the term podcasting. It’s one of the hotter Internet
buzzwords of the past five years, and many people have scrambled
like mad to incorporate podcasts onto Web sites.
A podcast is any audio file stored on the Internet that can be down-
loaded and played later on either a computer or a portable device.
That’s the technical explanation.
In real terms, a podcast is a radio show that you can take anywhere on a portable
device, such as an iPod, or play on any computer that’s connected to the Internet.
Podcasts are better than radio programs because you can start, stop, and rewind
whenever you want. You can play them any time, anywhere.
A good podcast can consist of a live interview that’s available to listeners for as long
as a Web site hosts it, a lecture by a Nobel prize-winning professor that students can
use to help them study, or the wail of a newborn infant taking her first breaths. A
podcast can be a long-winded blogger’s rant that will be heard only by a close circle
of fans, or a stirring national address that will be cherished by an entire nation.
Podcasting is limited only by your imagination. As with so many other topics, a
library of books could be filled with the bottomless depths of technical specifica-
tions that can be involved in recording, editing, and posting a podcast. Fortunately,
you don’t need to know all that to get started. In this chapter, you find the most
basic, cost-effective way to produce a professional-quality podcast, using free and
easily available tools and programs.

Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Preparing a Podcast
Be sure to take some time before you record your podcast to plan what you want to
say and how you want to say it. Even trained on-air personalities rarely try to make
live, improvisational recordings. After a few minutes, an interviewer who doesn’t
have at least an outline or some good questions for a guest runs out of things to say,
and the session can turn into a nightmare of “um” and “uh.”
You don’t have to strictly follow a script, however, and stick to every little comma
and pause. One thing that makes listeners respond and come back for more is the
feeling that you’re talking to them rather than at them (like a late-night infomercial).
And, one of the most difficult challenges I can imagine is to make yourself sound nat-
ural and relaxed while giving a monologue.
A good place to start as you plan a podcast is to think about creating a distinct
beginning, middle, and end. A good show usually starts with some kind of introduc-
tion of the host and any guests, moves on to the main topic, and then concludes
with a tease to the next show you plan to produce. This outline for a music podcast
gives you some ideas for what you might include — make your outline as detailed as
you like:
Who’s podcasting?
This list briefly describes some of the
groups of people who are podcasting 
nowadays:
Musicians who want to connect with fans
and promote their bands: Some forward-
thinking bands use podcasts to share
excerpts from live shows, hype concert
tours, and reward fan club members with
exclusive content.
Families who want to remain connected
across distances: Recordings of a baby’s
first words, grandpa’s story time, or a rau-
cous family reunion aren’t proper substi-
tutes for being there, but they can at least
allow people to get a flavor for what they
missed.
Amateur DJs and novice broadcasters who
want to show off their skills: A tight, well-
produced podcast can be an invaluable call-
ing card to a beginner hoping to take the
next step up the career ladder.
Companies that provide training and man-
agement updates, especially to employees
in far-flung offices: A spoken-word explana-
tion of the latest change in corporate strat-
egy that shows up in employees’ e-mail
inboxes can add the kind of “human touch”
that relaxes and reassures employees.
Churches that make their weekly sermons
available: Congregation members who are
ill or traveling or who otherwise can’t phys-
ically attend church can still hear the weekly
services.
Bloggers who want to augment their con-
tent:
Audio clips from interviews are
increasingly popular, as are stream-of-con-
sciousness rants that provoke controversy
and build up page traffic.
Radio producers and other professionals:
Many excellent radio programs that are now
available online as podcasts ensure that you
never miss your favorite show. Listening to
professional podcasts is one of the best
ways to get new ideas for how best to create
your own.

1. Play an introductory music clip.
2. Greet the audience, introduce yourself, and state the number or date of the
podcast.
3. Briefly explain the theme or topic of the podcast.
4. Mention any guests or special announcements.
5. Play new songs.
6. Provide any necessary additional explanation of the theme or topic.
7. Play more new songs.
8. Sum up the theme or topic.
9. Say goodbye, and “tease” the topic of the next podcast.
Although a podcast can theoretically last for hours, in practice, large audio files
become unwieldy very quickly. Listener patience isn’t infinite, either, so unless you
have an absolutely fanatical audience, limit your podcasts to a half-hour or less.
Some of my favorite podcasts are only two to five minutes long, and they’re designed
so that you can listen to as many in a row as you like. If you have a ton of material,
breaking it up into smaller chunks is definitely the way to go.
The many ways to record sound
An increasing number of portable devices
have audio-recording capabilities. Cellphones
and Palm handhelds record audio, laptops
have built-in microphones, and MP3 players
either record or (like the iPod) use after-
market add-ons. Professional radio reporters
have long used minidisc recorders to cap-
ture high-quality audio, whereas some old-
school podcasters just use cables to hook
tape recorder headphone output into their
computers’ microphone input.
Podcasters are increasingly conducting inter-
views or roundtable discussions using
Internet telephone services like Skype or
Vonage. These Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP) services allow users to digitally record
conversations without having to resort to
recording conversations over plain old tele-
phone lines (and entangling themselves in
wires and iffy legal ground).
However, because VoIP conversations are
monaural and most listeners are used to
high-quality stereo, podcasters are using
workaround methods to conduct interviews
over the phone. For example, each party to
a conversation simultaneously records it
into a high-quality stereo microphone. Then,
at the end of the interview, both parties edit
and clean up the audio, e-mail their audio
file to each other, and then stitch together
the files to get both (or more) sides of the
conversation.
Even if you can’t get high-quality recordings
of both ends of a conversation, the host
should record into a microphone even while
the rest of the conversation is recorded over
a phone line or VoIP connection, like Skype.

Recording a Podcast
Recording an audio file can be as simple as speaking into the microphone
on a computer headset or as complicated as setting up a dozen high-end
microphones and a mixing board to get clean sound from every instrument
in a chamber orchestra. Either way, the basic principles I cover in this
chapter are the same.
Many audio professionals believe that the most important link in the chain
is this first one: that using a bad or inappropriate microphone taints the
audio from the get-go. The old computer industry axiom “Garbage in,
garbage out” applies here as well. The good news is that quality micro-
phones are more affordable than ever, and a microphone that costs less
than $100 online or in a basic electronics store fulfills all but the most
demanding needs. The bottom line: You can use your computer’s built-in
microphone, but a good external mic provides better sound quality.
A simple option is to record directly into your computer — most newer
computers come installed with a microphone port. It’s usually red or pink
and located next to the green port where you plug in the headphones. Just
plug in a mic and follow these steps to start recording:
1.
Launch a sound-recording program, such as Audacity, as
shown here. You find a list of some of the more popular
choices in the sidebar at the end of this step list. I chose
Audacity for this chapter because it has enough features
to empower beginners to produce decent-sounding pod-
casts, it works on both Macintosh and Windows comput-
ers, and it’s free. (You can download it at http://
audacity.sourceforge.net/ and use it to follow
along with this task. If your copy of Audacity is a differ-
ent version, you might see minor screen differences or
some functions on different menus.)

As you record, you see the sound
represented as a spectrum across
an audio track. Notice the two
volume meters at the top of the
workspace: The one on the left (the
little speaker icon) shows the play-
back volume; the one on the right
(the microphone icon) shows the
volume of the microphone you’re
using to record. Under the volume
controls, the drop-down menu
enables you to pick from a list of
sources, including microphone,
line-in, aux(iliary), CD player, or
stereo mix. Press the Stop button
to stop recording, or press the
Pause button to pause.
2.
Don’t be overwhelmed by the mass of buttons,
bars, menus, icons, and level meters that com-
prise this program. In the upper-left area of the
workspace, under the menu bar, are some famil-
iar buttons: Skip to Start, Play, Record, Pause,
Stop, and Fast Skip to End. If your microphone is
ready to record, just click the red Record button
(the one with the big red circle) and say some-
thing into the microphone. (Sing a song, recite a
poem, or act like you’re creating your first radio
show!)
Many beginners assume that louder is better when recording. Like a teenager with a new car stereo, they want
to crank the noise to 11 on a scale of 10. But if you record with the volume set to its highest level, you get dis-
tortion, or worse, listeners unsubscribing from your podcast feed.

Audio recording programs
The programs you can use to record and
edit sound files range from free to quite
expensive, depending on the level of control
you want and whether not you want to be
able to compose original music. This list
describes some of the most popular pro-
grams among podcasters and audio editors:
Audacity: This popular audio-editing pro-
gram has more than enough features to pro-
duce a great-sounding podcast, and it’s
available for Mac, Windows, and Linux sys-
tems (which is why it’s featured in this
book). Audacity is free.
GarageBand: Included on new Macintosh
computers (OS X only), GarageBand is used
by many podcasters who are looking for a
quick and automated solution that’s easily
integrated with iTunes. GarageBand is free.
Adobe Soundbooth: A more powerful and
professional editing tool, Soundbooth comes
bundled with other media programs in the
Adobe CS3 suite. Soundbooth is aimed at
people who want to be able to control a few
aspects of their sounds but want menus
with simple, easy-to-understand choices.
The program costs $199 and has a free 30-
day trial period.
Adobe Audition: You can use this tool,
intended for full-fledged audio engineers, to
compose music and adjust and filter voices
using complex and exacting processes. It
costs $399 and has a free 30-day trial period.
Propaganda:
Propaganda 
is 
designed 
to help record and distribute podcasts.
Although it has simplified sound-editing
tools, you can preview your recording on
your iPod or mobile device, and it writes the
RSS code for you. Propaganda costs $49
and has a free 30-day trial period.
SnapKast: SnapKast ($79) bills itself as a
“one-click” podcasting solution that not only
records and edits sounds but also creates
RSS and handles the uploading and syndi-
cation chores.
4.
When you’re done recording, press the Play
button to play back what you recorded. Use the
volume controls to adjust the playback sound.

6.
If you’re ready to share your recording, you can
use the Audacity Export features to save the file
in a format suitable for the Web before you pub-
lish your podcast. Choose File➪Export As MP3
and name your file. To create a new file in
Audacity, choose File➪New, and then you’re
ready to start recording again. Congratulations!
You just took the first step toward having your
own podcast. In the next task, you find instruc-
tions for editing a podcast.
221
Chapter 11: Podcasting Your Own Show
Before you begin recording, make sure that neither the computer nor the microphone is muted.This advice
sounds simple, but even seasoned professionals can tell stories about apparently recording beautiful sounds,
only to find (too late!) that their files contained silence.
5.
To save the recording, choose File➪Save Project
and name it. This step saves your sound file in
an Audacity format and preserves your record-
ing in the best format for editing in Audacity.

222
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Editing a Recording
In this task, you perform basic sound editing to clean up a recording. You
don’t have to use editing tools — in fact, some podcasters wear their
rough-and-scratchy recordings as badges of honor, as proof that they’re
part of an insurgent media that rejects (what they see as) smooth, pol-
ished, and fake corporate style. If this is your ethos, then by all means,
don’t edit your sound files.
Most people, however, prefer to listen to recordings that don’t sound like
they were made in a gravel-sorting machine. And, if you ever venture into
the field to do interviews or record your child’s solo in the school play,
you will probably need to fix the volume or noise level or the big, scratchy
thud of Aunt Edna’s elbow knocking the microphone off the table.
Here are some basic sound-editing tips, to help you reduce noise in your
recordings, cut-and-paste segments, and normalize your recordings. (You
normalize by making the too-soft parts louder and the too-loud parts
softer.)
1.
If your sound-recording program, such as Audacity
(shown here) isn’t open already, launch it and then
create a recording or open an existing one.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
I encourage you to explore beyond these simple steps — most audio programs have tutorials and Help files to
explain what all the arcane jargon means (although if you can explain to me under which circumstances I
would want to use a Hilbert transformer rather than a Dyson compressor and a transient mangler, I’m all ears).

3.
To listen to a portion of the recording, click any-
where on the recording in the audio track area
until you see a vertical dotted line appear
across that portion of the recording. Click the
Play button; the recording should start from the
location of your marker on the track.
2.
To listen to the entire recording, press the Play
button at the top of the workspace. You should
hear your voice (or whatever you just recorded)
playing back. Notice that every time you hear
noise in the recording, you see a corresponding
spike on the graph in the Audio track.
4.
You can rearrange or delete sections of sound
to make a better or shorter recording. Each of
the following steps begins with selecting part of
the sound file. Look in the small toolbox at the
top of the workspace. (The toolbox has six
tools, including Zoom and Time Shift.) Click the
Selection Tool to make it active before the next
step.
5.
To delete a noise, such as a pause or a sneeze,
first click and drag to select that section, and
then press the Delete key. You can easily recog-
nize silence in the audio track because it’s rep-
resented by a flat line in the sound spectrum
graph.

224

7.
To move the sound to another part of the
recording, click to place the cursor where you
want to add the sound in the audio track, and
then choose Edit➪Paste. The word or phrase
that you cut out is pasted into that point in the
recording.
6.
To cut or copy a section of sound, click and
drag to select the section in the audio track,
and then choose Edit➪Cut (or Copy).
8.
To hear the results of your editing, click to
place the cursor where you want to begin 
playback, and then click the Play button. 
Tip: To listen to only a particular section of the
recording, click and drag to select the section
and then click Play. You can then adjust the
selection in the recording until you have just
the part you want to cut, copy, or delete.

11. In the Normalize dialog box, check both boxes for
default normalization. Click Preview to test the sound of
your recording, and click OK to apply the effect.
10. To apply an effect, you must first select the part of the
recording you want to apply it to. Click and drag to
select a portion of the recording, or choose Edit➪
Select➪All to select all of it, and then choose Effects➪
Normalize.
9.
One of the more commonly used options on the Effects
menu is Normalize. When you normalize a recording,
you balance out the highs and lows, to make the overall
volume more consistent.
12. Experiment with the effects, and remember that
you can apply them to any selected part of, or
all of, the recording. Click Play to test your
work, and if you don’t like the results of an
effect, just choose Edit➪Undo to remove it.

226
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Getting rid of “dead air”
Even with only the most basic understand-
ing of audio editing, you can move a song
from the beginning of your podcast to the
end, or move the response to an interview
question to the beginning, to use as a
“teaser.”
Your goal should be to interest listeners
immediately and then keep them interested.
One of the best ways to do that is to delete
all “dead air,” such as pauses and other quiet
spots. This skill is essential for producing a
tight, efficient podcast. Remember that lis-
teners have lives too, and if you ask them to
wait around for a couple of minutes while
you fumble, they will become frustrated.
Some podcasters who are obsessed with
deleting all the dead air between words
review their recordings repeatedly, to shorten
the spaces between words as much as possi-
ble. Although it’s sometimes helpful to
remove the extra breaths and any instances
of “um” and “uh” between sentences, if you
go too far, your recording sounds like you
drank too much coffee and are babbling like
a tobacco auctioneer.
Try to strike a balance. You want your record-
ings to sound natural, like a conversation
you’re having with your listeners (with all the
boring parts cut out). Experience will gradu-
ally teach you the sweet spot.
13. When you’re done, choose File➪Save Project to save the
recording in Audacity format, and then choose File➪
Export and save the recording in a suitable format, such
as MP3, before you publish your podcast to the Web.

227
Publishing a Podcast
How you publish your podcast depends mostly on where you plan to pub-
lish it. Because the process of compressing and optimizing audio files and
then setting them up for podcasting can get complicated, many sites on
the Web are designed to help you simplify the process.
One of the most popular sites for the podcast-publishing process is iTunes.
When you set up an account with a site like iTunes, everything is taken
care of for you — you simply upload your audio file on its online service,
and you’re published.
Similarly, if you have a blog on one of the popular blogging sites, such as
TypePad or Blogger, you find instructions and features designed to help
you add a podcast almost as easily as you add a post.
Find out more about creating and publishing podcasts at these online serv-
ices and other resources:
• Apple iTunes: (www.itunes.com) One of the most popular podcasting
sites on the Web, iTunes makes it easy to download and play podcasts
from a broad range of sources, and the site makes it almost as easy to
publish a podcast. And, you can use iTunes with a PC; you don’t have
to use a Macintosh or an iPod.
• The Podcast Network: (www.thepodcastnetwork.com) This site fea-
tures an international collection of podcasters, useful tutorials, and
helpful tips and tricks about podcasting. It’s an easy way to publish

Mixing in music
You don’t have to be a wannabe DJ to
include music in your podcast. Even if you’re
participating in hard-hitting investigative
reporting or archiving your dad’s favorite
fishing story, music can spice up the record-
ing and make it seem more professional.
You can also add funny sound effects or
snippets of dialogue from TV shows or 
old movies. Just make sure that you have
the legal right to use any music or other 
type of recording. Type free music into 
any search engine and you’ll find tons 
of places where you can download 
sound files. Here are a few to get you
started: MP3.com, GarageBand.com, Indie
heaven.com, Magnatune.com, Freeplay
Music.com, and Sounddogs.com.
You can add a music track to a sound file in
a program like Audacity by using the Import
feature, listed on the Project menu. Adding
a basic audio track isn’t difficult, but mana-
ging all the format options, permissions,
and settings can become complicated, and
is well beyond the scope of this book.
However you’ll find many great books and
online resources if you want to become
more proficient in podcasting. One place 
to start is Expert Podcasting Practices For
Dummies, by Tee Morris and Evo Terra

Multimedia: Adding Flash, 
Audio, and Video
A
s bandwidth has grown on the Web, the use of video files
has grown more dramatically than almost any other multi-
media file type. From YouTube to Revver and Odeo to small, per-
sonal Web sites, millions of video files are being added to the Web
every day.
You, too, can make your Web pages sing and dance by adding mul-
timedia. If you want to provide a richer experience for your users,
to show rather than just to tell, or to entertain as well as inform,
adding animation and video can help you share more information
more vividly and even make you look more professional.
The best news is that adding animation or video isn’t as hard as
you might think. One simple way to add video to a Web page is to upload a video file
to YouTube.com (or search for video already on YouTube) and then insert it into
your page. You find detailed instructions in this chapter.
You can use Dreamweaver to insert multimedia files into your pages and host the
files on your own Web server. Dreamweaver is especially well set up for working with
Flash animation, video, and audio files, and you find step-by-step instructions for
working with Flash in this chapter.
Perhaps the most complicated aspect of multimedia on the Web is choosing the best
format for your audience, which is why you also find in this chapter a primer on
audio and video formats.
Playing Animation and Video on the Web
When you add video or any other kind of multimedia to a Web site, you should know
that your visitors may need a special player (sometimes with an associated plug-in)
to play or view files.

A player is a small program that works alone or with a Web browser to add support
for functions, such as playing sound, video, and animation files. Some of the best-
known multimedia players are Adobe Flash Player, Windows Media Player,
RealNetworks RealPlayer, and Apple QuickTime.
The challenge is that not everyone on the Web uses the same player, and viewers
must have the correct player in order to view your multimedia files. Not all visitors
have the time or interest to download and install a player for a multimedia file. A
multimedia file in a format that’s unsupported by a visitor’s browser isn’t displayed
and might trigger confusing or irritating messages. As a result, many Web develop-
ers help out by offering

Audio and video in two or three formats: A user can choose the format
that best fits the player she already has.

The same multimedia files in different file sizes: Visitors with slower con-
nection speeds don’t have to wait for large files to download.
Comparing popular video formats
One challenge to working with video on the
Web is choosing the best format. This list
briefly describes the most common digital
video formats and their file extensions and
supplies a Web address where you can find
out more about each program.
Flash Video:The newest video format on the
Web, and arguably the one growing fastest
in popularity, Adobe Flash (www.adobe.
com) helps you create Flash videos (using
the .flv extension). Because Flash Player
is so commonly used on the Web, many
developers consider Flash one of the best
programs available.
Windows 
Media 
Video:
Defined 
by
Microsoft and popular on the PC, this video
format (.wmv, .asx) supports some of the
strongest compression features available,
which means that you can get faster down-
load times. See www.microsoft.com/
windows/windowsmedia.
RealVideo: RealNetworks, at www.real.
com, designed the RealVideo file format
(.rm, .rv) to play in RealPlayer. It’s available
for both the Mac and the PC. RealMedia pro-
duces files suited to both low-speed and
high-speed connections but requires special
software on your Web server for streaming.
QuickTime: The QuickTime player, which
reads the .qt and .mov file extensions, is
built into the Macintosh operating system
and used by most Mac programs that have
video or animation. The QuickTime format
works well for video on the Web and 
supports streaming, but it’s used primarily
by people who favor Macs (although
QuickTime files can be viewed on Windows
computers with the QuickTime player). See
www.quicktime.com.
AVI: Created by Microsoft, the Audio Video
Interleave, or AVI, format (.avi) is one of the
most common video formats on Windows
computers, and it can play on most
common video players. AVI works well if
you’re viewing video on a CD or on your
hard drive, where the file doesn’t have to be
downloaded, but you can’t optimize AVI files
well for use on the Internet. If your files are
in AVI format, you should convert them to
one of the other formats before adding
them to your Web site. Otherwise, you force
visitors to download unnecessarily large
video files. You can find more information if
you search for AVI at www.microsoft.com.

231
Chapter 12: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video

Information about all types of players: Visitors can download and install the
best player if they need it in order to view files, if they’re willing and able to.
No matter which player and format you choose, however, I recommend that you

Avoid the more obscure players: Unless you’re offering specialized content
that users have a good reason to download, such as a three-dimensional
game that requires a special program to run.

Remember that many people surf the Web in locations where unexpected
sound can be jarring, disruptive, or worse. Always warn people in offices
and libraries, for example, before you play video or audio, and always pro-
vide a way to turn off the sound quickly when necessary.

Optimize your video so that it downloads quickly and still looks good on
the Web, no matter which player you decide to use. Optimizing multime-
dia for the Web works much like it does with images: the smaller the file
size, the lower the quality but the faster the file downloads. One task in this
chapter shows you how to optimize a video with the free Flash Video
Encoder.
Working with Adobe Flash
Most of the tasks in this chapter focus on techniques using the Flash Player and file
format, but you can also upload most formats to YouTube, which is covered at the
end of this chapter. This chapter focuses on Flash because it has clearly emerged as
the favorite technology for creating animations and a wide variety of interactive fea-
tures on the Web. And, with the new Flash video file, you can create all your video by
using Flash, which is an outstanding choice because Flash Player is so popular.
Flash files can be animations or videos; Flash Player plays both types of files. Flash
animation files use the file extension .swf. Flash video uses the .flv extension. In
addition to the ability to insert Flash animations and Flash videos (created in Adobe
Flash), you can create Flash buttons and text within Dreamweaver.
Before you choose Flash, you should be aware of its few downsides:

Flash might not print as you expect.

Flash can cause accessibility problems for visitors with disabilities.

Text included in Flash files might not be read by search engines (although
including alternative text can help with this limitation).
.

Some people deliberately block Flash files because they’re often used in
advertising. (You may want to describe what they’re missing.)

232
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Despite these downsides, adding a little Flash video or animation can add a lot of life
to your site. And, if you’re not designing your entire site in Flash, it’s quite a safe
format choice on the Web.
Scripts to make Flash function better
When you insert Flash or other multimedia
files with Dreamweaver CS3, the program
automatically creates a JavaScript file 
that helps the file play automatically. The
file, named AC_RunActiveContent.js, 
is stored in the Scripts folder, which
Dreamweaver automatically creates inside
your root site folder. The first time
Dreamweaver creates this file, a dialog box
alerts you that you need to upload the script
in order for your multimedia file to work
properly. Make sure to include this script
(and the entire folder) when you publish
your site on your Web server. If you don’t
include it, your multimedia file may not play
properly, or visitors might be required to
click the Play button twice before the file
begins to play.

233
Chapter 12: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
Inserting a Flash Animation File into a Web Page
Flash animation files are relatively easy to insert into a Web page by using
Dreamweaver. In this section, I assume that you have a completed Flash
animation file and that you want to add it to your Web page. To create a
Flash file, you need Adobe Flash or a similar program that supports the
Flash format. (If you want to know how to create Flash files, check out
Adobe Flash CS3 For Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein and Gurdy Leete, from
Wiley Publishing).
You insert a Flash file in much the same way as you insert an image file, but
because Flash can do so much more than a still image, you choose from a
variety of settings and options for controlling how your Flash file plays.
Before you start, make sure to move or save the Flash file into your root
site folder. If you prefer, you can create a subfolder to store your Flash files.
To add a Flash file to a Web site, first open an existing page or create a new
document and save the file, and then follow these steps:

Dreamweaver displays Flash as a
solid, gray box that represents the
width and height of the Flash file.
Click the gray box to display the
Flash options in the Property
inspector, at the bottom of the
workspace.

7.
When the Play button is pressed, all
features of a Flash file are activated,
just as they would be if the file were
displayed in a Web browser with
the Flash plug-in. As you can see
here, you can start the puzzle game,
which places all puzzle pieces on
the side of the file, and then move
the pieces into place by clicking
and dragging them.
6.
Click the Play button in the
Property inspector to play the
Flash file. In this example, the Flash
file is a puzzle game, so pressing
the Play button displays the game
options. (Note: When the Play
button has been activated, the
button text changes to Stop.)
8.
You can make a number of adjust-
ments to the way a Flash file is dis-
played, by changing the settings in
the Property inspector, such as
Loop, which replays the file if it’s
an animation; Autoplay, which
causes the file to begin to play as
soon as the page is loaded into a
browser; and Quality, which con-
trols how good the file will look,
how fast it will play, and how long
it will take to download.
9.
When you finish adding the Flash file to your page, choose File➪Save to save the
page; Dreamweaver automatically creates the script files and folder for the Flash
file, which become visible in the Files panel. Be sure to upload the entire folder
when you publish your work to the Web.

Converting and Optimizing a Video File
You can convert video from one file format to another relatively easily by
using most video-editing programs. For example, you can open a video in
AVI format in a program such as Adobe Premier Elements (a good video
editor for beginners) and then choose File➪Export to convert the file to
any of a dozen other formatting and compression options.
Editing video gets complicated, and optimizing video for the best quality
with the fastest download time is both an art and a science. The most basic
process of converting a video file isn’t difficult, however, after you under-
stand the conversion options.
This task walks you through the process of converting a video file from
Windows Media into Flash video (.flv) using the Flash Video Encoder. The
encoder is included in Adobe CS3 Creative Suite.
1.
Launch the Flash Video Encoder and click the Add
button to load into the encoder a video that you want to
convert into a Flash video file. In this example, I added a
short video clip that was saved in Windows Media Video
(WMV) format, but you can add video in a variety of for-
mats, including AVI, MP4, and QuickTime.

2.
Click the Settings button on the
right side of the encoder to launch
the Settings dialog box, shown here.
Click the Encoding Profiles tab and
choose a Flash encoding profile.
The later the version of Flash, the
better the encoding looks and the
faster it plays back, but a trade-off is
involved: Not everyone has already
downloaded the latest version, so
using an earlier version may mean
that fewer visitors have to down-
load the player to view your video.
Because Flash is a fast and easy pro-
gram to download, I think that the
latest version is the best choice.
4.
Set the frame rate to the lowest setting that still looks
good, to achieve the fastest download time. If you’re
encoding a video that has lots of action, you need a
higher frame rate — ideally, 24 or better — or else your
video loses details and looks fuzzy in places. If you’re
converting a video, such as this Windows Media file
that has already been encoded, your best option is to
choose Same As Source from the drop-down list to
leave the frame rate unchanged.
3.
Click the Video tab and make sure
that the Encode Video check box is
selected. The video codec (which
controls the compression of the
video) is set automatically based
on the Flash version you selected
on the Encoding Profiles tab. Select
the Deinterlace check box only if
you’re encoding video that’s inter-
laced, such as video captured from
a television or VCR. Video that has
already been encoded in a format
like Windows Media doesn’t need
to be deinterlaced.

238
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
6.
Click the Audio tab and adjust the
data rate. Again, the lower the
number, the lower the quality but
the faster the download. If your
audio file has only a single voice,
you can set this option quite low
and it still sounds good. If your
audio file has music, special sound
effects, or other multifaceted audio
factors, set the data rate to at least
96 Kpbs. Use the Cue Points tab to
insert cues in the file that make it
easier for someone using the file to
jump to a particular section. Use
the Crop and Resize tab to make
the file smaller. (Note that trying to
increase the file size of a video can
result in a severe loss of quality.)
5.
Set the Quality option to the lowest
level that still looks good, to
achieve the fastest download times.
Use the slider under the Preview
window to move through the frames
of the video to see the effects of
your settings.

239

8.
When you get all the settings the
way you want them, choose Start
Queue to begin the encoding
process. This process can take sev-
eral minutes, even for a short file. A
small preview window in the lower-
right corner of the encoder enables
you to watch the encoding process
in action.
7.
When the settings are complete,
click OK; the Settings dialog box
closes, and you return to the
encoder.

Adding Flash Video to Your Site
Flash video is fast becoming the video format of choice among many
designers. Video on the Web has been problematic for a long time because
many different formats are available and you can never guarantee that
everyone in your audience can view your videos in any single format.
Although the video players have been fighting it out for years, Flash has
stepped in to provide an option that’s increasingly well supported
because thousands of people have the Flash player and it’s small and
easy to download.
Because Adobe owns both Flash and Dreamweaver, you find support for
Flash files in Dreamweaver. You can use the Insert dialog box to easily
set the many options for how a Flash video plays within a Web page. In
the previous task, you find instructions for converting a video file into
the Flash format. Follow these steps to insert a Flash video file into a
Web page:
1.
Create a new Web page in Dreamweaver or open
an existing page, and then click to place your
cursor where you want the file to appear on the
page. Then select Common from the Insert bar,
and from the Media drop-down list, choose
Flash Video. (You can also choose Insert➪
Media➪Flash Video.)
2.
At the top of the Insert Flash Video dialog box,
specify streaming or progressive. Note that you
must have a special server for streaming video.
Check with your Internet hosting service or
system administrator to find whether your Web
server supports streaming Flash files. If not,
select Progressive. Click the Browse button and
select the Flash file from your hard drive. If the
file isn’t in your site’s root folder, Dreamweaver
offers to copy it there for you. The Flash file
must be in your site’s local folders because it
must be uploaded to your Web server when you
upload the page that displays the file.

Click the Detect Size button; Dreamweaver
automatically inserts the height and width of
the Flash file into the HTML code. If you want
the Flash video to play as soon as the page is
loaded, click to select the Auto Play check box.
To automatically rewind the video after it has
played, select the Auto Rewind check box.
3.
Dreamweaver calls the collection of controls for
a Flash file a skin. Choose a skin from the drop-
down list. A preview of the selected skin is dis-
played in the dialog box below the Skin selection
(although the drop-down list covers the preview,
as shown here).
6.
Click OK to insert the Flash file and
close the dialog box. The Flash file
is represented in the Web page by a
box that has the same height and
width of the video. Click the box
that represents the video to select
it, and you can make further adjust-
ments to the settings in the
Property inspector at the bottom of
the workspace, such as choosing a
different skin to serve as a player.
5.
The Prompt Users to Download Flash Player If
Necessary option creates a message that’s dis-
played for visitors to your site who don’t have
Flash Player installed. You can edit the message
in the Message box if you want to change the
wording. For example, you can change it to
“Join the modern world — get the latest Flash
Player already!”

242
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
8.
When you insert a Flash video file and include a
skin for the player, Dreamweaver creates a
Flash file with the .swf extension and saves it
in your root site folder. This Flash file contains
the player controls. It must be uploaded to your
Web site when you publish the page with the
Flash file, in order for the player controls to
work on your Web site. In this figure, the file
named Clear-Skin_1.swf contains the Flash
controller.
7.
To view the Flash video, preview the page in a
Web browser by choosing File➪Preview in
Browser and then choosing any browser from
the menu. You must have Flash Player in order
to view the Flash video on your computer. (Note
that the Flash skin, which contains the Play and
Pause controls, and others, becomes visible
only when you roll the cursor over the bottom
of the video.)
If you want to find out more about more advanced Flash settings, or parameters, visit www.Adobe.com and
search for setting Flash parameters.
Finding out more about Flash online
One of the best places to find out more
about creating Flash files is on the Internet,
where a wide range of Web sites offers
everything from predesigned Flash files that
you can easily customize to useful ideas for

Uploading Videos to YouTube
YouTube has attracted a tremendous amount of attention in recent years as
the place to find independently created Web videos. You can not only
upload your own videos to www.youtube.com for all the world to see but
also use the site as a hosting site for videos by simply adding a link to any
video on YouTube to your own Web site.
As you see in this short task, YouTube makes it easy to upload and link to
videos. Just be aware that when you upload your own video to YouTube,
you give up some rights to your content. (Read the agreement at
YouTube.com for more details about copyright and other legal issues.)
Also, you can upload only videos that are smaller than 100MB and take
fewer than ten minutes to play. According to the site: “YouTube accepts
video files from most digital cameras, camcorders, and cellphones in the
.WMV, .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG file formats.” You can also upload files in the
Flash video format.
The good thing is that most videos can easily work within those parame-
ters. If your video is ready to post, follow these steps:

To add the code to your Web page in
Dreamweaver, click the Split View button at
the top of the workspace to view the HTML
code of any page, click to place the cursor in
the code wherever you want the video to be
displayed, and choose File➪Paste to insert
the code you copied from YouTube. (Note:
When you select any text or image in the
design area of Dreamweaver, the correspon-
ding code is automatically highlighted in Code
view, to make it easy to find your place in the
code before you paste the YouTube text.)
3.
When uploading is complete, YouTube dis-
plays a confirmation page that includes
HTML code you can add to your own Web
site or blog to display your video on your
own site. To do so, click and drag to select
all text in the box under the words Embed
this video on your website and then press
Ctrl+C to copy it.
5.
To view your video on the YouTube site, click
the name of the video in your My Videos list.
You can also find your video on YouTube by
searching for the keywords or title you entered
when you uploaded the file. Also, if you inserted
a link to your YouTube video directly in a page
on your Web site, follow the instructions in
Chapter 5 for previewing a Web page to ensure
that your video is displayed correctly.
You can always return to this page to edit your description or keywords and to find the code you need in order to
embed the video in your own site: Click the My Account button and then My Videos, and then select the video
you want from your list of uploaded files.

Q
uestion: “How do you make $1 million on the Internet?”
Answer: “Invest $10 million.”
It’s an old joke, but there’s still truth in it today. Although you can
find many stories about Internet millionaires who became rich with
seemingly little effort or investment, the truth is that most good
Internet businesses aren’t much different from brick-and-mortar
ones. You need a product or service that people are interested in,
you have to deliver it in a way that’s useful and accessible, and you
must be able to promote your business so that customers can 
find you.
Despite the risks involved, many people are making money from
their Web sites, by using one of these two primary models:

Making money from advertising: You can sell and host ads yourself, or you
can sign up for one of the online advertising networks, such as the excep-
tionally popular Google AdSense. In this chapter, you find step-by-step tasks
for creating and integrating advertising using Google AdSense or the affiliate
advertising services Commission Junction or LinkShare, which make it easy
to add advertisers to your site that pay a commission on any sales gener-
ated from your visitors.

Selling products or services online: To sell products or services, you need
to set up a system for accepting payment. Your options range from the
simple (publishing a phone or fax number on your site that customers can
call or send orders to) to the complex (a fancy, integrated shopping cart
that enables visitors to select items as they navigate your site and automati-
cally tabulates their purchase totals). Somewhere between these two
extremes, you can sell products on sites like eBay or Amazon with little
investment (or training) or set up a one-click PayPal button for simple pur-
chases, which you find out about later in this chapter.

PayPal offers one of the simplest ways to sell single products — like memberships,
tickets, or e-books — by using a Web site. If you want a more complicated shopping
system, read my recommendations in the sidebar “Adding a shopping cart to your
site,” at the end of this chapter. I don’t cover these services in detail because
another excellent book in this series, Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, by Joel
Elad (Wiley Publishing), explains this type of sales site in depth.
Because this chapter features live Web sites, some of the screen shots may have
changed since this chapter was written. As a result, you may have to make adjust-
ments to some of the instructions, although the basic concepts and tasks should be
similar.

Adding Advertisers with Google AdSense
You can find Google ads on so many different Web sites that the ads
seem to appear automatically. And in a way, they do. As you see in this
task, you must sign up for an account, select the type of ads you want,
and generate a snippet of code to insert into your own site. After you
set it up, though, the rest is automatic.
Google has developed an extraordinarily complex system that makes it
exceptionally simple to host its ads, and not just any ads, but ads that
Google can specifically deliver to your pages based on a number of cri-
teria. The little snippet of code that you place in your pages enables
Google to handle several tasks at once, including the ones in this list:
• Target ads: The automated Google system reviews the text
on your Web pages and matches any relevant keywords it
finds to related ad campaigns.
• Deliver ads: After the snippet of code is on your pages,
Google can deliver ads automatically based on keyword
targeting and other criteria.
• Track traffic: Google measures the traffic to each page
that displays Google ads and tracks the number of people
who view the page as well as the number of people who
click to view the ad.
• Measure effectiveness: Using a complex system of data
collection and analysis, Google can deliver detailed reports
to advertisers about the success of their campaigns.
• Calculate payments: The system keeps a running total of
the income you’ve earned from your Google ads and
deposits the money into your bank account automatically.
To sign up for Google AdSense, follow these steps:

3.
Fill in the registration form with
your Web site address, your name,
and other details. Be careful to fill
out this form accurately because
the address you enter is the one
Google sends checks to if your ads
are successful.
2.
The Advertising Programs page is
split in two sections: On the left side
is information about buying ads, and
on the right is information about
how publishers can make money by
placing ads on a site (publishers, in
this sense, are site owners who
place ads on a site). In this task, I
focus on the publisher side of the
business, so click the Sign Up Now
button, on the right side.
4.
Pay special attention to the Google Policy sec-
tion, at the bottom of the registration form. You
must select all these check boxes to indicate
that you agree with the policies and will follow
the rules. Google has had problems with site
hosts clicking the ads on their own sites in an
effort to generate income, a practice it now
works hard to prevent because it devalues its
advertising. When you’re ready, click the Submit
Information button.

6.
If you filled out the form correctly, Google dis-
plays a confirmation page, even though you
can’t get started right away. Google reserves
the right to accept or reject anyone who
applies for the AdSense program and, as the
confirmation page warns, it can take a day or
two for Google to review your site and notify
you of your acceptance. In the meantime, you
can find lots of helpful tips and tutorials for
finding out more about how to make the most
of Google AdWords.
5.
On the verification page that’s displayed, read
the form carefully to ensure that your informa-
tion is entered correctly. If you already have an
account with Google (or Gmail or any other
Google service), you can either use that
account with AdSense or create a new login.
Either way, complete the form and click the
Continue button.

Choose the kinds of ads to display
on your pages. For example, select
Ad Unit and then choose from the
options: text ads, image ads, or a
combination of the two, which
results in the largest number of
advertising options for your site.
Alternatively, you can select a link
unit, which displays links to more
general topics (matched to the key-
words on your site) and displays
for visitors a page of ads related to
that topic. After you make your
selection, click the Continue button
at the bottom of the screen.
8.
Click the AdSense Setup tab at the
top of the page and then select the
type of ad you want to create. If you
want to place advertisements on
your Web site, the AdSense for
Content section is the best place to
start. Simply click the AdSense for
Content link to continue.
10. Choose the size and colors of the
ads to display on your pages. Using
the Format drop-down list, choose
a size and shape that works best
with the design of your Web pages.
Note: You can repeat this process
again to create ads of different sizes
for different pages in your site. For
now, choose the one you want to
start with, such as the vertical
120 x 600 skyscraper that I selected
in this example.

12. On this screen, you have the option to create
channels, which can help you track the effec-
tiveness of advertising on different parts of
your site or across different Web sites, if you
manage more than one site. You can create a
channel for a specific domain name or create a
custom channel to track the effectiveness of an
ad size or style that you use across your sites.
Channels are a unique concept at Google, but
they essentially serve as categories for certain
kinds of advertising you want to track.
11. Choose a color scheme from the drop-down list
next to the palettes, or create your own color
scheme by selecting the color check boxes
next to each of the ad elements, such as
Border, Title, and Background. You can also
specify the style — rounded or square — of the
corners of your ads. Finally, choose the content
you want to display if no Google ads match the
content of your Web page. For example, you
can choose to display public service ads for
free if no paying advertisers are available or
simply fill the space with a solid color. Click the
Continue button when you’re done.
251
Chapter 13: Making Money with Your Web Site
13. Finally, you see the Get Ad Code page, where
Google has generated a snippet of code based
on your selections on the previous screens. If
you change your mind, you can always go back
and make adjustments by clicking the Back
button at the bottom of the page. If you’re
ready, simply click and drag to select all code in
the AdSense code window, and then choose
Edit➪Copy to select the code so that you can
add it to your Web pages. Then follow the
instructions in the following task for inserting
code into a Web page.

252
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
To add code to a Web page, open the page in an editing program, such as
Adobe Dreamweaver. In this example, I inserted the code I copied from the
Google AdSense site in the previous task. You can add the same code to as
many individual pages in a site as you want, and you can add the code to a
template page, like the one shown here, to add the code to numerous pages
simultaneously.
1.
The trick here is that you need to paste the
code you copied from the Google site into the
HTML code of your Web page. In Dreamweaver,
the easiest way to do that is to first click the
Split View button, in the upper-left corner of the
workspace, to display the code behind the page
in the top part of the workspace. The advantage
of using Split view is that you can see Design
and Code views at the same time. Here’s a tip:
Click any element in Design view, such as the
headline Dreamweaver Tutorials on the right
side of this page, and Dreamweaver automati-
cally highlights the corresponding code so that
you can find your place more easily.
2.
Find the exact place on your Web page where
you want to add the code, such as these Google
ads, and click to place the cursor in the code.
Then choose Edit➪Paste to insert the code from
the Web site into your page. Notice that the
Google AdSense code is surrounded by
<script> and </script> tags. If you ever
want to change or remove this code, you must
include all of the code.

Chapter 13: Making Money with Your Web Site
When you open Dreamweaver to add your code, leave your Web browser open so that it displays the page
where you copied the code, in case you want to make changes or need to copy the code again.You can easily
switch between two programs on your computer by pressing Alt+Tab (or Ô+Tab on a Mac).
The code you copy from a site like Google may include a script or other code that isn’t in basic HTML.This issue
shouldn’t matter, as long as you copy the code exactly as Google (or any other Web site) instructs you to and
you paste all the code into the HTML in your Web page. For example, if the code begins with a <script> tag,
it should include a </script> tag.
3.
One of the most confusing aspects of adding
Google AdSense code to a page in Dreamweaver
is that, although you can see the code in Code
view, no visible change takes place on the page in
Design view. To view your ads in Dreamweaver,
you preview the page in a Web browser: Either
click the Preview button at the top of the work-
space or choose File➪Preview in Browser and
then select a browser to display the page. As long
as you’re connected to the Internet, the Google
ads should be displayed wherever you added the
code to your page. If everything looks okay,
you’re ready to upload the pages to your Web
server, where the ads will become visible to your
visitors and you can start earning money! (You
find instructions for uploading your pages in
Dreamweaver in Chapter 9.)

Signing Up with Affiliate Programs
Affiliate programs are a special type of advertising program designed to
pay you a commission on any product or service that’s sold if someone
clicks on an ad on your Web site. The tasks of signing up for affiliate pro-
grams and adding their respective code to your Web site work similarly to
the way you do them in Google AdSense, but the way you earn money with
them is quite different.
With AdSense, you earn a small commission every time someone clicks on
an ad on your Web site. If you use affiliate ads, however, you’re paid only if
someone clicks on the ad and then buys something from the advertiser —
but you usually get paid much more if your ad leads to a sale. For example,
a Google ad might earn you a few cents when someone clicks on it, but an
affiliate link to Total Training (which produces video training programs)
can earn you as much as 20 percent of the sale price on purchased videos,
and that amount can be $20 or more per video.
Perhaps the most famous affiliate program is the one created by Amazon.
Like most programs of this type, including Google AdSense (which I cover in
the previous task in this chapter), you must first fill out a registration form
and wait to be approved, and then generate on the Amazon site a snippet of
code that you can add to your own pages. You can find many similar pro-
grams, run directly by companies like Amazon, but if you want to use affili-
ates, you also find sites like LinkShare and Commission Junction, which take
on the task of managing the relationship between advertisers and publishers.
For advertisers, the advantage of a site like LinkShare or Commission
Junction is that it handles all the technical details of signing up publishers,
delivering ads, and tracking results. The advantage for publishers who
want to add affiliate ads to their Web pages is that you can sign up once
with a site like Commission Junction and then add many advertisers to
your pages through their sites.
The following steps walk you through the process of signing up for the
Commission Junction affiliate program (the LinkShare program is quite sim-
ilar, and you can sign up for both programs to access all their advertisers):

When you click the Submit Information button,
Commission Junction displays a confirmation
page and automatically sends you an e-mail
with instructions for completing the registra-
tion process, filling out a W-9 tax-information
form, and logging in to the site with your new

into your Web browser, and use the login and
password information from the e-mail to sign in
to the site.
3.
Review the service agreement, and
note that you must scroll to the
bottom of the agreement and click
the Accept button in order to accept
it. Fill in all required fields, indicated
with an asterisk (*). Commission
Junction asks for a great deal of
information on this page, including
your Social Security number, and

7.
To narrow the list of advertisers
you can browse, click the
Additional Search Options link, at
the top of the Get Links page, to
limit the list by language, product,
and other criteria. Limiting the list
to at least the advertisers in your
primary language is a good start.
In this example, I selected compa-
nies that offer products or serv-
ices for babies.
6.
On the Get Links page, you find a
seemingly overwhelming number of
options, but your first step is essen-
tially to choose the advertisers you
want to work with. A good way to
start is to browse the categories of
advertisers to get a sense of the
available options. Look for advertis-
ers that sell products or services
that are most likely to appeal to the
people who visit your Web site.
8.
As you drill down through the list of potential
advertisers and start to make your selections,
consider the commissions they offer and their
overall performance in the network, all of
which are listed for each advertiser.
If you’re looking for a specific company, you can enter the name into the Search field at the top of the Get Links
page at any time. If the company you’re looking for isn’t available, Commission Junction provides you with a list
of similar companies.

258

10. Most advertisers offer a collection of distinct ad
sizes and designs, and you can choose which
ones you want to place on your pages. When
you find one you like, simply click it to continue.
9.
Click the name of any advertiser to display a
Details page with a description of the company,
program highlights, and links to advertising
options. Click any of the options in the Get
Links box, in the upper-right corner, to generate
the code you need in order to add the adver-
tiser to your Web site. In this example, I chose
the Banner ad option for BabyUniverse.
11. If you’ve never worked with the advertiser, you
need to join its program before you can add its
ads to your site. Some advertisers require a
manual approval process that can take a few
days; others accept you into the program right
away.

13. When you’re ready, simply click the Highlight
Code button to select all code in the code
window. and then choose Edit➪Copy to copy
the code so that you can add it to your Web
pages. Then open the Web page you want to
add this code to in a program such as Adobe
Dreamweaver. You can add the same code to as
many individual pages in your site as you want,
and you can add the code to a template page in
Dreamweaver to add the code to numerous
pages simultaneously. (For instructions, see the
task “Inserting Code into a Web Page in
Dreamweaver,” earlier in this chapter.)
259
Chapter 13: Making Money with Your Web Site
12. After you’re accepted into the program, the
bottom of the Details page changes to offer
options about how you can obtain the code you
need to add to your own site. Choose HTML if
you want to add the advertiser by simply copy-
ing and pasting HTML code into your Web page.
Finding affiliate programs
This list describes a few of the more popu-
lar affiliate programs you can add to your
Web site:
Commission Junction: Featured in the
lesson in this chapter, Commission Junction
(www.commissionjunction.com) is one
of the most popular affiliate networks on
the Web.
LinkShare: Similar to Commission Junction,
LinkShare (www.linkshare.com) is a net-
work of affiliate advertisers and makes it
easy to work with many affiliates at once.
Chitika: Specializing in blogs, this site, at
www.chitika.com, offers publishers a
service that’s part Google AdSense and part
affiliate program, by offering ads that pay
for clicks and sales.
Amazon: One of the oldest and best- known
affiliate programs on the Internet, Amazon
(www.amazon.com) makes it easy to sell
books, computers, and any other products
available on the site with links that direct
your visitors to the exact product page at
Amazon.com.
Check out these popular affiliate programs
online, and don’t forget to search the Web

Adding a PayPal Button
You can sell products and services online in many ways. At the simple
end of the spectrum, you can set up an account at PayPal.com and start
selling products or services in a matter of minutes, with minimal effort
and no upfront investment.
Moving up the scale in complexity and price, you can create a shopping
system at any of the dozens of e-commerce sites that offer more com-
plex shopping cart systems.
I recommend, as a general rule, that you start simple and add more
complex and expensive e-commerce options as you start making more
money. If you’re determined to add a full-featured shopping cart right
away, the book Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, by Joel Elad
(Wiley), gives you detailed instructions for using some of the most 
popular online shopping systems.
If you want to get started with PayPal right away, follow these steps:
1.
Open a Web browser with a con-
nection to the Internet, and enter
the address www.PayPal.com.
Click the Merchant Services tab at
the top of the window to see a
detailed explanation of the many
kinds of payment services offered
by PayPal.
Toolbox:
 A connection to the
Internet
 A Web browser, such 
as Internet Explorer or
Firefox
 A Web site where you
want to add a PayPal
purchase button
 A Web page editing 
program, such as Adobe
Dreamweaver
Time needed:
About half a day

3.
If you already have a PayPal account (even if
you used it only to purchase items in the past),
you can log in with your existing account infor-
mation and continue with the setup process to
upgrade PayPal so that you can use its sales
services. If you’re new to PayPal, click the Sign
Up button to continue.
2.
On the Merchant Services page,
you find links to the many kinds of
payment services offered by
PayPal. Notice that each option
includes a link to sign up, a link to
watch a demo, and a link to find
out more about pricing informa-
tion, including fees and commis-
sions. Click the Sign Up link to
begin the registration process.
4.
You can read about your options and the steps
involved on the Get Started page, but all you
need to do is click the Go button next in the
Sign Up Now area to continue.

262
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
6.
To confirm your e-mail address, click the Go
button. PayPal sends an e-mail message to the
address you entered when you completed the
registration form. Open the link in that message
in a Web browser and enter your password
when prompted to complete the e-mail verifica-
tion process.
5.
Fill in the forms carefully and completely.
PayPal uses this information to process pay-
ments and to verify your identity when you use
its service. When you finish with the online reg-
istration process and enter all your bank infor-
mation, the Get Started page is displayed,
where you can verify your information.
7.
When you complete the registration process,
and whenever you log in to PayPal, you should
see the My Account Overview page, where you
find links to the many features offered by
PayPal. Next, you should complete the bank
verification process, which you can do by
scrolling down the page and clicking the Go
button, next to Confirm Your Bank Instantly.
Because PayPal is a prime target for fraudulent activity and identity theft, it provides many levels of verification
and mechanisms to confirm your information, from your e-mail address to your bank account.Taking a little
extra time to verify all your information can help protect you and your accounts.

8.
To ensure that you’re who you say you are and
that you have access to the bank account you
entered when you registered, PayPal makes two
small deposits into your account. The amounts
may be as little as a few cents, but the goal isn’t
for you to make a lot of money — it’s to make
sure that you can prove that the account is
yours by entering the exact amount of the
deposits into the bank confirmation form on
PayPal. Your bank will likely take a few days to
record the deposits, and you can find out the
amounts so that you can confirm your account.
In the meantime, you can continue to set up
your account and even begin using the PayPal
services. You just can’t withdraw any money
from your bank account until you can tell
PayPal the exact amount that was deposited
into your account.
263
Chapter 13: Making Money with Your Web Site
9.
Click the Merchant Services tab at the top of the screen whenever
you’re logged in to your account, to set up or edit any of your payment
systems for your Web sites. The simplest payment system uses the Buy
Now button. To create one for your site, click the Buy Now Button link
near the upper-left corner of the page.
10. Fill in the Create Buy Now Button form with
information about the product or service you
want to sell and the amount you want to sell it
for. Then select the size and style of button you
want. (This is how the button will appear on
your Web page.) Then choose your shipping
and sales tax options. You also have Button
encryption options: Select the first radio button
to enable encryption if you want to create a
button that’s more secure, but note that it
cannot be edited again after you create it. (Of
course, you can always go back and create a
new button if you want to make changes.) Select
the second button if you want to be able to
modify the code after it’s added to your page.
(You should choose this advanced option only
if you know how to edit the code yourself.)

264
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
11. Click the Create Button Now button at the bottom
of the form to add the Add a Buy Now button to
your Web page. Click the Select All button at the
bottom of the page to select the code that PayPal
generated, and then choose Edit➪Copy to copy
the code. Next, you need to open the Web page
that you want to add this code to in a program
such as Adobe Dreamweaver. (For instructions,
see the task “Inserting Code into a Web Page in
Dreamweaver,” earlier in this chapter.)
Adding a shopping cart to your site
Although PayPal offers a quick and easy way
to start selling products and services on the
Web, you might find many other options
superior, especially if you want to sell many
products or services on your Web site. Here
are a few of the most popular e-commerce
options on the Web:
Yahoo! 
Merchant 
Solutions:
Yahoo!
Merchant Solutions (store.yahoo.com)
offers a full line of e-commerce services,
including a multifaceted shopping cart.
ProStores: ProStores (www.prostores.
com) offers an all-in-one shopping system
and an enterprise-level e-commerce solu-
tion that includes supply-chain and vendor-
management tools.
1&1:The 1&1 site (www.1and1.com) claims
to be the largest domain registrar in the
world. This site also provides Web hosting,
e-commerce, and a shopping cart system.
PayLoadz:
PayLoadz 
(www.payloadz.
com), which works with PayPal, is specially
designed to sell downloadable products
such as e-books and software, and fee-
based services, such as subscriptions and
memberships.
For more detailed instructions on working
with these shopping carts, read the book
Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, by
Joel Elad (Wiley Publishing).

Ten Cool Services for Your Site
In This Chapter
 Finding inexpensive professional images
 Using pop-up previews
 Identifying fonts in graphics
 Creating surveys for your visitors
 Adding a favicon to the address bar
 Hiding your e-mail address from spammers
 Tracking Web visitors
 Setting up a teleconference
T
he best Web sites include a broad range of features, from attractive graphics
to interactive surveys to detailed reports about site visitors. But many of the
most advanced features are highly complex to create and maintain. Fortunately, a
growing list of Web services allows you to easily add specialized options to your
Web site, without having to spend a lot of time or money. In this chapter, I introduce
you to some of my favorite online resources — sites that can help you take your
site beyond the basics without breaking the bank.
Most Web-based services like these make it easy to set up an account and then gener-
ate a snippet of HTML code that you can add to your own Web site. You find instruc-
tions for adding code snippets to your pages using Dreamweaver in Chapter 13.
Finding Out Who’s Visiting Your Site
Most Web hosting services provide basic log reports and traffic information, but 
if you truly want to know how people are finding your Web site and what they’re
doing after they get there, consider using a service such as StatCounter.com
(www.StatCounter.com) or Webstat, described in detail in the next section. 

268
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Tracking visitors with Stat Counter
To use the StatCounter service, you set up an account and fill out a few forms to
create a custom setup for your site. Then just copy a bit of code from the site into the
code in your Web pages. StatCounter then uses that invisible bit of code to track site
traffic and generate reports that you can view to learn more about your site’s visitors.
(You find instructions for adding a snippet of code to your pages in Chapter 13.)
You can start with a free, limited level of service at StatCounter and then upgrade for a
fee to view more data (up to 15 million page loads per month). Visit StatCounter.com
for a demo and a sample report showing all the different kinds of information you
can collect, including which keywords people use to find your site through search
engines, which browsers they use to visit your pages, and how long they stay after
they get there. Studying how people use your Web site is one of the best ways to
determine how to develop your content and design and establish where you’re likely
to achieve the greatest success with your Web site.
Watching traffic with Webstat
If you’re looking for the best services for your site, give the online traffic-reporting
system Webstat (www.webstat.com) a try. Similar to StatCounter, Webstat has you
set up an account and then insert a snippet of code from its system into your pages.
At Webstat, you can display a Web counter on your pages for visitors to see, or you
can keep your traffic numbers private by using its invisible service. Sign up for a 
limited free account, or consider one of the paid levels of service for more detailed
reports.
Downloading Professional 
Images Inexpensively
Professional photographs and graphics can transform a simple page design into a
professional showcase. But high-quality images can be pricey. For professional, 
royalty-free images without the high price tag, visit iStockPhoto (www.istock
photo.com) where you can buy — and sell — high-quality photos and other images
for $1 to $5 (depending on the resolution).
This searchable site makes it easy to find all kinds of photographs, illustrations, and
even animated graphics and videos. Search for German Shepherd, for example, and
you’ll find nearly 1,000 photos of those lovely beasts; search for dogs and you’ll find
more than 16,000. You can even search for general terms, like smile or raised hands,
to find images to fit almost any design idea or Web site.
When you find a photo that you like at iStockphoto, you have the option of down-
loading a “comp” version for free. (It has the iStockphoto logo printed across the
middle but is handy for mockups). You can also save images into a collection (called
a lightbox) that’s stored on the iStockphoto Web site so that you can easily go back
and review your favorites later. 

269
Chapter 14: Ten Cool Services for Your Site
When you’re ready to purchase images, you can use any major credit card to buy cred-
its on the site. The more credits you buy in advance, the better the price. The cost of
each image is based on the resolution — the higher the resolution, the more the image
costs, and most images are available in multiple resolutions. Low-resolution images,
which work fine for most Web sites, cost as little as $1. The standard rights agreement
covers most commercial uses up to 500,000 copies. An extended license is available
for a higher price. Make sure to read the license agreement for details. 
In Chapter 4 you find instructions for editing, resizing, and saving images. See
Chapter 5 for instructions for inserting images into your Web pages.
Highlighting Links with Pop-Up Previews
The innovative online service Snap.com (www.snap.com) creates a small pop-up
preview of any page you link to on your site. You simply sign up — for free — at
Snap.com and use its online tool to generate special code that you can copy and
paste into the code in your Web pages.
With the unique Snap.com pop-ups, anytime a visitor rolls the cursor over a link, a
small pop-up window appears with a preview that displays the page or site that you
linked to from your site. It’s a useful way to give visitors a little more information as
they peruse your pages and to highlight the links on your site.
What the Font? (An Online Matchmaker)
If you’ve ever tried to identify an unusual font, you know how challenging it can 
be and you’ll likely appreciate the character-recognition software offered at
WhatTheFont.com, (www.whatthefont). Using this free, online service, you can
upload any graphic or enter the URL to any image on the Web, and the program
analyzes the image and tries to identify the font.
The system isn’t perfect, but even if WhatTheFont can’t identify the exact font, it
gives you the closest matches it can find, which at least gets you pointed in the right
direction. You can also opt for the “human” service, to have your graphic further
reviewed by expert font matchers.
And, if you want to buy the font after you use the service to identify it, the site’s 
creators are happy to sell you fonts that you download to your own computer. For
more on the best options for using fonts on the Web, see Chapter 5.
Surveying Your Visitors
If you want to know what visitors to your site really think, just ask them.
An online survey is a helpful way to gauge the experience of your audience and to
invite reviews. You can also use online surveys as planning tools to poll your audi-
ence about how and where they might want an event, for example, or which new 
features they’re most interested in.

270
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can create a free, online survey at SurveyMonkey.com (www.surveymonkey.
com), and link to it from your Web site. Survey Monkey makes it easy to create the
survey by simply filling out a form in a Web browser and then automatically tallies
the results and presents them in a series of reports and pie charts. It’s an excellent
way to impress your board of directors at your company’s next annual meeting.
Dressing Up the Address Bar with a Favicon
Have you ever wondered how some sites add those little custom graphics to the
address bar, at the top of the browser? For example, Google adds the letter G and
Adobe adds its logo. You too can add any image to your site — you just have to get it
in the right format.
Fortunately, turning a graphic into a favicon (or shortcut icon) is easy and free at
www.htmlkit.com/services/favicon/. Just upload any graphic of your own,
and this online tool automatically converts it into a favicon that you can use on your
site. After your image is saved in the .ico format, you simply upload it to the main
root folder of your Web site, and your image is automatically displayed on the
address bar in a browser.
Favicons also appear in the list of bookmarks, or favorites (which is where the name
comes from) when a visitor saves your Web site in a browser. Including a favicon,
therefore, can make your site stand out from a list of saved Web addresses and can
help build and strengthen your brand.
Protecting Your E-Mail Address 
from Spammers
Spammers gather millions of e-mail addresses from Web sites every day by collecting
e-mail addresses from links on Web pages. Web designers commonly include e-mail
links so that visitors can easily contact them. Unfortunately, those simple e-mail links
make it even easier for spammers to gather e-mail addresses automatically.
To help counter this problem, the programmers at AddressMunger.com
(www.addressmunger.com) have come up with a special way of “hiding” e-mail
addresses from the automated bots that spammers use. When you add this special
code to your Web pages and use AddressMunger to create the e-mail links on your
Web pages, your visitors can still e-mail you easily, but spammers can’t read your
e-mail address. It’s an easy way to cut down on all that spam in your inbox.
To use this service, you add two snippets of code: one into the top of a Web page
and another wherever you want your e-mail address to appear. You find instructions
for adding code to your pages in Chapter 13.

271
Chapter 14: Ten Cool Services for Your Site
Setting Up Free Conference Calls
Conference-calling services capable of hosting dozens or even thousands of callers
used to be costly and complicated systems. Now, thanks to the online services at
FreeConference.com (www.freeconference.com), you can set up conference calls
for free. For a specialized service, such as a conference call with an 800 number or a
recording of the call after it’s completed, you have to pay a fee, but it’s much lower
than traditional conference-calling systems.
To use the service, simply sign up for the free account, and you can immediately
start scheduling conference calls.
Many people now provide online training and teleconferences by setting up confer-
ence calls with a service like FreeConference and then providing an online compo-
nent, such as a PowerPoint presentation on a Web site like SlideShare.net (described
in the following section).
Sharing PowerPoint Presentations
Online training, teleconferences, and virtual seminars are increasingly popular,
thanks to services like SlideShare.net (www.slideshare.net). To use this innova-
tive service, just upload your presentation to the site and point visitors to your spe-
cial address, where they can view your slides and use the simple controls at
SlideShare to move forward and back through your presentation.
Combine SlideShare with a service like FreeConference and you’re ready to host a
professional teleconference or online seminar — without spending a cent.

W
hat if you build a Web site and nobody comes? Unfortunately, that’s an all-
too-common problem on the Internet. And, that’s why I can’t end this book
without at least pointing you in the right direction to promoting your Web site.
Driving significant traffic to the pages of a site requires a significant amount of time
or money or an incredibly compelling message. If you can manage all three, you
should do very well indeed.
In this chapter, you find tips and online resources and my best advice for getting
people to visit your Web site.
Making Your Site Search Engine-Friendly
The buzzword here is search engine optimization, or SEO, a highly complicated sci-
ence that involves getting search engines like Google and Yahoo! to list your Web site
higher on the page than your competitors.
Thousands of companies and services promise to “get you in the top 10 matches” on
search engines for as little as $39.99. Be wary of these services. The truly good ones
charge thousands of dollars per month (with good reason), and the bad ones can get
you kicked off search engines for breaking the rules.
Scoring high in Web searches is complicated because millions of sites are vying for
the top spots and because search engines use complex formulas for determining
which Web site should match any given keyword search. Search engines also guard
their formulas more carefully than Coca Cola guards its syrup recipe. Search engines
also change their formulas regularly. (How regularly is also a secret.)

274
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The reason for all this secrecy is that the people who run sites like Google.com want
to deliver the best results when someone searches the site, not just a list of the sites
that smart Web marketers figured out how to position at the top. But there’s much
money to be made at the top, so Web marketers spend countless hours testing how
search engines work to come up with their best guesses about the criteria that
search engines are using and how best to move their sites up the list.
The result is sort of a cat-and-mouse game, with search engines changing the rules
to thwart the marketers’ most-calculated efforts, and people who specialize in
search engine optimization charging big bucks to figure out the secret formula that
can put you on top.
The more competitive the keyword you want to match, the more challenging the
game. For example, if you want to be the first hotel listed when someone searches
for Hawaii + hotel, you’re in for a challenge. If you own a bed-and-breakfast (B&B) in
a rural area, however, it may not be hard to score high when someone searches for
locations in your small town.
Although the subtleties of the search engine game are complex, the basic criteria
that search engines use are straightforward. For the most part, search engines score
sites based on the words and images on Web pages and on how well their content
matches the keywords that are searched. For example, if you own a B&B in Point
Reyes Station, California, you should include at least the name Point Reyes Station
on your Web site because people searching for lodging in the area are likely to
include the town’s name in their search.
A great way to determine how best to make your own site search engine friendly is
to search for keywords that you want to use to lead people to your site and then
study the Web sites that match. Look closely at not only the words on the page but
also which words are in headlines and in bold, and at how the page title at the top of
the browser is worded. Often the best way to move yourself up the ranks in search
results is to emulate the strategies of other sites that are already doing well.
Achieving the best placement, especially for popular keywords, is a full-time job, but
here are a few tips that most SEO specialists agree are likely to help you score better
in search engine searches.

Fill your site with fresh, original content related to your business or
industry. If you read the Tips section on most search engine sites, you find
that the best way to score high is to create a Web site that’s relevant to the
keywords you want to match. The best way to do that is to include stories,
tips, FAQs, and other content that’s valuable to your visitors and related to
your business or service, and to keep it updated by adding fresh content
regularly.
To continue with the B&B example, you can develop an Activities section
like the one the Black Heron Inn uses. Then write a story about the extraor-
dinary wildlife in your area, create a Top Ten list of the best reasons to visit
the ocean in the spring, or design a guide to nearby hiking and biking trails
with tips on how to plan the ultimate outing. Adding these kinds of features
to your Web site not only serves your visitors when they get to your site but
also can make a huge difference in the likelihood that search engines will
deem your site worthy of sending those visitors to you in the first place.

275
Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site

Invite other sites to link to you. Google rewards people who attract the
most links to their sites, especially if those sites already have good rank-
ings. It makes sense: If lots of other Web sites consider your site good
enough to send their visitors to you, you probably have something of value
to offer. Thus, one of the best ways to improve your ranking in search
engines is to have a good collection of links from other Web sites. You can
get other sites to link to you by offering to link to them and asking them to
return the favor; by offering stories, tips, or other content so compelling
that they want to send visitors to you; or by paying the other sites to add
links to you. (I tell you more about that strategy in the “Buying Traffic” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.)

Develop a list of keywords and a good description for your site. The trick
to writing a good Web site description is making it concise (every word
counts), packing it with your most important keywords, and phrasing it so
that it reads like a sentence (not just a list of words). Include this descrip-
tion toward the top of your home page and in the Meta description tag,
which is a special tag that can be used to add information for search
engines that doesn’t appear in the body of a Web page. Similarly, you can
include a list of keywords in the Meta keywords tag. (You can find instruc-
tions for adding content to these two Meta tags in the section “Adding Meta
Tags for Search Engines,” in Chapter 5.)

Include your most important keywords in the title of your Web page. The
title doesn’t appear in the body of a Web page; the text appears at the top of
the browser window. You can add or edit the title of a page in Dreamweaver
by changing the text in the Title field at the top of the screen.

Include keywords in the headlines on your Web page. Most search
engines place higher priority on keywords that appear in the headlines on a
page than in the body of the page, but only if you use HTML heading tags to
style those headlines. Heading tags, which include H1 (the biggest) through
H6 (the smallest), identify text as headlines in a way that search engines
easily recognize. All templates that you can download from this book’s com-
panion Web site use heading tags to format headlines. (See the introduction
for more details about the Web site.)

Don’t expect instant (or permanent) results. Even if you do everything
right in the search engine search game, you might still have to wait for your
Web site or new content to be included in searches. Some search engines
update their databases almost instantly; others can take weeks or months
to reflect changes to Web pages on the Internet. This situation is a common
challenge with Google, which seems to update the most popular sites
almost instantaneously while lagging weeks or months behind in updating
less-visited sites.
Even if you get that great search result you’re hoping for, don’t count on staying at
the top of the list. Search engine rules change frequently, and new competitors can
emerge at any time, pushing your Web site lower down the list if you’re not actively
working on keeping it at the top.
Because search engine optimization is so complex and success can be fleeting, many
people prefer to use the somewhat more certain approach — search engine advertis-
ing, described in the following section.

276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
A great place to learn more about how search engines work and how to achieve the
best ranking is www.searchenginewatch.com.
Buying Traffic (Yes, You Really Can!)
In addition to the “natural” results that search engines deliver when someone does a
keyword search, search engine advertising appears at the top and right sides of
most search-result pages. Buying keywords on search engines help to ensure that
your site is listed when someone searches for words that are relevant to your site,
although the process is far more complex than most people realize. 
Not all keywords sell for the same price. Using a complex bidding process, most
search engines charge significantly more for the most popular keywords. Adding to
the complexity, the results of those keywords for your site can vary dramatically
based on a dizzying array of factors. For example, the expensive keyword Hawaii
may bring the most amount of traffic to your site, but the lower-priced keyword luau
may result in more reservations to your hotel. Because it’s possible to measure not
only the traffic from a keyword search but also the actions of the person who clicks
on that keyword, you can quickly measure and compare the effectiveness of search
engine advertising.
Again, this process can be highly complex. Just developing a list of keywords worth
purchasing seems easier than it really is at first. Sure, if you have a B&B in Point
Reyes, you can likely make a list of the obvious words quickly. But the real art of
developing a list of keywords for search engine advertising requires more than just
brainstorming 20 or 30 words related to your business. The best SEO companies
come up with hundreds or thousands of keywords and then track the results to get
the most new customers per click and dollar spent.
This strategy pays off because search engines charge for a keyword ad only when
someone clicks on the ad. Thus, running a campaign with 10,000 words might not
cost much more than running a campaign with 100 words, and might prove much
more effective over time.
Add to that strategy the importance of landing pages and sales messages. The most
sophisticated ad campaigns involve creating special Web pages to go with each key-
word. For example, you can create a very different Web page on your Hawaiian hotel
site for people who click on the search term scuba diving than for those who click
on the search term health spa. If you have an adequate budget, you might do well to
hire professional search engine advertising services to manage and develop a cam-
paign like this one for you.
Google AdSense is the largest online advertising program for keywords. Just click on
the Advertise button at www.google.com to find detailed instructions and a
number of tips and tools to help you find the best keywords for your site.

Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
Promoting Your Site with 
Social Networking Sites
Social networking, the art of meeting and building contacts on the Web, is an increas-
ingly popular way to increase your personal and professional contacts, make new
friends, develop professional relationships, and even find a new job. You can also
use social networking sites to promote your personal or business Web site.
Netiquette (Internet etiquette) calls for a subtle approach to promoting your site in
these kinds of environments, but simply including your Web address in your online
profile can help drive new people to your site. 
Here are some of the most popular social networking sites and what you can expect
to find there:

MySpace (www.MySpace.com): One of the all-time most popular social net-
working sites, MySpace makes it easy to create a profile site, add music,
write a blog, and post as many photos as you want to share with the world.
Although the site has dominated the social networking landscape on the
Internet, at the time of this writing, it was rapidly losing members. Still, its
huge online audience is a popular place for musicians, performers, and
many others to promote themselves and their Web sites.

LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com): Increasingly, this is the site for profession-
als and online networking. If you’re online to network with other profession-
als, especially if you’re job hunting or trying to attract new business clients,
this is a powerful place to promote yourself and your Web site.

eCademy (www.eCademy.com): Similar to LinkedIn, eCademy is a site
where professionals network, seek new clients, hunt for jobs, and recruit
employees. What makes eCademy different is that it’s much more interna-
tional, with an especially strong audience in Europe.

Facebook (www.FaceBook.com): Originally designed for students, faculty,
and university staff, Facebook is no longer restricted to those with a .edu
e-mail address, and it’s growing fast now that anyone who wants to partici-
pate can join the site’s community. The site was originally considered a
vanity site and a place for students to connect and trade stories, but its pro-
fessional power is growing with its ever-expanding audience.

Friendster (www.Friendster.com): One of the first online networking
sites, Friendster was especially popular with the dot-com crowd in San
Francisco and continues to have a relatively small, but very loyal, following.

Ryze (www.Ryze.com): This site hosts many real-world networking events
and is especially popular in a few urban areas, including Los Angeles and
San Francisco.

Ning (www.Ning.com): You create your own social networking site at Ning
and invite your friends and colleagues to create profiles there.

278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Getting Your Site Ranked on 
Social Bookmarking Sites
Social bookmarking sites rank the popularity of Web pages by the number of votes
they get. The result is that these sites are excellent resources for people who want to
keep up with what’s popular online. Most offer special software that makes it easy to
vote on a site, and they feature catchy and unusual names, like Digg and del.icio.us,
that encourage users to rank sites they visit frequently.
Getting your site listed on social bookmarking sites is a highly effective way to
increase traffic. Dozens of these sites and services exist, with more sure to come;
among the most popular are Digg.com, Stumbleupon.com, and readdit.com.
Although it’s designed to store and share bookmarks, del.icio.us (that’s really the
address — you type it just like that) is another site where users can search for con-
tent that other people have tagged as being useful and relevant.
Although you can submit your own pages on any of these sites, it’s generally
frowned on, and if you do it too frequently, you can be banned from these sites.
Besides, your one little vote won’t make much difference anyway. A better method is
to add a button to your site from each of these services that makes it easy for your
visitors to vote for you. If you’re a blogger, you can add a button each time you post.
You can get the buttons (also called chicklets) for free and add them to your pages
by simply inserting a little code you generate on the social networking site. (You find
instructions for adding code to your pages in Chapter 13.)
Enticing Visitors to Return 
for Regular Updates
One of the best ways to improve traffic to your site is through repeat visitors, and
regular updates to your site can make all the difference. If you want your visitors to
know when to look for updates, consider making regular changes to your Web site.
Add a post to your blog every Thursday morning, for example, or post your newest
photos to the site on Saturday morning. Regular updates help get people in the habit
of visiting your site.
Gathering Ideas from Other Web Sites
One of the best ways to create good habits in Web design is to visit other people’s
Web sites and study what works and what doesn’t on their pages. While you’re
there, check out the title of the page, any descriptive text, or keywords that are used
throughout the site.
As you look at related Web sites, ask yourself what you like about the site and why
you like it. Also, determine whether you can easily find the information you’re most
interested in and how easily you can navigate around the site.

279
Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
Sometimes the best way to discover the problems in your own Web site is to look for
problems on someone else’s site and then return to yours with a fresh perspective.
Similarly, you can gain many great ideas, from design tips to marketing ideas, by
studying what people do on other Web sites.
Marketing a Web Site to the Media
Attracting traditional media attention to your Web site is not unlike attracting it to
any other business. The trick is to tell a good story and get the attention of someone
who can write about it in a publication that’s read by your target audience.
If you’re looking for press coverage, make sure to include a Press section on your
Web site with contact information, story ideas, and any other press coverage you
already received.
Don’t wait for journalists to come to you! You should never pester a reporter with a
barrage of e-mail, press releases, or phone calls, but a well-timed or well-pitched
message can get the attention of a reporter and the desired result — your Web
address in the press. One good way to find journalists who might be interested in
your site is to visit related sites and study their Press sections to find out who has
been writing about them. Note not only the publication but also the writer, and send
a note directly to that person with a message that starts like this:
Dear fabulous journalist <insert that person’s name, of course>:
I enjoyed reading the article you wrote on the XYZ company and thought that
you might be interested in what we’re doing.
Keep your message brief, and try to include a news hook and story idea that go
beyond just promoting your business. For example, rather than tell a reporter that
you have the best B&B site in northern California, pitch a story idea. For example,
send a note to a travel writer offering to help with a story on the best hikes in the
area. With any luck, the story on great hikes will include a quote from you and a
mention of your B&B’s Web site (especially if the reporter can send readers to your
list of hiking tips).
Unleashing the Power of Viral Marketing
Viral marketing is another of the marketing industry’s new buzzwords in the digital
age. The idea is that a message (a video, an article, or a photo, for example) is so
exciting, fun, and compelling that people want to share it with each other and pass it
on to their friends, who then pass it on to their friends, until it spreads like a virus.
Such messages are often spread via e-mail, blogs, or chat, which can make the ever-
expanding impact happen at an almost instantaneous pace.
Tap into the power of viral marketing, and you can become an overnight sensation.
Humor seems to be the most effective strategy. Among the mainstays of the viral
phenomena are those silly photos of cats with clever sayings, known as the LOL

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
cats, which have spawned several Web sites, like ICanHasCheeseburger.com. Funny
video clips, the kind you would expect to see featured on a show like America’s
Funniest Home Videos, are also highly viral because they’re shared around the Web.
So how do you use viral marketing to attract traffic to your Web site? Include a 
section with funny photos, industry jokes, or a Top 10 list, and you might just get
visitors to tell their friends about your site.
Blogging, Blogging, Blogging
Adding a blog to your Web site is not only an easy way to add fresh content to your
Web site, but when you become a blogger, you also join the ranks of a prolific group
of writers who regularly refer their readers to each other’s Web sites.
Don’t launch a blog just to “do it.” Make sure that your blog features interesting, rele-
vant information for your audience and that you update it regularly. And, if you want
your blog to serve as an effective marketing tool, take the time to participate in
other people’s blogs. Adding relevant tips and thoughtful comments to other
people’s blogs is an excellent way to get their visitors to come back to your Web site.
Instructions for creating a blog and integrating it into your Web site are in Chapter 10.
Telling Everyone You Know
It might seem obvious, but many people are either too shy or too busy to reach out
to their friends, family, and personal contacts when they launch a Web site. Don’t
overlook your most obvious supporters.
Launching a new Web site, or redesigning an existing site, is an excellent excuse to
e-mail personal and professional contacts. To make the announcement even more
fun, consider sending an e-card with a colorful character, animation, or music to
dramatize your announcement.
Hallmark.com is one of my favorite e-card sites because it has lots of free cards with
clever sayings, professional designs, and interactive animations. Most of its free 
e-cards even include sound. BlueMountain.com is another useful e-card site, but you
have to pay for the pleasure of sending its professional greetings.
When choosing an e-card to announce your Web site, look for blank cards or the
Friendship and Any Occasion sections, where you can find messages that are easily
personalized for nearly any kind of Web site.
Make sure to include your URL on all your marketing and other materials, too. Your
Web address should be prominently displayed on your business cards, brochures,
stationery, and anywhere else you promote your business.
