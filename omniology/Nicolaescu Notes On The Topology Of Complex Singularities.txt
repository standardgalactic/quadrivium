In

The
algebraic
v
arieties
ha
v
e
pla
y
ed
a
v
ery
imp
ortan
t
role
in
the
dev
elopmen
t
of
geometry
.
The
lines
and
the
conics
where
the
rst
to
b
e
in
v
estigated
and
moreo
v
er,
the
study
of
equations
leads
naturally
to
algebraic
geometry
.
The
past
cen
tury
has
witnessed
the
in
tro
duction
of
new
ideas
and
tec
hniques,
notably
algebraic
top
ology
and
complex
geometry
.
These
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
dev
elopmen
t
of
this
sub
ject.
There
are
sev
eral
reasons
whic
h
mak
e
algebraic
v
arieties
so
attractiv
e.
On
one
hand,
it
is
their
abundance
and
the
w
ealth
of
tec
hniques
a
v
ailable
to
study
them
and,
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
the
often
unexp
ected
conclusions.
These
conclusions
lead
frequen
tly
to
new
researc
h
questions
in
other
directions.
The
gauge
theoretic
rev
olution
of
the
past
t
w
o
decades
has
only
increased
the
role
pla
y
ed
b
y
these
ob
jects.
More
recen
tly
,
Simon
Donaldson
has
dra
wn
atten
tion
to
Lefsc
hetz'
old
tec
hniques
of
studying
algebraic
manifolds
b
y
extending
them
to
the
m
uc
h
more
general
con
text
of
symplectic
manifolds.
I
ha
v
e
to
admit
that
I
w
as
not
familiar
with
Lefsc
hetz'
ideas
and
this
ga
v
e
me
the
imp
etus
to
teac
h
a
course
on
this
sub
ject
and
write
up
semi-
formal
notes.
The
second
r
aison
d'
^
etr
e
of
these
notes
is
m
y
p
ersonal
in
terest
in
the
isolated
singularities
of
complex
surfaces.
Lo
osely
sp
eaking,
Lefsc
hetz
created
a
holomorphic
v
ersion
of
Morse
theory
when
the
traditional
one
w
as
not
ev
en
b
orn.
He
sho
w
ed
that
a
holomorphic
map
f
from
a
complex
manifold
M
to
the
complex
pro
jectiv
e
line
P

whic
h

critical
p
oin
ts
con
tains

of

ab

.
This
infor-
mation
can
b

b

the
b
eha
vior
of
the
smo
oth
b
ers
of
f
as

Naturally
,
one
can
in
v
estigate
what
happ
ens
when
f
has
degenerate
p
oin
ts
as
w
ell
and,
unlik
e
the
real
case,
there
are
man
y
more
to
ols
at
our
disp
osal
when
approac
hing
this
issue
in
the
holomorphic
con
text.
This
leads
to
the
lo
cal
study
of
isolated
singularities.
These
notes
co
v
er
the
material
I
presen
ted
during
the
graduate
course
I
taugh
t
at
the
Univ
ersit
y
of

in
the
spring
of
2000.
This
course
emphasized
t
w
o
sub
jects,
Lef-
sc
hetz
theory
and
isolated
singularities,
relying
mostly
on
basic
algebraic

On
the
other
hand,
after
reading
parts
of
[23

I
w
as
left
with
the
distinct
feeling
that
Lefsc

study
of
algebraic

lead
to
new
results

The

Ho

here

go
o
d

The
heigh
t
of
the
Newton
p
olygon
of
f
1
is
substan
tially
smaller.
It
is
equal
to
one,
and
it
is
due
to
the
presence
of
the
non
trivial
monomial
(6c
5
0

6c

0
)y
whic
h
sho
ws
that
the
m
ulti-exp
onen
t
(0;

lies
in
the
supp
ort
of
f

.
Let
us
phrase
this
in
dieren

terms.
The

that

S
(f

is
equiv
alen
t
to
@
f

@
y
(0;

6=

Using
the

implicit

theorem
w
e
deduce
that
w
e
can
express
y
as
a
holomorphic
function
of
x,
y

y

Note
that

If

it
is
natural
to
consider
their

b

By
c

co

it
su√Üces
to
assume
L

an
L

Then

Then

In
