WELCOME TO
Way back in 2009, nobody would have expected a small studio like 
Mojang to take the world by storm with a product like Minecraft. 
Can you even imagine pitching a game like this to a publisher during 
that period? In a market full of big budget shooters and cookie cutter 
open world adventures, where independent games always had to 
struggle for recognition? 
“We are making a game about building whatever you want...but 
there’s no real story in it. There’s also no tutorial, people have to 
figure it out by themselves. You just go around and dig resources 
to build stuff...and there’s creatures trying to kill you sometimes. 
Oh, and the graphics look blocky!” 
It’s hard to think of any big publisher happily funding a project like 
this without batting an eye, but Markus Persson (known to most 
people as “Notch”) stuck to his vision and made the game he wanted 
to play. 
Eight years later, it’s safe to say that he wasn’t the only one that 
wanted to play a game like that.
Minecraft isn’t only a game, it marked the starting point of multiple 
revolutions in the gaming industry. Countless developers and 
publishers took cues from it and continue to do so. 
The gathering, the crafting, the sense of total freedom. The amount 
of elements that have been copied by other games is astounding, to 
the point where even the once criticised graphics have been 
replicated countless times in other products. 
However, among all the things that made Minecraft a worldwide 
phenomenon, the most important of them all are the ones reading 
these words. That’s right: you, the players!
With incredible creations, amazing support and millions of hours 
spent in the game by players in every part of the world, Minecraft’s 
playerbase is its true life and blood.
That’s why we want to welcome you to Minecraft Explorer, a 
companion magazine created with you and the rest of this amazing 
fanbase in mind. 
In every issue we will present you the most relevant news, the 
craziest mods, the most beautiful creations and many guides that 
will help you unleash your creativity in order to shape your perfect 
world, one block at a time. 
 
Stay crafty!

AN EXPLOSION 
OF MINECRAFT 
GOODNESS
F
ans probably expected some 
Minecraft-related news to 
appear at E3, but the news that 
dropped was far more than 
anyone could have imagined. 
PLAY TOGETHER!
One thing that has been a 
consistent inconvenience is that 
there really hasn’t been much in the 
way of cross-platform play. You 
could own the same version of 
Minecraft on different platforms, 
and yet your add-on content 
wouldn’t carry over from one 
version to the next. Mojang  
changed that with the Better 
Together Update, as detailed on 
Minecraft’s official website:
Anyone playing the game on 
Windows 10, iOS, Android, Xbox 
One, Nintendo Switch and VR 
devices are now able to play online 
together. If you own Minecraft for 
your mobile or VR device, you’d 
have received the free update. If 
you own Minecraft: Xbox One 
Edition or Minecraft: Nintendo 
Switch Edition, you’ll have received 
the brand new version of Minecraft 
for free, and your existing worlds 
and DLC will come along to the 
new version with you. What’s more, 
any DLC you purchase will be 
accessible amongst the various 
devices at no extra charge. (For 
example: if you buy the Greek 
Mythology pack on Nintendo 
Switch, you’ll also own it on the 
mobile, Xbox One and Windows 10 
Editions too – no extra charge).
The only downside is that while 
Mojang have pledged to keep 
supporting Minecraft: Java Version 
(as it will be known from here on 
out), this version will be excluded 
from this feature’s implementation. 
That said, if this is the ‘quality of 
life’ thing you’re interested in, you 
probably own at least one of the 
versions that will support it.

In addition, the Better Together 
Update has a server browser

and your friends in the cloud – 
these servers are open to 
everyone! Four servers went 
live at launch with more

IMPROVED GRAPHICS!
December 2017 will see Minecraft  
receive 4K HDR graphics, which will 
include improved lighting, shadows, 
and water effects. Those playing on 
Xbox One, Windows 10, iOS, mobile, 
and VR will be able to take 
advantage. There will also be a 
new piece of DLC, called the Super 
Duper Graphics Pack which will 
crank up your Minecraft 
experience to the next level. 
Granted, nobody has ever played 
Minecraft and ripped on its 
graphics, because the simplistic 
visual aesthetic is part of its 
charm! But who can turn their 
nose up at dynamic shadows, 
lighting that streams through 
fog, movement in leaves and 
grass, new textures for mobs and 
villagers, directional lighting, 
edge highlighting, and more? 
This premium DLC upgrade will 
be accessible to those playing on 
Windows 10 and the Xbox One 
family of consoles.
MINECRAFT: STORY 
MODE– SEASON 2
But maybe you want something a 
little different, perhaps with a bit 
more contextual flavour than the 
typical ‘build and survive’ mantra. 
Mojang is a little too busy 
working to improve the core 
game, but Telltale Games took a 
crack at this with Minecraft: 
Story Mode – Season 1, which 
debuted on multiple platforms in 
the fall of 2015. It was well 
received by critics, fans, and even 
newcomers, so excitement ran 
high when it was announced that 
Minecraft: Story Mode - Season 2 
would be unleashed on July 11th. 
Here’s what people can expect 
this time around:
“Now that Jesse and the gang 
have vanquished the Wither 
Storm, saved the world, and 
become totally super famous 
heroes, life has got a bit more… 
complicated. With more 
responsibilities and less time for 
adventure, old friendships have 
started to fade — at least until

MINECRAFT:  
STORY MODE – SEASON 2
Jesse’s hand gets stuck in a 
creepy gauntlet that belongs to 
an ancient underwater temple. 
Together with old pals and new 
comrades alike, Jesse embarks on 
a brand new journey filled with 
tough choices, good times, and at 
least one temperamental llama.”
Season 2 has 5 episodes but 
Season 1 had 8 under its belt by 
the time all was said and done. It’s 
a great time to be a Minecraft fan!

DISCOVERY AND 
THE MARKETPLACE
DIG YOUR WAY 
OUT OF THIS…
M
inecraft always had an 
inherent sense of adventure, 
but if you’ve yearned for something 
more than Survival Mode, the 
Discovery Update is precisely what 
you’ve been waiting for. Some 
players have enjoyed this content on 
PC since late 2016, but users on 
Windows 10 and mobile platforms 
finally got to try it out this past June.
After obtaining treasure maps 
through trade, you’ll either be 
directed to ocean monuments or 
woodland mansions, where you’ll 
combat guardian, Illagers, and other 
nasties to obtain the Totem of 
Undying. Other additions include 
the Enchantment of Frostwalking, 
Enchantment of Mending, Shulker 
Boxes, more crafting options, and 
A
t the age of 16, Adam Mudd 
created the Titanium Stresser 
program and sold it to 
cybercriminals around the world. 
The actions of Mudd’s clients led 
to the disruption of servers for 
Teamspeak, Xbox Live, PSN, 
Minecraft, and much, much more. 
Mr. Mudd pleaded guilty to one 
count of performing unauthorised 
acts with the intent to impair 
computer operations, one count of 
concealing criminal property, and 
the ability to use llamas for the 
transportation of goods.
Also, thanks to the Minecraft 
Marketplace, players will be able to 
browse, download, and play new 
texture packs, worlds, minigames, 
and more. Content is acquired 
with Minecraft Coins, which are 
purchased with real world money 
and cannot be earned in-
game. Anything you buy 
will carry over to 
multiple devices via 
your Xbox Live 
Account.
While Minecraft 
never gets old, these 
additions will extend 
the game’s longevity 
for sure!

year sentence, which will be served

Seemingly as a Minecraft fan, he 
probably wishes he could craft a 
pickaxe right about now…
OUTSMART ZOMBIES! 
Zombies like busting down 
doors whenever they get the 
chance. Here are some ways 
to keep them from making an 
unwanted entrance: build a 
fence as your door, since 
zombies won’t recognise 
them as doors. Place the 
door perpendicular to the 
hole where one would go. 
This tricks zombies into 
thinking they’re open and 
won’t bother. 

Let’s take a look at five 
very cool, incredible 
Minecraft world seeds 
available for you to check 
out! These seeds were created by some of the most 
ardent, talented players in the Minecraft community. 
Simply grab the seed number and load it up the next 
time you’re creating a Minecraft world, and the game 
will take care of the rest!
Seed: 734603810312601504 (1.11)
This cool (cold?) frozen river contains 
a massive stronghold that houses 
some neat treasures, including 
diamond armour, and a gold ingot. 
The stronghold can be found at 
coordinates 412 80 -1259. At 380 26 
-1245 you will find a portal to the Nether.
Seed: 3657966 (1.8.1)
Hope you’re not afraid of heights! This 
mountain region is so massive it 
breaks through the clouds! You can 
see some beautiful water and lava 
falls. It may be one heck of a trek to 
the top, but along the way you could 
find yourself some very valuable resources.
Seed: 1179340544585804558 (1.11)
This “Winter Getaway” biome features a 
nice village near your spawn point with 
all your fishing and farming needs. On 
the other side you will find the most 
wintry forest you can think of, filled 
with snow-covered trees and ice spikes. 
At 367 / 70 / 99 there is an igloo for your rest-and-relaxation 
needs. Is there something under the rug?
Seed: -860131648790973722 (1.11)
This seed features a very cool mansion 
(844 71 -575) that sits next to some 
snowy hills. At 766 75 -538 you’ll find a 
chest with some redstone in it. There is 
also a village, from the opposite 
direction of where you originally 
spawn. The local smith in there may have some goodies, 
including obsidian.
Seed: 7232427809486241757 (1.11)
Upon immediately spawning, you’ll find a 
mesa to your right. There you’ll find a 
series of abandoned mineshafts for 
some goods and some very valuable 
resources. That’s not the only main 
attraction. There’s also a desert area, home 
to a temple that has some treasures inside, but be wary of any 
traps! Look for a massive village and an amazing array of mountains 
in this seed, too!

DID YOU KNOW?
Beds can be a major asset to your game! Crafting a 
bed (wooden planks and wool) means you can sleep 
in it. Sleeping in a bed will skip the night cycle and 
you can avoid many dangerous mobs that way. Just 
make sure to go to bed at a reasonable hour! Also, 
beds make great spawn points for when you’ve 
really found something worth exploring!

 DIE  IN 
MINECRAFT
Minecraft giveth and Minecraft taketh away. You do 
everything you can to stay alive in the game’s 
Survival or Adventure modes. This is especially true 
when it means you can lose all the items you worked 
so hard to mine, gather, and craft. Sometimes, 
though, death in Minecraft can be a pretty amusing, 
if not a downright hilarious experience! Sometimes 
it can be pretty crazy, too, and players have tried to 
find kooky ways to off their characters. Here are five 
funny, crazy, or scary ways to go in Minecraft!

MINEY MORPHIN’ 
POWER RANGERS
H
aving been on the air for 
over 20 years, the 
Power Rangers franchise 
has withstood the test of 
time, so when a Mighty 
Morphin’ Power Rangers 
skin pack was announced 
for Minecraft on consoles, 
mobile and Windows 10, 
people took notice!
Everyone’s been given 
access to the red and yellow 
rangers for free; however, if 
you’re willing to spend 
$2.99, you’ll get access to 20 
skins. Included are the core 
rangers – red, blue, pink, 
yellow and black – as well as 
the infamous green and 
white rangers. Additionally, 
you’ll also receive Alpha 5, 
Goldar, Rita 
Repulsa, Lord 
Zedd, Ninjor, the 
Megazord, and 
everyone’s 
favourite bumbling duo, 
Bulk and Skull. 
Mike Fielder, one of the 
artists who worked on the 
skin pack, had fond 
memories of the program 
and wanted this content to 
be special. “I hope everyone 
who uses these skins has as 
much fun playing them as I 
did creating them.” 
You wouldn’t think so, but 
these characters have 
translated to Minecraft 
extremely well. Fans of the 
original series will 
undoubtedly appreciate 
the work that Mike Fielder, 
as well as the other artists 
he worked with, has put 
into this!
The Floor Is Hot Lava or 
Swimming in Lava
In-game message: [Player] 
tried to swim in lava.
Chances are during your 
Minecraft adventure, you’ll 
eventually want to see what 
the offerings are underground, and you’d be surprised 
how massive the underground area is in the game. Or 
maybe you built the portal to the Nether, which has a 
plentiful supply of hot lava to avoid. Regardless, the 
more you dig down, the more likely you’ll meet a fiery, 
liquid-y end.
2
Death By a Thousand Pricks or 
Death by Cactus
In-game message: [Player] 
hugged a cactus.
Why does death by cacti rank 
so highly? It takes a long time 
to be killed by an innocent 
cactus and the very thought of that sounds too absurd to 
not make the list. You would have to actively TRY to hurt 
yourself if you’re near a cactus, but some mobs can back 
you into one. Cacti, however, are a good source of sugar 
cane, so proceed with caution. Most importantly, you 
shouldn’t hug a cactus.
What a Creep! Or Creeper 
Explosion
In-game message: [Player] was 
slain by [mob].
These guys really are 
troublemakers, aren’t they? 
Just like our mob guide describes, Minecraft’s famous 
creepers are the silent but deadly type. You don’t know 
they’re behind you until you hear that nerve-racking 
hissing sound and then BOOM! There’s a big new crater 
where you were once standing.

IT’S SWITCH-CRAFT!
W
ell, that was fast! Mojang and 
4J have brought Minecraft to 
the Nintendo Switch! But why 
should people have more interest 
in this version over the rest?
“It’s-a me! Mario!” 
Much like the Wii-U version, it 
comes with 40 Super Mario-
themed skins, the Mushroom 
Kingdom remade in block form 
by professional Minecraft 
builders, and selections from 
Super Mario 64’s score for the 
nostalgic gamer to enjoy!
The game runs at 60 frames-per-
second in both portable and docked 
modes, only dipping to 30 while 
flying over a particularly dense 
jungle. Furthermore, draw distance 
takes a hit while playing on-the-go, 
but overall, Minecraft runs like a 
dream. Better yet, the maximum 
world size has been increased from 
the Wii-U’s 864 x 864 blocks to 
3072 x 3072 (compared to 5120 x 
5120 on the Xbox One and PS4).
Online play is surprisingly stable and 
it’s always easy to see which of your 
friends are currently playing. For local 
play, a second controller is required. 
Already own it on the Wii-U? Don’t 
worry! If you buy Minecraft on the 
Switch, you’ll be able to import your 
worlds in the future.
The Mario content coupled with 
the Switch’s portability arguably 
makes this the best version of the 
game to date!
REMEMBER TO...
Write your coordinates down! They’re the numbers 
that appear next to XYZ. Chances are you may come 
across an area rich in ore deposit or other valuables 
and you’ll have to make preparations for your 
excavation. It may be pretty far away from where your 
base or home is located and Minecraft maps can get 
pretty massive. You don’t want to forget and then 
have your treasures and riches be lost forever!

TAKE A BOW!
This toy is an exact replica of the 
bow and arrow used in Minecraft, 
and it’s much more functional 
than its blocky look would lead 
you to believe. The front of the 
bow has a hole where the arrow 
can slide through. The back of 
the arrow has a groove which 
allows the pixelised string 
(encased in rubber) to seat 
comfortably until you’re ready to 
fire. With minimal effort, even 
children can pull back, release, 
and let the arrow fly. The tip of 
the arrow is constructed of 
rubbery foam, 
ensuring nobody 
on the receiving 
end of an 
explorer’s target 
practice gets hurt. 
MAKIN’ ME PLUSH!
The Minecraft plush line includes the 
animals of the land, such as pigs, sheep, 
wolves and more. Things get more 
impressive once the villains are taken 
into account. Creepers and skeletons 
are decent lower priced options, but if 
you want something a little more 
substantial, there’s larger plush 
available like a spider, not to mention 
the Enderman and Enderdragon. There’s 
a common misconception that plush 
toys are meant for babies, eventually 
destined to become garbage bin 
fodder, but that’s simply not 
true. Sure, their primary 
purpose might be for play, 
but for the most 
obsessive Minecraft 
fan, they can also be 
used for display.
LEGOLISE IT!
Minecraft is a world that’s composed entirely by blocks, so 
naturally, forming a partnership with LEGO was natural, if 
not inevitable. For anyone who’s patient, loves to build 
things, and has a wallet busting at the seams with cash, 
there are enough sets available for people to make an 
impressively large, physical representation of the in-game world. 
You can start your adventure with The First Night, emerge 
victorious from a battle with The Enderdragon, or anything in 
between. Other sets include The Wither, The Jungle Tree House, 
The End, The Iron Golem, The Nether Fortress, The Desert 
Outpost, The Snow Hideout, The Dungeon, The Fortress,  
The Farm, The Cave, and a Crafting Box.

STICK TO THE WALLS!
Moveable and reusable wall graphics are one of the 
most efficient ways to nerd up your living quarters. 
As long as you’re careful, they won’t crinkle or rip 
like posters, you won’t have to put unsightly holes in 
your wall, and they won’t rip any paint off the wall 
when you take them down. 
The official Minecraft wall decals are available in a 
variety of otherworldly flavours. One is designed 
after The Nether, and features a Zombie Pigman and 
Ghast. Another is modelled after The End, placing 
none other than the Enderdragon front and centre. 
For something less dark, you can put up a pig coming 
out of a mineshaft in a cart. If you’re looking for 
something more character-centric, there are also 
decals of the Enderman and Flying Squid. 
HEADS UP!
These lightweight cardboard masks 
make cosplay easy. Designed to be 
exact replicas of the heads of your 
favourite Minecraft characters, all 
you have to do is slip them on, wear 
the appropriate coloured clothing 
and you’ve got yourself a 
costume! Each mask measures 
approximately 12 inches square, 
which should fit most people. 
Basic assembly is required as the 
cardboard ships flat, but setup is 
a breeze.
CREEP AROUND!
Other than Steve, the Creeper is one of Minecraft’s most 
notorious villains. This backpack resembles that character 
model. The designers have wisely chosen to not make this an 
exact replica, instead opting for a thematic approach. At first 
glance, the first thing people see is a green backpack with a 
black and dark green checkerboard pattern striped across the 
bottom. It’s only upon a closer look that they’ll notice the blocks 
of light green peppered all over, meaning this product can be 
appreciated by Minecraft fans while still being elegant enough 
for any situation. Featured are dual main zippered 
compartments, an interior laptop sleeve, a comfortable padded 
back, adjustable shoulder straps and a durable reinforced 
bottom. So whether you’re going to school or a sleepover, you’ll 
feel confident in knowing this backpack supports your needs. 
CRAFT YOUR MEMOIRS!
Designed and embossed with Minecraft’s 
wood texture, this journal gives new meaning 
to ‘hardcover’. Contained within are 80 pages 
for you to fill with whatever your heart desires. 
You could write tips and tricks to make this 
the perfect companion while playing the 
game, draw Minecraft-inspired art, use it for 
school or work, or even use it as a diary. This 
product measures approximately 7.5” x 7.5”.

C O M P A N I O N
Minecraft can be intimidating for newcomers, 
unless you’re playing on a console or mobile 
device, as they come with a built-in tutorial. 
People playing the original Java version on PC 
shouldn’t be disheartened though, as the game’s 
Survival Mode really isn’t difficult once you learn 
how to manage both your time and resources. 
For the uninitiated, each new game of Minecraft 
is never the same as the last. When starting off 
on a new save file, a unique, randomised world is 
generated for the user, littered with a variety of 
biomes to mess around in. These include plains, 
forests, swamps, jungles, tundras, deserts, 
islands, and the ocean. Some of these may not 
sound like a good place to begin, but Minecraft 
has a number of built-in failsafes to ensure you’ll 
spawn somewhere that provides the basic 
essentials. Once the world is generated and 
you’re ready to explore, what comes next is a 
matter of knowing what you need to get started, 
how to go about getting it, and how to stay out of 
trouble. Once you’ve mastered the very basics of 
beginning your adventure in the land of blocks, 
the world is yours to do with as you please. But 
until then, Minecraft Explorer is going to provide 
you with the tips and tricks you need to get 
there. We’ll cover your first days in the 
Overworld, break down the various creatures 
you’ll encounter, and how to perform more 
complex tasks such as breeding and farming. 
Hectic lifestyle or not, you should feel confident 
enough to play this game in no time.

Where to Begin: Because each world is 
generated at random, you could spawn 
within a few different biomes. 
Experienced players may be able to 
survive wherever, but newcomers should 
make every possible effort to go where 
there’s plenty of grass and trees. If you 
don’t want to swim off an island or run 
through a desert to find such a place, 
you could always ditch your current 
save, start over, and spawn in a more 
agreeable location. Unless you’re lucky 
enough to find yourself next to a village, 
jungle biomes are probably your best 
bet. They’re littered with large trees, and 
as we’ll discuss in a moment, trees are 
good. If you’re near thick, short trees, 
however, you’re in a roofed forest biome. 
There are materials aplenty, but the 
canopy of leaves can block out the sun 
and cause monsters to spawn/live 
during the daytime, and that’s a hassle 
you don’t need while trying to figure 
things out.
HOW TO GET 
STARTED
IN MINECRAFT

Mark Your Territory: Remembering 
where you’ve spawned is important in 
Minecraft. Until you’ve mastered the game 
and you’re ready to move on, it’s the most 
efficient place to gather materials and 
build a shelter. However, you may have 
trouble remembering where this spot is 
after you’ve done a bit of exploring. Biomes 
can be quite large, and until you’ve grown 
accustomed to the area, you’re going to 
want a large, unique landmark so you can 
always find your way back ‘home’. So, why 
not build one? Dig at the ground beneath 
your feet. Once you’ve collected enough 
dirt, stack them on end to make a sizeable 
tower. Another way to find your way back is 
less desirable, and that’s by dying.  [01]
Gather Some Wood: You’re not going 
to accomplish anything else in this game 
without tools, so get acquainted with wood 
quick because it’s about to become your 
best friend. Look for the nearest tree and 
use your bare fists on it. You’ll collect wood 
with each block you break, so keep going 
until you have about four trees’ worth in 
your inventory.
Constructing the Basics: After you’ve 
collected enough ‘logs’, open your 
inventory. Click and drag a log into the 
crafting area. Each log will break down into 
4 planks. Now you can build a crafting 
table, which is required to make more 
complex tools and items. Just place a 
wooden plank in each of the 4 squares of 
your inventory’s crafting grid (2 x 2) to 
build it. [02] [03]
Build a Pickaxe: Mining is obviously a 
core aspect of the game, so you’re going to 
want a pickaxe. With it, you’ll be able to 
collect stone and coal, which allows you to 
make stronger, more durable weapons and 
torches. Open up your inventory and place 
planks in the two right boxes to make 4 
sticks. With these in hand, go to your table 
and open its crafting grid. You’ll notice it’s 
larger than the one in your inventory (3 x 
3), but there’s no need to get overwhelmed 
because you’re staring at 9 squares now 
instead of 4. While guessing the right 
combination to build something may seem 
like a fruitless endeavour, you can conquer 
crafting with one simple tip:
[02]
[03]

COMPANION

Material placement is vital, but that also 
takes little more than common sense. To 
build the pickaxe for example, place 
wooden planks in the top three boxes (for 
the wooden head) and sticks in the leftover 
boxes down the middle (for the handle). 
This pickaxe isn’t the most reliable, but 
you’ll need it to get materials for stronger 
gear and weapons. [04]
[05]
Gather Stone: At this point you can 
either make wooden tools and weapons, or 
gather stone to make stronger gear. Take 
the latter route, as wooden items have 
poor durability. It should be easy to find a 
bit of stone, but if you don’t see any in your 
vicinity, dig below the surface with your 
hands until you’ve found some. Don’t dig 
straight down, as you’ll waste precious 
time digging your way back out. Instead, 
make a staircase as you descend. Use your 
pickaxe and gather enough cobblestone to 
upgrade it and make a stone shovel, axe, 
sword, furnace, and hoe. 
Building Stone Items: 
Making a stone pickaxe should be a piece 
of cake. Use the same formula as before, 
but instead of using planks for the head, 
use cobblestone. [06]
If you want to slay mobs of animals and 
monsters, you’re going to want a durable 
sword. Without it, you’d soon meet your 
maker. Monsters can gang up on you, and 
you don’t want hunting for food to become 
an event because you ran off into the 
wilderness without a proper blade. [23]
You may have dug into the earth with your 
bare hands, but shovels will break grass, 
dirt, gravel, clay, and sand much faster.  
[04]

YOU WANT TO BUILD 
INSIDE THE GRID. 
IT’S REALLY THAT 
SIMPLE.

If you make your way to a biome filled with 
snow, they can even be used to gather 
snowballs. [07]
As you’re aware by now, wood is essential 
to everything at this stage of the game, so 
you’ll want an axe for faster collection. 
After all, time is a precious commodity in 
Minecraft, so make sure you use every 
second of available daylight to your 
advantage! [08]
Hoes are used for farming, which you likely 
won’t get to until your second day at the 
earliest (depending on your gameplay 
style). Still, since you’ve been in collect and 
craft mode anyway, it wouldn’t hurt to 
make one now. [09]
In the Meantime…: As soon as you’ve 
crafted your sword, keep a vigilant eye out 
for animals. Managing your hunger is very 
much a part of the Minecraft experience, 
so you’re going to need to hunt and 
subsequently cook your food. Don’t go out 
of your way to hunt, as hunger won’t kick in 
for a while, but the more food you can 
gather early on, the better. 
It’s worth noting that hunger will affect you 
differently depending on the level of 
difficulty you’ve chosen. You won’t literally 
starve to death unless you’re playing on 
Hard mode, but the consequence on 
Normal isn’t much kinder, as your health 
will continually drop until you’re left with a 
measly 1%. You’ll lose half your total health 
on Easy mode, and hunger becomes a non-
issue on Peaceful. [10]
Shelter: You’ll be fine during the day, but 
once darkness envelops the land, it’s a 
good idea to seek shelter. Monsters come 
out at night, and even though you’re 
armed with a sword, it’s best to stay out of 
[23]
[08]
[09]

their way until you have a way to replenish 
your health. As a beginner, you likely won’t 
have time to build a shelter on the first 
day, so dig a hidey hole into the ground or 
make a small cave on the side of a 
mountain, making sure to cover the 
opening. You can use blocks of material for 
this, or craft a door. [14]
Spending the night this way can be kind of 
creepy, because you’ll hear zombie moans 
and the rattling of skeleton bones as you 
wait hopelessly inside. Of course, you could 
make better use of this time to mine your 
way deeper underground, collecting 
valuable resources such as coal and iron 
ore, but you risk coming face-to-face with a 
dangerous foe. Once the monsters stop 
making noise, it’s likely morning. Monsters 
burn up in sunlight, so it’s safe to go 
outside and continue your journey. You 
may spot a skeleton or zombie that was 
lucky enough to remain shaded under a 
tree, but you can trick them into coming 
out by getting close enough to let them 
see you.
[10]
[14]
TIRED OF USING BLOCKS TO CLOSE 
YOUR SHELTER EACH NIGHT?  
BUILD A DOOR! IT’S FAR MORE 
CONVENIENT FOR COMING  
AND GOING. IT’S ALSO GREAT  
FOR KEEPING MOBS OUT!

C O M P A N I O N
FIRST DAYS IN MINECRAFT

The first shelter you get around to building 
should be small, but large enough to fit a 
furnace, crafting table, storage chest, bed, 
and a small entrance to mine underground. 
It doesn’t really matter what you make it 
out of, but using cobblestone brings a 
peace of mind that dirt can’t. It’s also 
highly resistant to explosions and can’t 
catch fire! If you’ve still got wood in your 
inventory and managed to collect wool 
from a sheep, you could also make a bed. 
Beds allow you to sleep through the night 
so you don’t have to wait for monsters to 
go away. [11]
[12]
Fire It Up!: The furnace in Minecraft is 
multi-functional, as it not only cooks 
collected meat, but also allows making 
coal and the smelting of materials. The 
furnace grid works different than crafting, 
as there’s only two squares you have to 
deal with. You’ll need to add the item you 
want to cook/burn/smelt in the top box, 
and a source of fuel in the bottom. Coal is a 
highly efficient fuel for your furnace. Wood 
works as well, but also burns a lot quicker. 
Cook whatever meat you’ve managed to 
collect, and if you haven’t gone mining for 
coal, burn some wood in order to make 
some. [13]
[16]
Torches are going to make life much 
more convenient in the evening. Any 
block in Minecraft with a light level of 7 
or below is an eligible spawn point for 
mobs, so place torches in your mine, 
around your shelter, and beyond. 
Torches have a light level of 14 on the 
square they’re placed, 13 on adjacent 
squares, and the numbers diminish by 1 
with each additional square out. Placing 
torches no further than 13 squares apart 
should keep your area free of mob 
spawns. However, mobs will still charge if 
they see you, so take the time to plant 
enough torches to feel safe.[15]
Mining: Now that you’re set with a 
weapon, tools, and a shelter complete 
with furnace, it’s time to collect 
additional resources. Dig into a mountain 
or underground until you hit stone. Keep 
going until you find squares with bits of 
light brown sprinkled around it. That’s 
iron ore, and you’ll want to toss them 
into the furnace to make iron ingots. 
With these, you’ll not only be able to 
make stronger tools and weapons, but 
armour, buckets, anvils, cauldrons, and 
more. For now, work on getting enough 
iron ingots to craft a bucket. Buckets 
allow you to carry lava, milk, and water, 
the latter of which will be important for 
farming (more on that later). Gather any 
coal you find, too. [17]
[18]
Farming: Near your shelter, either find 
a nice and flat plot of land, or make one 
by digging out some dirt and/or 
chopping away at stone. 9 x 9 or 11 x 11 
is all you’ll need at this stage of the 
game. Build an enclosure around it so 
hostile mobs can’t hop in and trample 
your efforts. If you haven’t already done 
so in your travels, walk around and hack 
at pieces of tall grass. Some will drop 
seeds, but before planting them you’ll 
need to craft a hoe and till the earth. Of 
course, you can’t grow crops without 
water, so you’re going to have to install 
a water system. Nothing fancy, but 
there are a couple of options at your 
disposal. If a source of water is nearby, 
you can carve a trench, leading the 
water directly to your crops. If water is 
far away enough to make that 
unfeasible, use the bucket you’ve 
crafted and go on a water run. Once you 
return, dig a small hole in the centre of 
your plot and manually fill it with water.

In a few moments you’ll see the once 
dry earth change to a healthy dark 
brown. Now you can plant your seeds 
and watch your first supply of wheat 
come to life. Make sure not to harvest 
your crop until it’s matured, or all you’ll 
end up with are more seeds. Each fully 
grown crop will provide 1 wheat and 0 to 
3 seeds. After collecting a bunch of 
wheat, you can then use it to make 
bread. Now that you’ve built a basic crop 
farm, you won’t always have to hunt for 
food!  [19] [20]
Extra Storage: You’re collecting a ton 
of materials now, and your inventory 
will only allow you to carry so much. 
Fortunately, you can craft a storage 
chest and toss anything you’re not 
currently using inside. You’ll only need 
one of these in your initial shelter, but 
once you’re ready to move on and build a 
proper home, you’ll have room for as 
many storage chests as you want. [21]
Congratulations! Now You Know 
the Basics!: Because Minecraft is 
such an incredibly in-depth game, 
there’s so much more to do. However, 
you now have the mental building 
blocks to begin your adventure. 
Continue to experiment with different 
crafting formulas, smelting, farming, 
and building… and that’s only the 
beginning. In the pages to come, we’ll 
give you an extensive breakdown on 
creatures and their habits, tiers of 
weapons and armour, breeding, 
farming, as well as some information 
on what limitations you’ll face based 
on the platform you’re playing on. If 
you’re left with additional questions, 
feel free to look online. The Minecraft 
community has always been an 
essential tool for learning the game, 
but of course, always keep an eye on 
Minecraft Explorer, the best Minecraft 
companion money can buy! [22]

lthough it feels like you’re on 
your own sometimes in 
Minecraft, there’s a pretty 
good chance you’ll run into one or 
more of the game’s many creatures, 
known collectively as “Mobs”. Some 
mobs are harmless and can be pretty 
helpful to your resources, some may 
not be aggressive unless provoked, 
and others can be downright nasty 
and chase you to the ends of the 
earth. Many enemies can simply be 
punched away, or they can be 
trapped or you can simply run away. 
Some may require a little firepower.
Mobs behave in certain ways and 
interact with the environment in 
certain ways. They are subject to the 
same environmental harms as the 
player, so they’re capable of being 
attacked, or drowning, or hurting 
themselves from great heights, for 
example. They’ll do their best to 
avoid these. Certain mobs, like 
chickens, cows, or tamed animals, 
run away upon any danger. Neutral 
mobs, such as cave spiders or 
Endermen, will attack if provoked. 
Then there are the hostile mobs who 
will attack on sight.

BAT - HP: 6 (), Attack: 0 
Bats tend to spawn in 
cave areas and areas with 
a light level of 3 or less and below layer 
63. Between 20 October - 3 November, 
they only require a light level of 6 or 
less to spawn. They are entirely 
harmless.
CHICKEN - HP: 4 (), 0-3 XP  
Chickens are one of a number 
of mobs that can breed (more 
on breeding on Page 42). If a player 
throws an egg, there is a ⅛ chance of a 
baby chicken hatching. Baby chickens 
will grow in or around 20 minutes. 
Adult chickens will sometimes drop 
feathers that are used to craft the bow 
and arrow (more on crafting on Page 
38). They will also drop 1 raw chicken 
(restores 2), though if one is downed 
by fire it will drop 1 cooked chicken (6).
COW - HP: 10 (), 1-3 XP for 
killing, 1-7 XP for breeding  
Cows will spawn in herds of  
4 with at least 2 block spaces above 
them at light level 9. Feeding cows 
wheat will trigger their breeding to 
breed a calf. Holding wheat will get 
them to follow you. Adult cows will drop 
anywhere between 0-2 leather, 1-3 raw 
beef (restores 3), and cows killed by 
fire will drop 1-3 steak (restores 8).  
Use an empty bucket on cows to get 
milk (more on crafting and resources 
on Page 18).
MOOSHROOM - HP: 10 (),  
1-3 XP for killing, 1-7 XP for 
breeding  
Mooshrooms are cows that breed and 
spawn in mushroom island biomes. 
Mooshrooms exhibit the same 
characteristics as cows (see above), 
meaning they will wander aimlessly 
and avoid perils such as high cliffs and 
lava. Mooshrooms will also give milk, 
though using a bowl will give players a 
mushroom stew. Mooshrooms also 
drop the same items. 
PIG - HP: 10 (), 1-3 XP for 
killing, 1-7 XP for breeding  
A common mob that grows on 
grass blocks, pigs follow similar 
behavioural patterns as other passive 
mobs and usually hang in groups of 4. 
“PASSIVE” MOBS WILL NOT ATTACK THE 
PLAYER AND LIKELY RUN AWAY IF ATTACKED.

Using a saddle on them makes them 
rideable. Baby pigs do not drop items 
nor XP, but adult pigs will drop a raw 
porkchop (3), or if on fire, a cooked 
porkchop (8). To get a pig to follow you, 
equip any of the following: beetroot, 
potato, carrot, or carrot on a stick.
SHEEP - HP: 8 (), 1-3 XP for 
killing, 1-7 XP for breeding 
Most sheep you’re going to 
encounter will be white, but there is a 
slight chance you run into ones of 
differing wool shades including dark 
grey, grey, and black. Sheep will drop 1 
wool of the same colour if killed, 
though shearing them could drop 
more. Wool can also be dyed (see more 
in Crafting). Killing a sheep will also 
drop a raw mutton (2) or, if killed by 
fire, a cooked mutton (6).
RABBIT - HP: 3 (), 1-3 XP for 
killing, 1-4 for breeding  
You’ll find rabbits in a variety of 
areas from deserts to cold mountains, 
usually in groups of 2 or 3. Rabbits will 
drop 1 rabbit hide and 1 raw rabbit (3). 
If a rabbit dies while on fire, it will drop  
1 cooked rabbit (5). They can, but

“NEUTRAL” MOBS ARE 
PASSIVE UNLESS THE PLAYER 
PROVOKES OR ATTACKS THEM.
SPIDER - HP: 16 (x8), Attack: 
2 HP Easy/Normal, 3 HP 
Hard, 5 XP when killed - Cave Spider 
- HP: 12   
Spiders are generally not hostile unless 
they are at certain light levels or if they 
are attacked by the player. Cave 
spiders can poison the player, which 
continuously drains health for a certain 
amount of time depending on the 
difficulty level selected. Spiders can 
climb walls and most obstacles. 
Spiders will drop 0-2 string, a very 
useful and basic item used to craft 
bows and fishing rods and the like. On 
rare occasions, they may also drop a 
spider’s eye, used in poisonous 
potions. Aside from differences in 
attack, cave spiders and spiders tend 
to exhibit the same behaviours.
ENDERMAN - HP: 40 (x20), 
Attack : 4 (Easy), 7 (Normal), 
10 HP (Hard), 5 XP when killed  
One of the weirdest mobs, Enderman 
sports long arms and legs and spawns 
across all dimensions of Minecraft’s 
worlds, sometimes in groups of 4. 
While entirely neutral, it is advised not 
to attack or even stare at their heads or 
else they get pretty hostile. They’re 
weak to water and are able to teleport 
away from harm. If killed, the 
Enderman may drop an ender pearl 
used in crafting.
rarely, drop a rabbit’s foot used in 
potions. Rabbits will hop aimlessly in 
search of vegetables.
SQUID - HP: 10 (), 1-3 XP  
for killing  
Squid will spawn in most water 
layers (oceans only in Pocket Edition). 
Squid exhibit the same behaviour as 
land passive mobs. Killing a squid will 
net 1-3 XP. It is possible for a squid to 
die on dry land. Squids will also drop 
anywhere from 1-3 ink sacs.
VILLAGER - HP: 20 (x10),  
3-6 XP when trading, 8-11 XP 
when trading while willing 
Villagers are perhaps the economic 
heart of Minecraft. They wander in their 
villages until nightfall. The player can 
trade them emeralds for better 
equipment or food, depending on the 
profession. Villagers come in a variety 
of professions: farmer, librarian, 
blacksmith, priest, butcher, and nitwit 
as indicated by their tunics. Villagers 
are capable of mating depending on 
the number of doors in a village. 
Villagers killed by zombies have a 
chance to turn into one depending on 
the difficulty level.

POLAR BEAR - HP: 30 (x15), 
Attack: 4 HP (Easy), 6 HP

Polar bears, much like real life, live in icy 
conditions. Adults fall under neutral 
behaviour while cubs are passive. Also 
like real life, adult polar bears are likely 
to see you as a threat if you get near 
their cubs. When killed, polar bears 
may drop raw fish and raw salmon. 
They cannot drop cooked items.
ZOMBIE PIGMAN - HP: 20 
(x10), Attack: 5 HP (Easy),  
9 HP (Normal), 13 HP (Hard), 
5 XP when killed   
Spawn in the Nether or when lightning 
strikes near a pig. They also always 
carry a golden sword with them. These 
guys have a chance of spawning with 
pumpkins every 31 October.

These flaming guys, usually found in 
the Nether, can fly but love to stay on 
the ground. They’ll shoot fireballs as 
long as they stay ablaze. Best 
defeated by water or ice items.
CHICKEN JOCKEY - HP: 20 
(x10), Attack: 2 HP, 3 HP, 4 HP, 
Pigman chicken jockey attack: 
5 HP (Easy), 9 HP (Normal), 13 HP 
(Hard), 10 XP for chicken death,  
12 for baby zombie death   
An incredibly rare spawn, the chicken 
jockey consists of a baby zombie or 
Pigman riding a chicken. They move 
at the same behavioural pattern as 
zombies. May drop rotten flesh or 
gold nuggets.
CREEPER - HP: 20 (x10), 
Attack: Varies by proximity,  
5 XP when killed 
Possibly one of the most famous 
mobs in Minecraft, the creeper 
silently (like, really silently) stalks you 
from behind and explodes, possibly 
doing enough damage to down you. 
Using flint or steel on them will force 
the creeper to explode. Creepers will 
drop gunpowder, and if killed by a 
skeleton arrow it will also drop a 
music disc. A charged creeper, one 
that is struck by lightning, receives 
even more massive explosive power.
GUARDIAN - HP: 30 (x15), 
Attack: 2 HP (spikes), 5 HP 
(Easy), 8 HP (Normal), 12 HP (Hard), 
10 XP when killed  
Guardians are fish-like creatures that 
spawn near ocean monuments. When 
they aren’t swimming they will have 
spikes released from their bodies. Unlike 
squids, guardians can live indefinitely 
without water and will have their spikes 
extended on land. Guardians drop raw 
fish, cooked fish if killed with fire, and 
prismarine crystals used in crafting.
ELDER GUARDIAN - HP: 80 
(x40), Attack: 2 (spikes), 5 HP 
(Easy), 8 HP (Normal), 12 HP (Hard), 
10 XP when killed  
Elder Guardians exhibit the same 
behaviour as guardians. However, it will 
not retreat when swimming closer to it. 
In fact, it’ll cook up a pretty powerful 
laser that reduces mining speed and 
attack – fatigue for all intents and 
purposes. Elder guardians also drop 
prismarine crystals and raw fish, cooked 
fish if killed with fire.
ENDERMITE - HP:8 (),

Endermites are the smallest hostile 
mobs. They will attack the player from 
within a 16-block radius. They do not 
drop anything but give 3 experience 
points upon defeat. They typically 
spawn when an ender pearl is used.
EVOKER - HP: 24 (x12),  
Attack: 6 HP, 10 XP when killed 
Known as one of the Illagers, the 
evoker is found near the woodland 
mansion. It will attack the player within 
a 16-block radius and will retreat when 
the player attempts an attack. The 
evoker casts three attack types: a fang 
spell, a vex summon, and a sheep 
colour-changing spell. It will always 
drop a totem of undying, which saves a 
player from death, and may drop an 
emerald.
VEX - HP: 14 (x7), Attack:  
5 HP (Easy), 9 HP (Normal),  
13 HP (Hard), 3 XP when killed  
Vexes are spawned by the summon of 
an evoker. Look for some white smoke 
and a weird horn sound and that 
means there’s one nearby. They’re 
IRON GOLEM - 100 HP (x 50), 
Attack: 4 HP to 31 HP by difficulty, 
no XP  
Iron golems will spawn in villages with at least 
10 villagers present. They can also be created 
by arranging four iron blocks in a T shape, 
followed lastly by a jack o’lantern above the 
centre block. Once created or spawned, they 
will assume a patrol if in the village, otherwise, 
they will wander aimlessly. Golems will offer 
poppies to villagers as a symbol of friendship. 
Upon death, they will drop iron ingots and 
sometimes poppies.
SNOW GOLEM - 4 HP (), Attack: 3 HP 
to Blazes, no XP  
Stack two snow blocks and a pumpkin or 
jack o’lantern head and you’ve got yourself a 
snow golem. These guys can’t live in warmer 
temperatures or anywhere it rains, otherwise 
they’ll naturally melt! Snow golems do not take 
fall damage. They love throwing snowballs to 
push hostile mobs away, but are able to inflict 
damage on Blaze mobs.

19 HP (Hard), 5 XP when killed  
Vindicators is another known Illager, an 
axe-wielding maniac that will 
automatically attack the player when 
near. These guys spawn near the 
woodland mansion. However, you can 
get them to calm down if you put an 
iron door between yourself and them. 
Killing a Vindicator may cause them to 
drop their axe as well as an emerald.
GHAST - HP: 10 (), Attack:

hanging around the Nether. While these 
guys won’t pursue you like other 
hostiles, ghasts have a devastating 
fireball attack that does major damage 
depending on how close you are. The 
best way to evade is to get out of its line 
of sight! Ghasts drop gunpowder and 
sometimes a ghast tear when downed.
ZOMBIE - HP:20 (x10), 
Attack: 2, 3, 4, 5 XP for 
killing an adult zombie,  
12 XP for killing a baby zombie  
The zombie, like the creeper,  
is probably one of the most 
recognisable mobs in Minecraft. 
Zombies tend to appear at night 
in groups of 4, but if a player is in 
a village with at least 20 doors, there 
could be a siege in which up to 20 
zombies appear to terrorise the 
neighborhood. Zombies can infect 
villagers, turning them in effect. This 
can be cured with a golden apple. In 
desert biomes, zombies are often 
spawned as husks. Though zombies 
may appear mindless, fighting them 
could get tough if they pick up dropped 
items because they will use them, and 
that includes armour and weapons. 
Zombies may drop rotten flesh, which 
is not recommended you eat lest you 
get food poisoning!
SLIME - Tiny HP: 1 (), Small 4 
HP (),  Big 16 HP (x 8), Attack 
0 HP, 2 HP, 4 HP, 1-4 XP when killed 
Slimes come in a few sizes and mostly 
spawn near swamps. They’ll hop about 
erratically even if there is no proximity 
to the player. Slime are capable of 
twice the melee attacks in one second 
as opposed to other hostiles. Slime 
may drop slimeballs when killed, used 
for crafting.
MAGMA CUBE - Tiny HP: 1 (), 
Small 4 HP (),  Big 16 HP (x 8), 
Armour: Tiny 3,  Small 6 , Big 
12, Attack: Tiny 3 HP, Small 4 HP, Big

6 HP, 1-4 XP when killed  
Magma cubes are a variation of 
slimes, and may break into 
smaller units . Magma cubes are 
found exclusively in the Nether. 
Because they are entirely made 
of magma, they cannot be 
damaged by fire or lava. Like the slime, 
their attack speed is double that of 
other melee-focused mobs.
SILVERFISH - HP: 8 (), 
Attack: 1 HP, 5 XP when killed  
Bug-like creatures that spawn in high 
biomes, igloo basements, or spawn out 
of monster eggs, these guys will call for 
help when attacked. Idle ones will find a 
stone block to turn into a monster egg. 
There are no other drops for silverfish 
except for 5 experience points.
SKELETON - HP: 20 (x10), 
Attack: Bow 4 HP (Easy),  
4 HP (Normal), 5 HP (Hard), 
Sword: 2 HP (Easy), 2 HP (Normal),  
3 HP (Hard), 5 XP when killed  
Skeletons tend to like dim places for 
spawning and will burn up in sunlight. 
They tend to carry bows but will also 
carry swords occasionally. Should a 
player step on a skeleton trap, skeleton 
riders will spawn. Skeletons that spawn 
in frozen areas and biomes are strays 
and their arrows will induce slowness 
for about 30 seconds. These guys like 
to chase and will traverse certain 
obstacles to find a good vantage point 
to get shots at you, so watch out!
WITHER SKELETON - HP: 20 
(x10), Attack: 4 HP, 7 HP, 10 HP, 
5 XP when killed   
Wither skeletons will walk pretty 
slowly until it spots the player. They 
attack with a sword that turns the 
player’s health black and withers away 
every few seconds. Don’t even bother 
with any fire attacks as they’re 
immune. Wither skeletons may drop 1 
coal and 0-2 bones.
SHULKER - HP: 30 (x 15), 20 
Armour points when closed, 
Attack: 4 HP, 5 XP when killed  
You’re likely to find the shulker near the 
End city in the End, the final dimension 
in Minecraft. They like to camouflage 
themselves, blending in with the End’s 
purpur blocks. When the player is near, 
it will open up its shell and fire 
projectiles. Its armour is impervious to 
arrows so it isn’t worth trying. The 
shulker may drop its shell upon defeat, 
used for crafting items.
 
WITCH - HP: 26 (x 13)  
While witches do not have any 
attack power per se, they will use 
splash potions both offensively 
(slowless and poison) as well as 
defensively. They will spawn anywhere 
near witch huts. Lightning that strikes 
within 3 or 4 blocks of a villager has a 
chance of turning them into a witch. 
Upon defeat, a witch will drop any of 
several items, including gunpowder, 
redstone, glass bottle, spider eyes, etc.

HORSE - HP: 15 to 30  (x 15)  
“Horse” in Minecraft is 
perhaps a catch-all name for 
various rideable mammals that can be 
tamed to also include donkeys and 
mules. They spawn in plains and 
savannahs in herds. Simply mount the 
horse repeatedly (it will keep bucking) 
until hearts appear on the user 
interface. Only then can equipment 
like saddles and armour be used on 
“BOSS” MOBS ARE 
RESISTANT TO A LOT 
OF STATUS EFFECTS, 
AND WILL PUT UP A LONG 
FIGHT FOR THE PLAYER.
“TAMEABLE” MOBS 
ARE MOBS THAT, 
THROUGH CERTAIN 
EFFORTS, CAN

ALLIES AND 
SOMETIMES EVEN 
MODES OF

ENDER DRAGON - HP: 200 
(x100), Attack: 6 HP (Easy),  
10 HP (Hard), 15 HP (Hard), 
Breath attack: 6 HP, Exploding fireball: 
12 HP, 12,000 XP on first kill, 500 XP 
every subsequent kill  
The Ender dragon is a powerful creature 
that exists solely in the End. It has four 
behavioural patterns: circling the ring of 
pillars (outside if there are ender crystals, 
inside if not), strafing and firing ender 
charges, a direct charging attack, and 
perching. If attacked while perched, it will 
use a breath attack. The purple clouds that 
remain from this breath attack can be 
bottled as Dragon’s Breath. A great way to 
do damage to the Ender dragon is to 
destroy an ender crystal as it heals. It will 
take ¼ normal damage if attacked 
anywhere except its head. When defeated, 
the Ender dragon opens the exit portal and 
drops a dragon egg.
WITHER - HP: 300(x 150),  
600 (x300 - Pocket Edition),  
50 XP when killed  
Wither exist through creation from soul 
sand in a T shape and putting three wither 
skeleton skulls placed above them.  
It flashes blue and grows larger in size, 
rendering it invulnerable in this state.  
When it ends, it will cause a massive 
explosion that destroys blocks as well as 
inflicting damage. It will take most normal 
attacks but immune to fire and lava.  
When its health drops to half, it will activate 
an armour that makes it immune to 
arrows. It will fire wither skulls, inflicting a 
‘wither’ effect (draining health slowly).

them, and only tamed horses/
donkeys/mules are able to breed. 
Horses have a temper meter from  
0 to 100, which vary and thus the time 
to tame varies between them. They 
will drop leather when killed.
WOLF - WILD - HP: 8 (), 
Tamed: 20 HP (x10) - Attack: 
Wild 3 HP (Easy), 4 HP 
(Normal), 6 HP (Hard), Tamed 4 HP, 
1-3 XP when killed, 1-7 XP when bred 
Wolves start out as neutral mobs, 
meaning they won’t attack unless 
provoked. Wild wolves will have a 
drooping tail and will hunt rabbits, 
skeletons, and sheep without any 
provocation. Hostile wolves are easily 
distinguishable by their red eyes. Tame 
a wolf with a bone and it will sport a 
red collar line and will follow the player 
up to 10 blocks away. Use meat to 
encourage breeding. Pups start out 
with 8 HP but graduate to 20 HP upon 
growing into an adult. Wolves will 
inexplicably run away from llamas. 
OCELOT - 10 HP (), Attack:  
2 HP on chickens only,  
1-3 XP when killed, 1-7 XP when bred  
Ocelots are passive mobs unless 
there’s a chicken in the vicinity, which 
it will hunt even when separated by 
fences. Taming and breeding ocelots 
can be done with any raw uncooked 
fish or salmon. Though ocelots come 
in distinctive patterns, newly bred 
kittens take on more domestic 
schemes: tuxedo, tabby, and Siamese.
LLAMA - HP: 15 to 30 (x 15), 
Attack: 1 HP, 1-3 XP when 
killed, 1-7 XP when bred 
Llamas are incredibly useful neutral 
mobs as they can be used to transport 
items around. Llamas spawn in 
savannah and hill biomes. Llamas are 
tamed in similar fashion to horses. 
Simply ‘activate’ them repeatedly until 
hearts appear on the user interface. 
Though you can ride llamas, you won’t 
be able to control them. Use a lead on 
them and a caravan will form. Equip 
llamas with chests for transportation.

It can get pretty dangerous out 
there in the world of Minecraft. As 
you embark on your ideas and try 
to build your world, you’re likely to 
run into one or more of the 
game’s many mobs. (See our 
guide to mobs on Page 26.) In 
addition to whatever resources 
you’re farming to maybe build 
yourself a house or a village, 
you’re going to be crafting some 
weapons and armour, especially if 
you plan on doing some heavy 
exploration.

SWORD
Melee weapon that will inflict damage in one sweeping motion. The stronger the 
resource, the longer lasting the sword is with more attack power. Sometimes 
certain mobs will drop swords upon defeat, like zombies and zombie pigmen. 
Swords can be traded with smithing villagers for emeralds: 
1 Enchanted Iron Sword = 9-10 Emeralds, 2nd Tier Trade
1 Enchanted Diamond Sword = 12-15 Emeralds, 3rd Tier Trade
Swords are typically crafted with a wooden stick and an iron ingot, gold ingot, 
cobblestone, or a diamond:

BREEDING
 & FARMING
In addition to exploration, 
combat, and overall survival, 
Minecraft allows players to breed 
animals for additional resources 
(like meat!), as well as farm 
resources like wheat and 
pumpkins, which can be used to 
create more complex and fulfilling 
recipes. While farming and 
breeding can be a game in and of 
itself, adding to the endless 
possibilities of Minecraft fun, they 
can also be essential techniques 
that ensure you’re good to go on 
foods to satisfy your hunger 
meter. This section will help you 
understand the fundamentals and 
become a master of farming.

COMPANION

BREEDING
Breeding is the process of two adult 
animals of the same species creating 
baby animals, growing them into 
adults, and spawning more babies, 
thus adding to the great circle of 
Minecraft life.
In order to really ensure successful 
breeding, first you’ll want to build a fence 
of any kind, your standard wooden fence 
will do. You can determine your size, 
though animals tend to like having 
space to move around. Make sure it’s 
entirely squared off. You can build a 
swing door if you need to enter.
Lure two adult animals into the 
enclosed area and give each of them 
their respective bait (see the bait chart). 
They will enter into “Love Mode” and a 
baby animal will spawn.
Now, while chickens can be bred  
with seeds (see the bait chart and the 
farming section), there is another method 
that’s perhaps truer to nature. You’ll also 
want to try to collect about 32 eggs.
Chickens are a common mob 

C O M P A N I O N
BREEDING

throughout the main world of 
Minecraft, so while this may require 
some time, it is doable.
You’ll want to build another fence as 
well. Make sure there is plenty of 
space. Equip your eggs and toss them 
within the enclosed area. One in every 
4 eggs thrown has a chance to spawn 
a baby chicken.  One in every 32 has a 
chance of spawning 4 baby chickens. 
They will grow into adults, which is 
about a 20-minute wait, and they 
themselves will lay eggs. Collect 
those, and repeat the process until 
you get the amount of chickens and 
eggs you need. Baby animals will 
follow their parents around until they 
become adult. Breeding will reward 
the player with some experience. 
For more details on that as well as the 
items mobs drop under different 
circumstances, see our guide 
on page 26.

FARMING
CROP FARMING
Farming begins with seeds. Seeds are a 
basic fundamental for crop farming in 
Minecraft that allows the player to grow 
many types of food. The most basic 
type of seed is simply “seed” found by 
mining tall grass, which can then be 
farmed into wheat which, in turn, can be 
farmed into bread.
There are four seed types:
Seed  Pumpkin Seed   
Melon Seed  Beetroot Seed
Other crops that can be farmed:
Potato  Carrot   Sugar   Cane
In the more modern gaming-related 
vernacular, resources, mobs, and other 
items can be “farmed”, as in repeating 
certain actions to obtain multiples of 
one item, though this will focus on 
traditional crop farming and harvest.
Certain food items, namely the 
potato and the carrot, act as their 
own seed and with proper technique 
can be farmed into a larger harvest.
Your most important tool for farming 
will be a hoe, which can be constructed 
from wooden sticks and any craftable 
resource (iron ingots, diamond, etc.).
Farming in Minecraft 
can be a pretty 
essential activity if you 
want to make a number 
of recipes, but it can 
also be a pretty serene 
activity, too!

COMPANION
49
48
Next you’ll want to find some grass 
or dirt, preferably near a water 
source, and use the hoe until the 
block changes to farmland. Bear in 
mind that farming is not solely 
relegated to the terrain.
For example, you can build a sky 
high tower but as long as there is dirt, 
some water (you’ll need a bucket), 
and light, you should be good to go. 
Water can be placed on the same level 
as the dirt or a block below and 
farmland must be within 4 blocks of 
the water. You’ll know you did it right 
when the farmland becomes darker.
WHEAT, CARROTS, AND POTATOES ALL EXHIBIT CERTAIN GROWTH 
STAGES. WHILE BEETROOTS, POTATOES, AND CARROTS HAVE 4 
STAGES OF GROWTH, WHEAT HAS 8:
Once you see the wheat with a brown tip, it has matured and is 
ready for harvesting. Use any tool to collect your wheat. More 
seeds may drop.
Growth time varies depending on certain conditions met in 
regards to water and lighting, but typically a full day/night cycle. 
A tip is to use bone meal to advance a stage of growth.
Like any actual farming, care should be taken to preserve and 
grow crops to their fullest potential. Walking over crops will ruin 
them, for example, and even other creatures can ruin your crops 
by walking over them, so take care to protect them! Water will 
freeze in cold biomes but can be countered by using certain 
blocks like carpets or slabs.

Minecraft has gone through a massive 
evolution since its inception, and not 
just on PC, either. Over time, what 
started as a simple “cave game” by 
creator Markus “Notch” Persson on a 
private test server quickly grew into a 
phenomenon has been ported to many 
platforms, including mobile devices –
each offering something unique in the 
process while continuously getting 
support from both developers and the 
community. Let’s take a look at the 
many versions of Minecraft that have 
been made available over the years.

THE MANY 
VERSIONS 
OF MINECRAFT
The PC (Windows) version is the earliest and 
arguably most feature-complete version of 
Minecraft to date. Over time, features like 
Survival mode and the Nether that we know 
today were added, all before its official release 
at MineCon in 2011. 
Over the years, Minecraft has also seen 
release on Mac and Linux operating 
systems. While the PC version of 
Minecraft was written in the Java 
programming language, the Windows 
10 version was written in C++ and is, 
for all intents and purposes, based on 
Minecraft: Pocket Edition. 
The Java version allows for unofficial mods by 
adding or replacing class files to the main 
minecraft.jar code, a method not officially 
supported by developer Mojang. Players can, 
however, officially change textures and sounds 
around via the game’s resource API packs in the 
POCKET EDITION
Minecraft: Pocket Edition is the first 
port of Minecraft, designed to take 
advantage of a plethora of mobile 
operating systems. The initial release 
was exclusive to Sony’s Xperia Play 
smartphone in 2011. Since then, it 
has been ported to the following 
operating platforms:

settings menu. Players can also customise skins 
as either JPG or PNG files. While there are many 
third-party programs that can be used 
alongside Minecraft, Mojang does not officially 
support them.
Players are also able to take advantage of a 
number of options regarding hosting connected 
servers. There is the default Mojang server, 
provided free of charge on PC, Mac, and Linux. 
There is also local area network (LAN) support 
for people connected to a specific network. 
Players can use external rental services or 
Realms, the official server subscription service 
from Mojang.
Players receive the Windows 10 version for free 
if they own the original Java version.
Android - iOS - Windows Phone - FireOS - FireTV - 
Samsung Gear VR  - Apple TV
Like the Windows 10 version, Minecraft: Pocket 
Edition is developed using C++.  This edition 
features certain exclusive add-ons and 
achievements. Some of these include resource 
packs that let you change how the game looks 
(City Texture Pack and Cartoon Texture Pack, for 
example). There are also mash-up packs that 
include skins, like the Fallout mash-up pack. The 
most important Pocket Edition (and Console) 
exclusive feature is the Minecraft Marketplace that 
allows players to purchase these skins (with 
themes like Holiday, Minecon 2016, Power 
Rangers, etc.) and texture packs created by the 
community. Other exclusive features include 
sounds for jumping on blocks as well as new 
splash text phrases on the main menu.

THE MANY VERSIONS OF MINECRAFT
C O M P A N I O N
If you own the Xbox 360 or 
PlayStation 3 versions, the 
price of the game on their 
respective successors is 
around $20. Multiplayer 
requires a subscription to 
Xbox Live Gold or 
PlayStation Plus services. It 
is assumed that the same 
will follow for Nintendo 
Switch Online, Nintendo’s 
upcoming paid service.
This version of the game 
plays similarly to the PC 
version but there are many 
exclusive features and 
items. For example, split-
screen functionality is 
available for up to four 
players provided the 
hardware is connected to 
HDMI or VGA. The 
PlayStation Vita version, 
however, only supports 
multi-player online and via 
ad hoc mode. 
The crafting system is more 
simplified for the use of 
controllers, but there is an 
option to use the PC system 
as well. For newcomers, a 
tutorial mode is included in 
order to understand the 
Survival mode’s mechanics 
such as crafting, cooking, 
and the day night cycle. 
One of the largest 
differences from the PC 
version is that while the PC 
version is capable of 
spawning worlds near 30 
million blocks in size (earlier 
versions used to spawn 
infinitely), the largest on 
console is 5120x5120 in the 
PlayStation 4 version. The 
latest Console Edition on 
the Nintendo Switch sports 
up to 3072x3072 map sizes.
The Console Edition also 
includes a massive number 
of texture packs and skins, 
some exclusive to certain 
gaming platforms. There is 
no modding in this version 
of Minecraft, and thus these 
add-ons can be purchased 
on the hardware’s 
respective digital store.
CONSOLE EDITION
Minecraft: Console Edition was developed by Scottish 
developer 4J Studios (who ported Banjo-Kazooie and 
Perfect Dark to Xbox Live Arcade) alongside Mojang, 
though 4J currently handles all the updates and 
maintenance. This edition of Minecraft appears on the 
following gaming platforms:
Xbox 360 - Xbox One - PlayStation 3 - PlayStation 4 - 
PlayStation Vita - Wii U - Nintendo Switch

The Pi Edition is a version of Minecraft based on an 
early version of the Pocket Edition that is designed to 
serve as an educational tool for novice programmers. 
It is still available to download, but is no longer 
updated. This version is slightly stripped down 
compared to other versions of the game, as there are 
no mobs and there is no crafting or smelting. While 
other editions feature the Survival mode, Pi Edition 
only features the Creation mode.
The newest edition of Minecraft, released in 2016, is 
the Education Edition released on Mac and 
Windows 10 operating systems. This edition is 
based on the Pocket Edition, designed to encourage 
students to build projects and learn cooperation. 
Up to 30 students can play 
in a single classroom with 
no server setup required. 
Teachers are able to create 
an NPC to act as a guide 
or instructor, even 
designating where 
students can and cannot 
build and using an in-
game chalkboard as a 
teaching tool.
Teachers can also 
upload or download 
lesson plans that vary 
between age groups 
and tackle various 
subjects like history.

MOD & BUILD
Minecraft is incredibly addictive in standard 
Survival Mode, but it can lose a bit of its lustre 
once players feel as if they’ve seen and done 
everything the game has to offer. Still, the game 
continues to be popular year after year, but 
why? Because people have been able to expand 
their creative capabilities through modding, 
and, in turn, share their creations with the 
world. It’s hard work to build something that 
people will enjoy, but the feeling of reward 
that’s achieved after everything is said and 
done makes it all worthwhile.

Many people are intimidated by the process of 
altering their PC games, but mod installation is 
so simple that everyone can do it! The most 
difficult part of the process is deciding what to 
download, because the amount of content 
floating around out there is gargantuan. A 
Google search will pull up a nearly endless list 
of results, but how do you sift through the 
mediocre stuff and find those diamonds in the 
rough? Well, by reading the following pages! 
We’ll arm you with useful console commands 
and suggest basic tools like Forge. Once you’re 
off and running with that, there are graphical 
overhauls to consider, as well as massive mods 
and fan-made creations which are both original 
and based on pop culture. With all this, you 
should have enough content to keep yourself 
busy for months… until the next Minecraft 
Explorer comes out, of course!

PIxELMON
MINECRAFT MODS 1
What’s It About?
This mod has had a decent following since its initial release, but 
it’s become much more popular since the rise of Pokémon Go. 
It’s been heavily discussed in Minecraft communities, and 
popular Youtubers have uploaded gameplay aplenty. It isn’t hard 
to see why, even though Pokémon has been adapted into video 
games a multitude of times. Games based on this franchise have 
mostly utilised a top-down view, not unlike traditional Zelda 
titles. Having Pokémon served up in an RPG flavour brought 
countless hours of fun to the masses, but never really made its 
audience feel as if the in-game world had been their oyster, ripe 
for the picking. Pixelmon, on the other hand, delivers precisely 
that. It allows you to explore a variety of biomes in first-person, 
and in typical Minecraft fashion, you’re still able to build and 
craft to your heart’s content.
Pokémon 
in Block Form!
One of the more notable 
mods to gain traction over the 
last few years has been Pixelmon. 
Having celebrated its fifth 
anniversary this year, it shows no 
signs of stopping as new 
Pokémon are still being 
added on a semi-regular 
basis.

Survive While You Catch ‘Em All!
In Survival Mode, you’re placed in the shoes of a Pokémon 
trainer, scavenging for materials required to make Poké Balls, 
PC’s (used for managing captured Pokémon), and healing 
machines. As soon as you’re fully equipped, you’re free to find 
these creatures in the wild, catch them, and even use them in 
battle. It doesn’t end there, though. If you want to take down the 
strongest Pokémon, you’ll have to work on evolving your own 
with elemental stones. Outside of this, there are no rules or 
limitations. How you go about your business is completely up to 
you, and isn’t that what being a Pokémon trainer is all about?

Get a Collection 
of Pokemon at Your Leisure!
If you’re not in the mood for a grind, 
Pixelmon is also fun in Creative Mode, 
where you’ll be equipped with an infinite 
supply of everything. You’ll be able to 
catch whatever you want, whenever you 
want. Just break the law of gravity (click 
your spacebar twice) and free roam the 
world’s diverse biomes from the sky. 
You’ll rack up an impressive list of 
captured Pokémon in mere hours!
Need More for 
Your Minecraft 
Pokémon Fix?
If you want a more epic experience, 
look up Pokémon Cobalt and 
Amethyst. It’s an entirely new 
adventure which takes place in a 
never-before-seen region, featuring 
136 new Pokémon and an original 
story where you’re tasked with 
preventing the antagonist from 
releasing a Legendary darkness. The 
developers worked tirelessly on this 
for nearly 3 years, and their efforts 
have culminated into a game which 
takes over 60 hours to complete. If 
you’ve played most of the mainstream 
Pokémon RPG’s out there, then this is 
the mod for you!
Overall
Fans of the franchise 
should find this to be a 
refreshing change of pace from 
vanilla Minecraft gameplay. 
Experienced gamers will likely gravitate 
towards Survival mode, but there’s 
nothing wrong with just wanting to chill 
and “catch ’em all”, especially if you don’t 
have the patience to gather materials 
and craft. So regardless of how you 
normally play Minecraft, Pixelmon 
is the perfect addition to your 
mod library.

What 
You’ll Find
There’s a wide variety of 
villages, as you’ll come across 
humble farm lands, military 
garrisons, and religious 
communities. These settlements 
can also be quite large, 
certainly dwarfing those 
you’ll find during vanilla 
gameplay. 
MINECRAFT MODS 2
Want Something Fresh?
One of the things that make 
Minecraft so great is its ability 
to whisk you off to a different 
land. A land made of blocks, 
granted, but that’s the point, 
isn’t it? What’s the point of 
living a second life if you’re 
going to be spoon fed an 
emulated reality? No, you want 
to experience something new 
and unique, something you’d 
never be able to experience in a 
lifetime... and that’s precisely 
where Millénaire comes in.
Experience  
a Lively World 
Based on Ancient Culture!
After a while, Minecraft’s world – as 
spellbinding as it can be – can seem rather 
desolate. After all, there’s nobody to 
interact with unless you come across a 
village, but they’re few and far between. 
Millénaire, a single-player mod, aims to make 
the Overworld much livelier by filling space 
with randomly generated NPC 
villages, loosely inspired by 11th-
century Japanese, Indian, 
Norman, and Mayan cultures. 
Be Cautious  
in Your Travels!
It isn’t all glitz and glamour 
though, as you’ll also encounter 
hostile bandits and soldiers in 
your travels, so be wary. 
Villagers can also be pushed to 
war, and depending on the role 
you decide to play, this can 
either be dangerous or pure 
entertainment.

Overall
Minecraft provides 
countless hours of addictive 
fun, but there comes a point 
when players think they’ve seen and 
done just about everything. Millénaire, 
however, expands upon the vanilla 
experience and really makes your 
unique, randomly generated world 
come to life. Don’t feel comfortable 
modding your game? No worries, 
as Millénaire comes with its 
own installer!
Looking for More 
Historical Mods?
If you want a historical mod 
which provides a bit more 
challenge and adventure, you’ll 
want to visit Atum, a desert 
dimension full of sand, temples, 
and plenty of new foes. The 
going won’t be easy, so bring 
your best armour, weapons, 
food, and plenty of torches 
before you embark! You’ll begin 
your journey by constructing a 
Portal, your key being a 
Jewelled Scarab as an 
offering to the gods. 
Once inside you’ll trudge 
through the sands and 
explore dungeons, all the 
while protecting yourself 
from mummies, wraiths, 
pharaohs, and more! It 
may not be historically 
accurate, but it’s top-
notch entertainment 
that Minecraft fans 
shouldn’t miss!
Your Actions Matter!
These villages aren’t just gratuitous 
decoration; once you’re inside you’ll 
have plenty to do. Listen to villagers 
talk about their job, life, or even the 
weather. Peruse their wares to figure 
out what makes each economy 
thrive, and you’ll be armed with 
enough knowledge to take full 
advantage and really make it boom. 
By trading items lacking in each 
location, villagers will go from 
merely getting by to being 
prosperous, and you’ll see villages 
physically grow as a result. Your 
reputation amongst the locals is 
also important, and by completing 
quests you’ll increase your renown 
and acquire useful items. Improve 
your standing enough and you’ll be 
invited to construct a permanent 
residence, and by continually 
helping people out you’ll become a 
lord, complete with NPC’s which will 
do your bidding, even if your request 
is nefarious in nature.

THE AETHER
A New Dimension Awaits!
People get lost in Minecraft for hours at a time 
because it keeps them focused, but is also 
relaxing. Hostile mobs may crank the intensity 
up at times, but the experience is more about 
managing your time and resources, as well as 
getting creative with whatever you decide to 
build. But have you ever wanted something more 
substantial? A trip through the Overworld where 
danger lurks around every turn, and you’re 
rewarded for charging in its direction head first? 
If so, forget the Overworld and visit a new 
dimension: The Aether.
The Sequel
This mod ceased development some years ago, but 
the dimension lives on in The Aether II: Genesis of the 
Void. Acting as a complete redo of the original, it 
includes new textures, mobs, blocks, and structures. 
It comes with an installer, so you don’t have to 
worry about keeping up with the latest builds,  The 
Aether II will auto-update as needed.

Danger and Beauty at Every Turn!
At first, you’ll be amazed by the environment and large flying 
whales – not to mention how the environment is beautifully 
coupled with custom music – but it won’t take long for you to 
come across entirely new mob types, many of which are 
hostile. They’ll try to push you off the map, drown you, 
catapult you against a mountain at dizzying speed, and poison 
you. Talk about survival! Furthermore, if you like finding loot 
there’s randomly generated dungeons of varying difficulty. Of 
course, they’re also  guarded by bosses. After all, what’s a 
dungeon without a boss?
Overall
The sequel is the way 
which most should go. It 
improves upon nearly every 
area where the original was 
lacking, and more importantly, is 
still supported by its developers. 
Keep in mind that you’re going to 
need a respectable PC to run this 
mod efficiently, but otherwise, 
this is an adventure that 
you shouldn’t  miss.
Can’t Get Enough RPGs in Your Life?
If you enjoyed Aether for its RPG-like qualities, you may want to 
try the DivineRPG mod. It’s loaded with 115 new mobs and 
bosses, hundreds of new blocks and items, as well as its own 
unique weapons and armour. What really makes this one of the 
most ambitious and extensive Minecraft mods, however, is that 
it also includes 8 new dimensions! Relax in beautiful Eden, 
watch Skythern collapse upon itself, try to survive in Iceika’s 
frozen wastelands, or lose your mind in Vethea, the realm of 
nightmares. We’d go on, but if you’re not downloading 
DivineRPG by now, you should make it a priority!
The Aether is made up of large floating 
islands and Aerclouds (solid, cloud-like 
blocks), and regardless of what you’ve 
collected in the Overworld, you’re going 
to have to start from scratch.  
  The materials you’ll find in this mod,  
 including skyroot logs, are extremely  
 resistant against the tools you’re used to. 
Also, because oxygen levels are so low 
in this deceptive paradise in the sky, 
torches and fire won’t be able to aid 
you. It’s a harsh environment, but the 
name of the game is adaptability. 
Navigating the floating islands may 
prove tricky, but there are creatures 
reminiscent of Final Fantasy’s Chocobos, 
which can be tamed and trained for 
companionship and travelling. 
Adapting is Key to Your Survival!

JURASSICRAFT
MINECRAFT MODS 4
What have they got  
in there, King Kong?
It’s probably safe to assume that 
most people are fascinated by 
dinosaurs. So, when Steven 
Spielberg unleashed Jurassic Park 
upon the world in 1993, people 
opened their wallets, stared 
Universal Studios dead in the face 
and said, “Take my money, please!” 
Ever since, fans have buzzed, “What 
if there was a real Jurassic Park?” 
Don’t laugh, because it could 
happen! Scientists have practised 
gene switching on chickens, causing 
tails to grow and teeth to form in 
their beaks. Still, people might be 
hesitant to travel to a park where 
they could become T-Rex dental 
floss, but thanks to JurassiCraft, you 
can visit a land of dinosaurs from 
the safety and comfort of your chair!
Spared No Expense
JurassiCraft is a pretty extensive mod. Dinosaurs are 
obviously the main focus, and between the Brachiosaurus, 
Dilophosaurus, Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus, Triceratops, 
Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor, and more on the way, 
there’s a healthy selection of them. If you’re determined to 
make your own replica of Jurassic Park, there’s a number of 
themed decorations included to help give your project a 
legitimised look, including a collection of prehistoric plants 
available for authenticity’s sake!

Welcome… 
to JurassiCraft
While JurassiCraft draws 
much of its inspiration from 
Jurassic Park, it isn’t meant to be an 
exact replica. No, this mod isn’t 
limited to this particular franchise, so 
you’ll stumble upon a variety of other 
things in your travels. That said, if 
you wanted to recreate particular 
items or sets from the film, 
the tools are there for 
you to do so. 
Life Finds a Way: 
The best part of this mod, 
without question, is the ability 
to create dinosaurs. First you’ll 
need to find fossils so you can 
extract some dino DNA. Of course, if you 
want to do anything with that DNA, you’ll need to 
build some lab equipment. You should be there when 
dinosaurs hatch out of their eggs, too. This process is called 
imprinting and will help make the dinosaur tame. Some 
tamed/imprinted dinosaurs will defend you if you’re attacked, 
while others won’t. Don’t froth at the mouth at the idea of 
having a pet T-Rex though, because that’s one of the non-
imprintable creatures. Last but certainly not least, if you’re 
not looking to get slaughtered by your own creations every 5 
minutes, building enclosures is a must. Each species of 
dinosaur has their own behavioural traits, however, so try not 
to mix dinosaurs that won’t play nice together. If you’re a dino 
geek or just love the Jurassic Park franchise, this mod will 
tickle your fossilised funny bone!
TOO MUCH WORK?
 If you’d rather just enjoy the 
Jurassic Park experience 
without having to build your 
own park, there’s a couple of 
maps you can download. 
InternationalGenetic - a High 
Grandmaster Architect on 
Planetminecraft.com - has 
made an impressive rendition 
of Isla Nublar, measuring 8 km 
long and 2 km wide. It’s the 
perfect companion map, as 
the developer actually 
recommends combining this 
with JurassiCraft. Unless you 
have butterfingers like Dennis 
Nedry, it’ll be a breeze to 
install and you’ll be running 
from dinosaurs in no time!

Part of Minecraft’s fun is never knowing what you’ll find in

extra fun with the game, and that is when console 
commands come in handy. This is a feature available in the 
PC and Minecraft: Pocket Edition.
CONSOLE 
COMMANDS

64
65
Console commands allow players to tinker 
with the game outside of its normal 
challenges and design. You can summon 
items, change visual settings, game 
settings, and more to your heart’s content. 
Usually when a new world is created, the 
game will ask if you want cheats enabled. 
Simply choose ‘Yes’ and start your game. 
You’ll need to hit the ‘T’ key to bring up the 
command console. Make sure your 
command starts with a forward slash (‘/’), 
unless you are playing in multiplayer mode.
Certain commands will affect groups of players or entities through target selector 
variables. The variables include:
@p - Command targets nearest player.
@r - Command targets a random player.
@a - Command targets all players.
@e - Command targets all entities.
@s - Command targets the entity that executed the command.
An example: /gamemode creative @r

Creative mode. Instead, the 
player must enter the 
following command:
 
/give @p

The command block will work 
when the player makes use of 
redstone power (for example, 
placing a button). Once the 
command block is activated, 
an interface will appear for 
the player to assign it any 
command of their choosing.

MINECRAFT FORGE & MODS

FORGE
& MODS
Forge is an open-source 
application program interface 
(API) that allows for not just the 
creation of mods and their 
loading, but it does the legwork 
to ensure that the mod you 
want to use is compatible with 
the version of Minecraft you are 
using. Minecraft Forge also 
allows players to tweak and 
toggle mods on or off as they 
see fit. If you are new to 
Minecraft mods, understand 
that they are first and foremost 
modifications to your game 
that may have an effect on 
certain game files. Once you 
gain an understanding of what 
you’re getting into, take the 
most important step: be wary of 
what you download! Research 
carefully. For example, you can 
visit YouTube for specifics on 
certain mods. Search the 
Minecraft Forum 
(minecraftforum.net) for mods 
that have been tested and 
installed with success, or at least 
mods that are ensured not to 
come with any malicious 
software attached.
Mods can be a great way to enhance your Minecraft 
experience. As you’ll see in our section on Minecraft 
shaders, they can be used to give the game a massive 
visual overhaul as well as change the rules of the world or 
add items not included in the base game. How do I get 
started on getting to know mods, you ask? You’ll want to 
get to know Minecraft Forge first.

MOD & BUILD

1. 
INSTALL MINECRAFT 
Make sure you have Minecraft 
installed, of course! The latest version is 
recommended; however, you can use a 
legacy (older) version if you so choose. 
Run the game at least once so that Forge 
will install the files in the necessary places.
2. 
BACK UP YOUR GAME FILES
This is an important step: Make a 
backup of your game files. In case 
something goes wrong, you don’t want to

Make sure you have Forge 
installed.
SEARCH FOR MODS
Search for mods you’d like to 
use. As stated in our intro, 
please take great care when 
searching for mods and use 
trustworthy websites and 
forums. You don’t want to 
download the wrong thing 
and infect your entire 
system! If you’re new to this

MINECRAFT SHADERS
72
73
It’s also recommended you download 
and install the GLSL Shaders mod, 
which assists in the performance of 
certain shaders.
Shader options can be found under the 
“Super Secret Settings” option under 
regular options in the game’s menu. 
From there, certain shaders can be 
toggled through or disabled entirely.
Bear in mind that installing shader 
packs can be incredibly taxing on your 
hardware and even cause a drop in 
frames per second (FPS). Make sure 
your hardware supports OpenGL 2.1 
and you have a heck of a graphics card 
for some of these.
With that in mind, let’s look at some 
top-tier shaders!

SHADERS
A look at some amazing visual overhauls 
you can download for Minecraft!
SEUS does an 
amazing job 
improving on the 
use of light and 
shadow along with 
creating more 
realstic clouds.
One of the things that makes Minecraft 
unique is its look. Its fundamentally 
blocky look brings a certain appeal to 
its many players, inspired by the 
creativity gauged from actual building 
blocks and sets. Minecraft as it is offers 
near-endless experiences and extra 
features like cheats and mods only add 
to that. Did you know you can also give 
the game a facelift and improve on its 
lighting? That’s where “shader” packs 
come in!
Shaders allow for different visual 
perspectives, changing how your 
Minecraft world looks and injecting 
some potentially gorgeous life into 
the game.
Going about installing shaders is a 
relatively painless process:
1 
Grab Forge from files.
minecraftforge.net and run the .jar 
file. Select the ‘forge’ profile the next 
time you start up Minecraft.
2 
Head on over to optifine.net/
downloads and download the 
version you’re looking for. Just drop the 
.jar file in the ‘mods’ folder of your 
Minecraft folder. This is what grants 
you access to shaders and there are 
even some shaders pre-installed to 
check out.
3 
Finally, search for any shader 
packs (they will be closed in a .zip 
file) and drop them into the 
‘shaderpacks’ folder.

Minecraft player SonicEther created some 
unbelievably gorgeous lighting shaders to give 
an amazing vibrancy to the worlds of Minecraft. 
Plenty of soft lighting and sheen to go around. 
SEUS also adds some texture improvements 
such as better water rendering and reaction to a 
more natural light. Shadows are softer and more 
realistic. Transparent objects receive proper 
rendering, including stained-glass windows! This 
shader pack will definitely put your PC setup to 
the test. SonicEther recommends the fabulous 
Chroma Hills resource pack to give your world a 
colourful, fantasy feel, reminiscent of games 
like Fable and Trine.
A better look at the shader’s improved 
cloud rendering.
SEUS also improves subterranean areas as well, 
giving lava a warm glow while lighting the area.
Lighting is much more realistic here, reacting to the 
foliage and tree leaves blocking some of the rays.
 Realistic lighting and improved water rendering will give it 
a realistic sheen that makes you want to take a dip!

KUDA shaders aim for similar results as 
SEUS: an attempt at more natural, more 
realistic lighting. It adds shadows and a new 
lighting system, including godrays that peek 
through the clouds. It has undergone several 
modifications over time, improving on sky 
colours, fog colours, stronger sunlight, better 
bloom effects, improved water physics and 
more. KUDA is designed to be less 
demanding than SEUS, while also 
encouraging experimentation. It is one of the 
most gorgeous mods in Minecraft.

Continuum shaders are an extension of the 
SEUS shaders pack. This stunning add-on 
from the developers’ namesake uses 
rendering techniques similar to that of big-
budget “AAA” games, such as global 
illumination, volumetric rendering, and 
dynamic weather. Its official site suggests 
either an nVidia or AMD graphics card in the 
500 series. This shader aims for 
photorealistic lighting, dynamic sky 
colouring, and near-perfect shadow 
techniques. This is a workhorse of a mod.

The base Minecraft game already offers an 
extraordinary amount of unique worlds and items for 
players that allow them to play and create to their 
heart’s content. What if you wanted to add some 
flavour to your world? In the previous section, we 
talked about the types of visual mods (“shaders”) 
you can install to give your Minecraft game a 
beautiful visual upgrade, but there are plenty of 
other mods available to check out.
For more on installing mods for Minecraft, see our 
Forge section for an in-depth, step-by-step tutorial. 
Use your best judgment when installing mods and 
understand that some, if not all, mods are not 
officially supported by Mojang.
With that said, here are some mods we think can be 
pretty useful to your Minecraft adventure. Some are 
just plain cool, too!
USEFUL MODS
OPTIFINE
Minecraft doesn’t always run 
the way you want it to. We 
mentioned OptiFine in our 
section on shaders because it 
takes advantage of your rig so 
that Minecraft runs better.  
It supports high-definition 
textures so that you can run 
the shader of your choice. It 
comes with a number of 
graphical options as well. 
Alternatively, if your setup 
isn’t the greatest, Fastcraft will 
do what it can to get Minecraft 
running on lower-end 
hardware as well!

JUST ENOUGH ITEMS
Sometimes the Minecraft resource 
interface can be a major headache 
and you might not know right away 
what you need to craft an item. This 
mod saves you from having to open 
your browser and visit a wiki with a 
more refined interface, and lets you 
know an item’s recipe and the 
components you are missing to 
complete your new item.
APPLECORE
AppleCore makes a few tweaks to Minecraft’s 
hunger UI and food system. Holding Shift on a food 
item will give you its Hunger value, while holding food 
will let you know in the Hunger meter how much 
sustenance you’d receive from eating it. It’ll also tell 
you how you’re doing in terms of having actual food 
resources as well.
WAILA
(WHAT AM I LOOKING AT)
If you aren’t the biggest fan of surprises 
or playing guessing games, then this is 
the mod for you. WAILA will give you a 
ton of info on many items and mobs at 
a moment’s notice. If you wanted to 
know how long until an animal can 
breed again, if an animal has been 
tamed, how many armour points an 
entity has, the durability of a block, or 
enchantment descriptions, then this is 
absolutely the mod for you.

CARPENTER’S 
BLOCKS
Simply put, Carpenter’s 
Blocks adds slopes to give your 
Minecraft world a less static feel. 
It also allows a handful of items 
to be re-skinned with any other 
texture in the game.
PAM’S 
HARVESTCRAFT
If farming is your thing, 
you’ll get a kick out of 
Pam’s Harvestcraft mod. 
This add-on adds a 
plethora of new crops, 
garden bushes for harvest, 
trees, fish, and new cake 
blocks. You don’t have to 
just live off steak anymore! 
It also adds beekeeping to 
your Minecraft game 
including redstone 
items like buttons to 
collect honey or 
spawn bait. There is 
also a well for 
infinite water. On 
top of that, these 
new resources can, 
in fact, be traded 
for emeralds.
MULTI-HOTBAR

four times the item slots on the Minecraft 
hotbar from its original. Simply tap the grave

JOURNEYMAP
The worlds generated in Minecraft are massive, spanning millions 
and millions of blocks. While going in and seeing where the wind 
takes you can be fun and adventurous, sometimes you can get lost 
and feel overwhelmed. That’s where JourneyMap comes in. This 
mod will create a map for you as you explore each location. It allows 
you to leave checkpoints and marks, even letting you know when 
any mobs are trying to sneak up behind you!

ANIMAL BIKES
Animal Bikes is exactly what 
it sounds like: adds a ton of 
different animals (including 
a dragon!) for you to ride 
around on so you don’t have 
to go exploring so much on 
foot. And yes, you can ride 
that dragon and soar to  
the skies!
DECOCRAFT
Decocraft is more of an aesthetic mod than a utility 
one, but part of Minecraft’s appeal is to build a world 
as you imagine it. Sometimes that means wanting to 
build a home and decorate it! This particular mod set 
comes with a generous amount of decorative items 
that can be crafted and displayed proudly!

add some spice to the flora and fauna! Biomes 
O’Plenty adds an estimated 80 new biomes and 
12 sub-biomes. There are also new blocks and 
tools to play with.
PIG MANURE
Yes, you read that right: pig 
manure. You might think this is some 
sort of gag mod, but you’d be surprised 
what you can do with some manure in 
your hand! Manure is a great replacement 
for bone meal as a great accelerant for 
your crops. Basically you’re actually 
fertilising your crops! You can also heat 
the stuff to create bricks and, if you so 
choose, you can even dye wool 
brown. You might want to wash 
your hands after this one.

LEVELS
Levels is a 
mod that will 
make your 
weapons and armour a lot 
more effective. Rather than have weapons break 
over time, this mod will actually level up your 
weapons and make them even MORE durable. 
Over time your weapons will gain a special rare 
ability to really rain down chaos. Armour also 
increases in level over time, and you’ll actually 
get to see how strong a mob is.

Los Angeles,

The City of Angels is one of the most 
desirable tourist locations in the United 
States, mostly because they love the heavy

there’s no question that it’s one of the best 
spots to visit if you’re interested in film and 
television history, what can you do if you live 
far away and can't travel to the City of 
Angels? Well, you could follow 
Fujiwara1990’s example. Because Minecraft 
is the ultimate tool of expression, he 
was able to build an in-game city 
inspired by The Big Orange itself!

MOD & BUILD
Appreciate It for More 
Than Its Looks!
Exploring a massive city is one 
thing, but being able to live in a 
virtual world is another, and 
Fujiwara1990’s take on Los 
Angeles ensures you can do 
precisely that. Each building 
you’ll come across is freely 
accessible and partially 
furnished. Most structures also 
sport their own unique look, so 
you’ll eventually be able to find 
your way by recognising certain 
landmarks. There are plenty of 
small details outside which really 
add to the idea that this is a living, 
breathing city. The only thing 
that’s missing is actual traffic!
Not Exact, But Close Enough
Fujiwara1990 wasn’t concerned with making an exact replica of the 
city. Instead, his goal was merely to build something which captured 
its atmosphere. The end result, a massive landscape with plenty of 
long palm trees, high buildings and luxury homes, speaks for itself. 
What’s truly fascinating is that the project only took him weeks to 
finish. He accomplished this not by making everything from 
scratch, but by using building schematic files in MCEdit to raise 
them. The most difficult part was tree placement and mapping the 
road system, as he had to figure that out on his own.

Best Usage?
Having a pre-built city to stomp 
around in is fun, but Minecraft 
is used for so much more than 
surviving and building. 
Occasionally, friends get 
together in-game and roleplay. 
You could even do this on your 
own. Just think, wouldn’t it be 
interesting to pretend you’re 
the lone survivor in a post-
apocalyptic world?

MOD & BUILD
What’s Different?
Because the developer lives in Germany, he had to 
take certain liberties in transforming his vision into 
reality. Building placement and their makeup won’t 
remind you of any specific portion of the actual city, 
but in order to capture that California vibe, 
Fujiwara1990 added a bit more grass and trees than 
you’d see in real life. Also, unlike so many other fan 
creations, there’s no sense of ultra-realism on display. 
It was important to the developer that people could 
play his map in vanilla Minecraft, so no additional 
texture packs or mods are necessary.
WHAT OTHER LOS ANGELES  
CLONE CAN YOU EXPLORE?
Youtuber N11ck and friends have worked 
tirelessly on recreating the entire map 
from Grand Theft Auto V in a scale of 1:1. 
Their vision included not just the city, but 
the surrounding country and mountains 
as well. They currently sit at 40%, but 
unfortunately, N11ck has discontinued 
work on the project as it was too 
ambitious an undertaking.

ATROPOS
Atropos
Planetminecraft.com has been 
a great place for people to 
share their creations and get 
feedback, and once in a while, 
something so unique and 
impressive comes along, we’re 
left in awe at its artistry. 
Atropos is one such project, 
created by Carlos (Carloooo 
on the site’s forum), one of 
the forum’s High 
Grandmaster Architects.
What is it?
Atropos is a massive, mechanical 
turtle that’s been highly stylised with a 
steampunk vibe. It took Carlos about 5 
months to finish, and considering he 
was the only one working on it, it’s 
hard to imagine how he managed to 
get it done. Some people spend that 
much time just trying to build the 
perfect house, let alone something 
with such vision and scale.
88
89

MOD & BUILD
Reception
Atropos has been praised 
around the world, and what’s 
interesting is that nobody 
really cares why Carlos 
chose to design a turtle, 
because all that’s mattered 
is that Atropos is both 
gorgeous and mind-bending. 
Upon first glance, it’s rather 
innocent, almost like a 
children’s toy. But the more 
you stare at it, the more fine 
details begin to reveal 
themselves. Minecraft only 
allows its users to work with 
blocks of invariable size, yet 
somehow, Carlos managed 
to craft something that 
exhibits a cooperative 
duality between complexity 
and simplicity.
89

Overall
It undoubtedly draws parallels with 
the lost city of Atlantis, but there’s 
something far more majestic about a 
mobile turtle housing a civilisation on 
its back. Either way, the very essence 
of its design makes this one of the 
best fan creations of all time. It tickles 
the imagination, as it’s easy to get 
lost in thought over why this 
civilisation allowed a history of 
violence to repeat itself.
What Makes It Special
The design is ultimately what 
people are going to go gaga 
for, but Carlos cared enough 
about Atropos to provide it 
with some lore:

A long time ago there was an 
island in the middle of the sea
In it lived a people who were 
prosperous and free
One night a star fell
Sinking half the island into hell
The inhabitants decided to rebuild
Nevermore shall they be easily killed
They scoured the ruin of the island
Searching for something that 
would prevent their end
They stumbled upon the remains 
of the star
And found its ether had magic that 
would take them far
The magic that they combined 
with their technology
Gave them a new golden age in 
their history
For the power they had was shared
And the rule in the land was fair
But one day a ruler could not wait 
his turn
And forgot that magic ether burns
Now the whole island is in the 
deep
And the refugees now stuck in 
turtle ships

ADAMANTIS: 
CITY OF THE GODS
The City of Adamantis
Historical architecture piques the interest of 
many, and for a variety of reasons. Ancient 
civilisations didn’t have access to the tools 
and technology we have today, yet they were 
able to build large, majestic structures, often 
with distinctly unique features. A lot of these 
now famous landmarks were constructed 
from rock and stone, which is even more 
impressive. As a matter of fact, up until 
2014, archeologists were still debating how 
the ancient Egyptians were able to move 
pyramid blocks. Unfortunately, with the 
amount of time and resources it would take 
to erect something similar today – such as 
Rome’s Colisseum or Southern Jordan’s 
Petra – it’s no longer feasible to expect the 
birth of such wonders. Well, until Minecraft 
came along that is!

How Impressive Is It, Really?
The pictures are certainly impressive, but trust us, they don’t come close to 
conveying just how big this project really is. Jamdelaney1 – a High 
Grandmaster Architect on Planetminecraft.com – single-handedly built his 
‘City of the Gods’ in about 3 months, and by the time he finished, he had 
placed over 60 million blocks! This is hands down one of the most 
impressive city builds for Minecraft to date!
If Only It Were Real!
Adamantis is an enormous fantasy city built upon 
high cliffs from which natural springs and rivers flow, 
carried to the city by a network of aqueducts. The 
city is composed of tiers with the smallest buildings 
on the bottom, and bridges and walkways connect 
to upper levels with larger buildings until you reach 
an open temple complex that overlooks everything. 
This place will delightfully assault your sense of 
sight with its culmination of towering domes, 
colonnades, intricate fountains, and plazas that are 
beautifully contrasted with lush, green grass. While 
the core of the city was seemingly inspired by 
ancient Rome, the developer has masterfully 
inserted a number of other styles, providing 
Adamantis a unique flavour all its own. 
ANY OTHER MAPS YOU’D ENJOY?
While Adamantis has a timeless look 
about it, there’s another city which history 
buffs have been talking about for eons: 
Atlantis. Nobody really knows if this city 
had ever existed, so artists have a long 
history of conjuring the most fantastical 
imagery possible. This has led many to 
believe that Atlantis was incredibly 
advanced, almost alien. If that’s something 
you’d like to see, NinamanOfficial has 
delivered a beautiful rendition on 
Planetminecraft.com. It’s not quite as 
massive as Adamantis, but it’s well 
designed and fun to explore!

WESTEROSCRAFT
Have you ever watched a show or movie and 
wished you could transport yourself to the 
world depicted on screen? If so, you may 
want to rethink that. Take Game of Thrones, 
for example. While each location is 
absolutely gorgeous, with all the tragedy 
that befalls the lands and characters of 
Westeros, your excursion would likely end, 
shall we say, unexpectedly. But what if you 
could visit many of your favourite spots 
without having to suffer from such severe 
repercussions? Thanks to the effort of 
hundreds of people pooling their resources 
in Minecraft, now you can.
Westeroscraft – celebrating its 5th anniversary 
in 2017 – is a project with over 100 builders 
dedicated to recreating the entire continent of 
Westeros. The scope of such an undertaking is 
unfathomable, yet they’ve already completed 
key areas from the North, Iron Island, the Vale, 
Riverlands, Westerlands, the Reach, Stormlands, 
Dorne, and the Crownlands. That’s mighty 
impressive, considering how long it takes to 
replicate an average-sized building in the game.

MOD & BUILD
Simple locations, such as the Tower of Joy, only 
took a day or so to complete, while others took 
months. One of the largest builds had been the 
recreation of King’s Landing. Originally slated to 
be finished in 2 months, it actually took closer to 
half a year. All of the houses contained within 
were built and finished by hand, complete with 
decorated interiors, and there’s an estimate of 
around 4,000 structures in all.  
The community went bananas when they saw 
how large and detailed the city was, and 
rightfully so. King’s Landing was subsequently 
rebuilt with better textures and planning, but 
because enough people still enjoy the old 
version, Westeroscraft moderators have opted 
to keep it on the server for prosperity.
The level of dedication on display is practically 
unheard of. That said, Minecraft will thrive for years, if 
not decades, so it’s not like everyone’s hard work will 
be forgotten anytime soon. Anyone who lent a hand in 
this project’s development will be able to look back 
and take satisfaction in knowing they were part of one 
of the most insane build projects of all time.
While Minecraft’s version of Westeros 
is undoubtedly safer than what’s been 
depicted by George RR Martin and 
HBO, bring some dragonglass when

ground up, especially when dealing with such massive scale. 
I have a feeling that if we knew how many blocks have been 
used thus far, our eyes would pop out of our skulls as if we 
were in a Tom and Jerry cartoon.

LOCATIONS
Minecraft Middle-Earth features the regions of 
Eriador, Lindon, the Misty Mountains, Gondor, 
Rohan, Mordor, Rhovanion, and Harad. 
Completion overall currently rests at 38%, but 
while that doesn’t sound like much, some of 
these locations have obviously required a bit of 
time. In fact, I’d wager their recreation of Minas 
Tirith took more man hours than many of us have 
spent in Minecraft our entire lives. Just look at it!

BUT WHAT ABOUT 
MORDOR?
If you’re disappointed that 
Westeroscraft has yet to tackle 
Mordor, fret not, as there are other 
options available. The Lord of the 
Rings Minecraft Mod has made an 
impressive version of the most 
dangerous place in Middle-
Earth, but is not yet 
complete.
WHO IS THIS FOR?
Some people recreate notable bits of pop culture 
so they can set up a role-play server, but that’s 
not what Minecraft Middle-Earth is all about. This 
is purely a ‘build and enjoy’ experience, but for 
most, that should be fine. Standing in the shadow 
of the tower of Isengard will instill a powerful 
sensation of awe, and having the ability to visit 
Bag End without taking a trip to New Zealand is 
just as enticing.
If you’re not sure where you should begin poking 
around, tours are offered, and for the optimal 
experience, use Teamspeak to hear your guide 
mention interesting tidbits about each location. If 
you want to try your hand at building something 
they haven’t got around to, don’t worry, nobody’s 
going to scream, “You shall not pass!” The server 
hosts organised events which are open to anyone 
that want to help out. If food and refreshments are 
allowed, here’s hoping they have more than pitifully 
sized portions of Lembas bread!

TO BOLDLY GO…
Minecraft, the final frontier. These are the 
voyages of a gamer known as Zinnsee. His 
continuing mission was to explore strange new 
biomes, to seek out new life and new 
civilisations, to boldly go where millions have 
gone before… albeit with a twist. Armed with 
the knowledge that he could build anything in 
block form, this player set out to create the 
USS Enterprise NCC 1701-D – the ship helmed 
by Captain Picard and his crew in Star Trek: The 
Next Generation – at a scale of 1:6. 
CONSTRUCTING WHILE 
SURVIVING
 The final product is a thing of beauty, 
but the story of how it was built is even 
more interesting. Zinnsee constructed 
the Enterprise in Survival Mode, 
meaning he had to manage hunger, 
deal with hostile mobs, and craft all the 
necessary materials from scratch. Last 
but not least, he built this thing over a 
snow biome, which isn’t the most 
efficient place to begin such a build.
THESE IMAGES ARE OF 
THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 
1701-D’S CONSTRUCTION 
IN VANILLA MINECRAFT. 
HE BEGAN BY MAKING 
A LARGE SCAFFOLD 
OF SORTS. IT REACHED 
HIGH UP IN THE SKY, 
AND THEN JUTTED OUT 
HORIZONTALLY ENOUGH 
TO TAKE THE ENTIRE 
WIDTH OF THE CRAFT 
INTO CONSIDERATION. 

MOD & BUILD
TEXTURED ADVENTURE
Minecraft’s visual aesthetic can 
be somewhat limiting, especially 
if you’re looking to make an exact 
replica of something. While the 
USS Enterprise was constructed 
as accurately as possible, it just 
didn’t look right, so Zinnsee 
decided to make his own texture 
pack. As you can see in the 
accompanying examples, his 
texture pack not only made the 
Enterprise look less Minecrafty, but 
very close to the real thing.

TO ILLUSTRATE THE CULMINATION OF HIS WORK, ZINNSEE’S 
RECREATION OF THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-D WAS 
PHOTOSHOPPED OVER THE ORIGINAL PAINTING BY ANDREW 
PROBERT AND RICK STERNBACH, WHICH STOOD OUT 
PROMINENTLY IN THE CAPTAIN’S READY ROOM. 
HERE, WE’RE ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  
ENTERPRISE IN THE NIGHT SKY, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ZINNSEE’S TEXTURE 
PACK HAD BEEN APPLIED. HOWEVER, THE MOST DRASTIC CHANGE OF 
ALL SEEMS TO BE FROM WITHIN THE SHIP’S WALLS. THE BRIDGE LOOKS 
PARTICULARLY UGLY IN VANILLA BUT NOW LOOKS THE PART, COMPLETE WITH 
ANIMATED SCREENS AND CLOCKS, WHICH SHOW THE CORRECT TIME AND 
STARDATE. THE LAST EXAMPLE IS OF TEN FORWARD, THE SHIP’S BAR AND 
RECREATIONAL HANGOUT. 

WHAT ELSE? 
The ship’s innards has all the 
key locations you’d expect, such 
as the holodeck, cargo bay, 
Jefferies Tubes, tractor beam 
control station, warp reactor, the 
observation lounge, 
and more.

BEAM
ME UP!
Once Zinnsee finished construction, he had to remove 
the scaffolding as to not break the immersion of his 
project. So, how does one get aboard this thing? By 
beaming up of course! Zinnsee used a Nether portal to 
make this possible, and there’s even a view of the tractor 
beam in use from the outside! There have been countless 
iterations of this particular ship made by Minecraft fans, 
but few have taken it to this level. If you're a Star Trek die-
hard, this is a creation that shouldn’t be missed!

Once in a great while a game comes along that we 
just can’t take our mind off of. It infests every 
fibre of our being. Obligations suddenly become 
chores, because all we want to do is jump back 
into that virtual world. Many of us have been 
there, because Minecraft is one of the most 
addictive games of all time! Thankfully, modern 
technology allows us to satisfy our craving to 
remain in that blocky world by not only reading 
articles, but also with stream shows, film, and 
audio right from our phones. And because 
various platforms on the internet have granted 
everyone the ability to share content, there’s 
more stuff out there catered to our specific 
interests than ever before. As awesome as that 
is, the sheer amount of material to sift through 
can be downright intimidating. Type ‘Minecraft’ 
into Google, and you’ll find more stuff than you 
could ever absorb in multiple lifetimes (over 32 
million links, to be exact). But Minecraft Explorer 
has you covered! In the following pages, we’ll 
introduce you to a variety of notable content 
creators which either specialise in Minecraft, or 
have done something notable with, or for the 
brand. No matter where you are, you’ll know where 
to tap into all the Minecraft goodness you want! 
Just don’t blame us when your overall productivity 
takes a nosedive!

f you only listen to music through the 
mainstream, there’s an entire world of 
nerdcore rap you’re missing out on! Take Dan 
Bull, for instance. He’s a talented and diversified 
British rapper, and has a catalog of tracks which 
have covered high profile figures, and digital rights. 
He’s also independently released some comedy 
albums, but gamers know him best for releasing 
raps about video games on Youtube each week. His 
ultimate goal is to write a song about every game 
ever. Obviously, that’ll never happen, but it’s been fun 
to see him try, especially as Minecraft fans. Dan has 
made three Minecraft-related songs to date, with 
over 50 million cumulative views! This caught the 
attention of Minecraft Explorer, so we’ve caught up 
with Dan to talk about the game a bit and what it’s 
like to be a successful rapper on the internet!
MINECRAFT EXPLORER: Hi Dan, how are you?
DAN BULL: I’m alright. I have a banana which I’m 
planning to eat at the end of this interview,  so I’m alright!
ME: What are you working on?
DB: Making plenty of songs and videos about 
games for YouTube as usual, and now I’m also 
working on being a good dad to my baby son 
George, who just turned one year old.
ME: What initially attracted you to Minecraft?
DB: I always preferred games where you could be 
creative and do what you want instead of just 
walking down a corridor killing everything you 
come across, so Minecraft seemed brilliant. My 
first awareness of the game was through YouTube 
and I remember seeing someone had built a huge 
model of the USS Enterprise from Star Trek. 
Straight away I thought “Wow, this is like having 
unlimited Lego bricks!”
ME: What’s your preferred platform 
for the game?
DB: I am mostly a PC gamer 
although I’ve also got Minecraft on 
my phone, and on the Xbox One.
ME: You’ve done a few Minecraft 
music videos at this point, a couple 
of which are character oriented 
(the Creeper and Enderman). 
What’s your favourite character/
mob in the game, hostile or 
otherwise?
DB: I think it’s the farm animals, all 
of them. It’s nice to interact with 
creatures that are not trying to blow 
you up or eat you.
ME: Which mode did you prefer to 
play in, Survival or Creative?
DB: I probably spent equal time in 
both. I have a private creative world 
where I just let my imagination go 
“I always 
preferred 
games where 
you could be
creative  
and do what 
you want.”

wild and build huge structures, and 
then a survival server which I share 
with a few friends. Each one is like 
its own game really.
ME: What’s your favourite biome to 
play in?
DB: Probably jungle as it’s so dense 
and mysterious, and you can always 
just chop it down if you want some 
space. Mountains are cool too.
ME: What kind of things did you 
build during your time with the 
game, and what were you most 
proud of?
DB: One of the most obsessive 
things I built was just a huge crater 
in the ground that I kept hollowing 
out and making bigger and bigger. It 
wasn’t pretty to look at whatsoever 
but it fulfilled the childhood fantasy 
of being able to dig a huge hole in 
your garden as deep as you could.
ME: Did you ever play with mods or 
fan-made maps? If so, what were 
your favourites? 
DB: I only used cosmetic mods such 
as high resolution textures and 
shaders. I think there is so much in 
the base game already that I had to 
learn and discover, there was no 
need for more.

ME: More often than not, you make one music 
video for a video game and move along. What’s 
compelled you to keep going back to the 
Minecraft well, and can we expect another 
Minecraft rap in the future?
DB: Well, a few factors – I’ve played Minecraft 
for a long time, as it’s not a game where you just 
“beat” it and move on to the next game.  
Also, Minecraft has been a huge niche for video 
content on YouTube, so I was always keen to be 
part of it and knew it would be worth putting 
time into.  
Finally, Minecraft is just a fun game and a fun 
world, whereas a lot of other games I play tend to 
be quite bleak, apocalyptic worlds. Minecraft is 
colourful and as a result I can make colourful 
music about it.
ME: Speaking of content, you’ve been making 
video game raps for a long time now. What’s your 
creative process like (do the lyrics come before 
the music, etc)?
DB: It always varies for different songs. It usually 
starts with a spark of an idea, whether that’s a 
single sentence, or a character who I think would 
be good to sing about, or if I find a bit of music that 
reminds me of something. Then i just build on top 
of it and switch things around until it’s complete. 
Building a song is kind of like building a structure in 
the game, come to think of it.
ME: Do you find it difficult to maintain a personal 
life with the time you spend on projects?
DB: Yes, I am a very obsessive type 
of person and when I get really into a 
project, everything else tends to be 
forgotten. It’s a blessing and a curse; 
it means I can put a lot of focus into 
something in particular, but it also 
means I end up surrounded by mess!
ME: Which of your raps would you 
recommend to new listeners, and 
which ones are you most proud of?
DB: Well, as this is a Minecraft-
themed interview, I’d recommend my 
creeper rap song, which you can find 
on my channel on YouTube. The 
video was made by the brilliant 
Element Animation.
ME: A lot of YouTube artists have 
spent a lot of their time battling 
copyright takedown notices. Is this 
something you deal with regularly, 
or do you find that game publishers 
tend to ignore your content for its 
promotional quality?
DB: I have been fighting for copyright 
reform for many years because it 
seems to cause more problems for 
creators than it solves. I have been 
lucky and not had too many notices 
but I have spent a lot of time helping 
worried and confused creators who 
have. It’s a real shambles.

PEOPLE

ME: How often do game publishers/
developers approach you to make rap 
videos, and what’s your take on the 
potential conflict of interest there?
DB: It happens fairly often and I have 
done a lot of sponsored videos on 
my channel. I think there isn’t much 
conflict of interest as I’m not 
claiming to review the game 
objectively, my songs are usually 
about the lore of the game world 
and the characters in it. A sponsored 
video and a non-sponsored video on 
my channel are pretty much the 
same content-wise.
ME: Before we wrap up, from the 
perspective of trying to become 
successful, YouTube and music 
have changed considerably over 
the years. What advice would you 
give to aspiring newcomers in the 
current climate of internet 
artistry?
DB: Not everybody is going to make 
it professionally, and there are 
actually a number of benefits to 
doing it as a hobby instead of a job. 
Have fun and enjoy the freedom of 
doing it as a hobby, and if it ever 
becomes something more, then 
good for you. But right now every 
video I make, I have to worry if it’s 
going to do well so that I can use the 
revenue to pay my bills! In a way, I 
miss the times where I could just 
make anything I felt like for fun and 
not worry.
ME: Dan, as fans of both Minecraft 
and your content, thank you for 
your time. We look forward to your 
upcoming projects!
DB: Thanks for taking the time to 
talk to me, and thanks to the readers 
for reading this!

an Stapleton, known online as SSundee, is 
an American YouTuber with an 
overwhelming yet infectious personality. 
His videos open with a joke from a ‘derped’ 
alter-ego he calls ‘Derp SSundee’. From that 
point on, he delivers a strong dose of happy 
pep and cracks himself up constantly, but 
many who stumble upon his channel aren’t 
sure what to make of this. Their initial 
skepticism comes from being unable to figure 
out if he’s being annoying to gain 
subscriptions from a younger audience, or if 
he’s really that happy a guy. Everyone 
inevitably concludes that he’s the 
real deal. He just has an undeniably 
genuine quality about him. 
SSundee’s Minecraft videos come 
in a variety of flavours. He and 
another gamer will get together 
and play various lucky block 
challenges, where they open up 
boxes which will provide either loot 
or mayhem. These and other

theme, such as Mario Kart, Friday 
the 13th, fidget spinners, basically 
whatever’s popular at the time. He 
often plays a game mode called 
Bed Wars, where Minecraft players 
must defend their beds at all costs 
(it’s a lot more fun than it sounds!). 
For the Pokémon fans out there, 
SSundee has also hosted 
Minecraft Pokémon tournaments 
using the Pixélmon mod. 
WHAT ELSE IS ON THE MENU?
Currently, his most popular series outside of 
Minecraft is for Pokémon Go, but he’s posted 
content for a lot of games over the years, 
such as Clash of Clans, Mortal Kombat X, 
Agar.io, ARK: Survival Evolved, The Sims 4, 
and more. Outside of traditional gaming, 
there’s a variety of additional content 
available. He’s played the Would You Rather 
game, has participated in real-life challenges 
such as beard waxing, trying not to laugh at 
funny online videos, and will occasionally 
answer fan questions.
Ultimately, SSundee is a lot 
of fun. His personality is 
bright and uplifting, so he’s 
perfect to watch when you need a 
pick-me-up. More importantly, his 
content is solid. He’s always playing 
on cool maps or mods and usually 
has an equally hilarious friend –  
YouTube’s Crainer – along to add to 
the hilarity. As a content creator, it 
was very smart of him to diversify 
his offerings. Between Minecraft and 
Pokémon Go, he’s covering a couple 
of very hot properties and has 
undoubtedly boosted his subscriber 
base as a result. With that kind of 
flexibility, he’ll be able to keep 
making videos until he’s good and 
ready to retire!

their propensity for high energy fun 
has allowed PopularMMOs to grow

players must survive until only one 
is left standing. The maps played 
during this game are usually based 
on something from pop culture, 
such as Life Is Strange, Pokémon, 
The Simpsons, Minions, Super 
Mario, and that’s only the tip of 
the iceberg. Mini-games are 
another fun way they pass the 
time. There’s various takes on 
wave-based attacking or 
defending, avoiding certain mobs 
or items in hectic scenarios, and 
competing to see who can destroy 
the most enemies. PopularMMOs 
is also a great place to become 
familiar with maps and mods you 
never knew existed, as they’re 
constantly trying out new ones.  
If you’re not much into the add-on 
stuff, there’s a Let’s Play series 
where Pat, shortly after starting 
the channel, played through 
Survival Mode!
IS THAT ALL THEY GOT?
While their main jam has always been Minecraft, 
there is a variety of content available. Pat made some 
videos about Five Nights at Freddy’s, The Impossible 
Quiz, Agar.io, and Slither.io. More recently he and Jen 
have been doing a lot of silly real-life challenges. Jen 
has sat in baths of pink slime, Froot Loops cereal, 
stuffed animals, ice, marshmallows, and cheese balls, 
while Pat sat in cupcake bath bombs, chocolate milk, 
and blue Gatorade. They also do other fun activities 
around the house, such as playing hide and seek, 
Twister, and a variant of rock-paper-scissors which 
involves hot sauce. Jen also regularly provides videos 
of her reacting to other content on YouTube.
PopularMMOs began with a 
dry presentation, but with 
experience came greatness. 
Pat’s personality had evolved to be 
quite animated, which ultimately 
earned him a reputation as one of the 
more notable Minecraft entertainers 
on YouTube. When Jen came along, 
however, that dynamic of silly fun had 
only intensified. Her bright and 
bubbly personality ensures they’re 
not only entertaining their viewers, 
but each other as well. To say they’re 
cute together would be an 
understatement. It’s refreshing to see 
a couple so truly in love representing

Even so, his positive attitude stands

Their channels aren’t solely 
dedicated to Minecraft, but they 
play it frequently. User-created 
mods and maps are often on 
display, with a focus on mini-
games, especially Lucky Block 
challenges. Outside of that, they’ve 
played soccer with Slimes, 
surprised a villager with a home 
makeover, had to search 
labyrinthine rooms to find a single 
button, made their way through a 
massive mirror maze, and the list 
goes on. For those curious about 
how different versions of Minecraft 
may stack up against the PC, they 
also dabble with the PS4, Xbox 
One, and Pocket Edition. You would 
think the vanilla experience would 
make things a little boring, but 
FGTeeV knows how to make their 
own fun! Also, if you’re a fan of 
Telltale Games’ story-driven 
games, they also spent a little time 
with Minecraft: Story Mode!
WHAT ELSE DO THEY DO? 
A more appropriate question would be, ‘What don’t they do?’ 
TheSkylanderBoy AndGirl channel is all about Skylanders. 
FGTeeV plays a wide array of titles, including Roblox, Redball 
4, Hello Neighbor, Five Nights at Freddy’s, Slither.io, Agar.io, 
Pokémon Go, LEGO Dimensions, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden 
Warfare, and quite a few more. They also do skits! FUNnel 
Vision is more about the family having a good time at home 
and in the real world. They go on a lot of vacations and share 
the highlights with viewers. Some of the featured locations 
are Nickelodeon Suites Resort, Hawaii, Universal Studios, 
the Atlantis Resort, and LEGOLAND. When home from 
travelling, they’ll do more low key challenges, such as testing 
sodas and Pop-Tarts to see who guesses the most flavours 
correctly. There’s also pool time fun, and Duddy even built a 
ginormous ball pit in the basement for the kids!
Watching The Family 
Gaming Team is a real treat, 
and not just because they 
consistently deliver great 
entertainment. It’s refreshing to see 
the family dynamic at play, and 
heartening to see that’s attracted 
millions of viewers. A select few have 
pointed their finger at the parents, 
accusing them of exploiting their 
children for fame and money. This 
critique comes from viewing other, 
unrelated channels, where parents 
scare their kids or break their hearts, 
but you know the old saying, right? 
Don’t judge a book by its cover. 
Family comes first on FGTeeV, and 
other than the high quality of 
content they provide, this is what 
makes their channels stand out from 
the rest.

You. Yes, you, reader! You seem like a

probably have all sorts of fun adventures in 
the game, no matter where you’re playing. 
At some point, you might have to call it a 
day, save your game, and shut down. After 
all, no matter how much you’re enjoying the 
game’s worlds, we all still have to go outside 
and get some fresh air! Did you know that 
you can feasibly have your own Minecraft 
adventure outside of the game? The worlds

Papercraft is essentially building 
models out of certain sheets of 
paper, whether it’s poster board, 
paper board, or card stock. 
Although it may be easier than 
origami, where you fold paper in 
very intricate ways, papercraft 
requires just as much care. While 
a blank sheet of paper may not 
seem as interesting as building 
blocks or model kits, you’d be 
surprised what you can create 
from them.
You can practically have your own real-
life Minecraft adventure going in your

PAPERCRAFT
If you’re the type who can’t get Minecraft out of the brain, 
maybe you’d like to take some of that love outside of the 
game! There are many ways to express your excitement and 
passion for Minecraft, whether it’s through song or 
storytelling (in fact we have a story on Page 124, A Hero’s 
Journey!), or if you just can’t stop building: why not try your 
hand at papercraft?

STEVE
Enjoy this cut-out of our main 
Minecraft hero. Players 
everywhere have taken Steve 
on zillions of adventures, 
dressed him in the toughest 
armour, gave him the best 
weapons. Where would we be 
without Steve, who’s explored 
so many worlds and, with 
players, accomplished so 
many feats? Steve has 
certainly made his mark in 
history, standing among 
other gaming greats!

CREEPER
The Creeper is probably the most iconic of Minecraft’s 
monsters. These, well, creepy fellows love to be super 
silent and sneak up behind you. As soon as you see 
them turn red, run away, because creepers LOVE to 
explode and not only hurt you, but any areas you were 
hanging around will be utterly destroyed. You can 
create your own papercraft Creeper now. Hopefully it 
doesn’t explode! (It doesn’t. Don’t worry.)

CHICKEN
Chickens are either great pals 
or they make for delicious 
meals! In Minecraft, they are 
incredibly useful in your 
survival. You can feel free to 
build a whole farm of them 
and collect their eggs. 
Chickens are pretty abundant 
in the world of Minecraft, and 
they’re a resource so popular 
that even ocelots always try 
to catch one!

ARDUINO MODS
ARDUINO MODS 
& MINECRAFT
The technical term for Arduino is 
program logic controller that can 
assign and receive commands to 
execute tasks. You may be asking, 
“Isn’t that… a computer?” You’d 
be right! These computers like 
Arduino or Raspberry Pi are one 
great way to get into electronics 
and programming. Usually these 
types of computers tend to be 
pretty small and can be used in 
real-world situations to carry out 
tasks, even if it’s not related to 
computing or automation fields. 
For example, a baker sends a 
tweet from an Arduino-
configured switch in his kitchen 
whenever he has just taken 
certain baked goods out of the 
oven. With a push of a button, 
even less than it would take on a 
smartphone, his customers are 
instantly notified. True story! The 
thought of robotics and 
automation may sound 
overwhelming right away, but the 
beauty of PLCs like Arduino is 
they’re designed to be tinkered 
and played with to make great 
learners’ tools!
We’ve looked at the ways you 
can make Minecraft a far 
more stunningly gorgeous 
game. We’ve also taken a look 
at some of the ways in which 
you can mod your game, 
making your adventure a lot 
easier. Did you know that you 
can take Minecraft mods a 
step further? We can actually 
use Minecraft as a sort of 
programming tool. When we 
play games, we’re technically 
manipulating them through 
the hardware that is mapped 
out to command inputs. 
We can also use the software 
to talk to the hardware. 
One example is through the 
use of Arduino, a small,  
open-source electronics kit  
and computer.

MCREATOR 
MCreator is one such mod that closes the gap between Minecraft and the real world 
by using modded blocks to control a configured LED board by talking to the Arduino 
via custom code. Here are the steps to get started.
LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN USE THESE KITS ALONGSIDE MINECRAFT. 
WHAT YOU’LL NEED
1.  A copy of Minecraft installed for PC/
Windows. Run it at least once.
2.  An Arduino program logic controller. 
You can purchase various ones on the 
Arduino official site. The Uno or Mega 
2650 models are preferable.
3.  An RGB LED, a 220 ohm resistor, and 
some hook-up wires for the actual lighting.
DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE
4.  You’ll need to download MCreator, an 
incredibly useful program to create 
mods for Minecraft without deep 
programming knowledge. You’ll need 
this program to create custom blocks 
to talk to Arduino.
5.  Download the Arduino  
integrated development environment 
(IDE) from the official Arduino site.  
There are versions for both  
Windows and macOS.
CREATE THE CIRCUIT
6.  Build the circuit for Arduino using 
the following schematics. As you 
become more confident in your 
programming and electronics 
skills, you can modify it later as 
you wish.
REMEMBER TO BACK UP YOUR MINECRAFT FOLDER TO COVER YOUR BASES.  
SEE OUR SECTION ON MODS FOR MORE ON THAT!

ARDUINO MODS
CONNECT TO THE COMPUTER 
7.  With a USB cable, connect the 
Arduino to your computer.
PROGRAMMING ARDUINO 
8.  After you’ve connected the Arduino, open 
the IDE.
9.  Open the sketch.ino file located in the 
sketch sub-directory. Under Tools, find 
your port and make sure it’s checked off.
UPLOAD 
THE SKETCH 
FILE
Click the arrow pointing  
right to upload the  
sketch file to the Arduino so 
the hardware can 
communicate.

LIFECRAFT

12.  As you’re assigning events to the block, you 
will see the option to add custom code. This 
is the code to send data to Arduino. 
String msg = “[your data]”; 
try{java.net.DatagramSocket socket = new 
java.net.DatagramSocket();socket.send(new 
java.net.DatagramPacket((msg+””+(ch
ar)13).getBytes() 
,(msg+””+(char)13).getBytes().length,java.
net.InetAddress.getByName(“127.0.0.1”),505
0));socket.close();}catch(Exception e){} 
 
You can replace “[your data]” with the colour 
of your choice.
CONNECT 
MCREATOR TO ARDUINO
13.  Once the sketch is uploaded  
to Arduino, you can  
connect it to MCreator.  
Simply locate the 
MCreatorArduinoConnector.jar 
file and open it. You will need to 
do this every time you want to 
connect the mod to Arduino.
Find the appropriate port to 
make sure the connection  
is active.
START YOUR GAME 
14.  Once you have your block 
ready, go into your game 
and lay out your block. 
Remember that you’ll need 
redstone to get things like 
switches and buttons to 
work. The MCreator 
interface should ask for the 
options you designed, and so 
the switch or lever should light 
the LED up exactly as assigned.
And that’s all 
there is to it for 
MCreator and Arduino. You 
can use the device to try other 
programming executions: Get 
the game or the device to send a 
string text, or flash an LED 
when a certain mob is 
nearby. You might pick up 
some handy tricks 
along the way.
OPEN MCREATOR
11.  Once you have everything set up and 
MCreator started, use the interface to 
create a block.

trekked across 
the valley and hiked up its 
side. After about 15 minutes, I found a 
massive oak tree with a gaping mouth at its 
base and balled myself up inside. It took 
very little time for me to doze off.
A ghastly moan woke me up. I kept my sword 
beside me in case some animal decided to 
sneak up and maul me, but this was no 
animal. A few moments later as it shuffled 
past the tree, I finally got a look at what had 
made the sound. It stood on two legs, had on 
a pair of shoes, tattered blue jeans and shirt, 
and its skin was unnaturally green. I couldn’t 
believe it, but I was looking at a man, or at 
least something that used to be. It was a 
zombie. I knew it couldn’t be, and yet…
I reached for my sword but knocked it over. It 
crunched a couple of leaves, grabbing the 
zombie’s attention. My cover blown, I grabbed 
my stuff and ran towards the valley as fast as 
I could. As I ran, more zombies attempted to 
close in on me. They were slow, so outrunning 
them was easy, but it wouldn’t be long before 
I tired. I had to find shelter, and quick.

long, but I breathed a sigh of relief when it 
became clear they couldn’t penetrate my 
stone barrier. So I’m safe, at least for 
now. But I’m tired and hungry, and to 
make the best out of a bad situation, I’m 
going to close my eyes and hopefully get 
some sleep.
DAY 3
And I thought that tree from the first night 
was bad…
I didn’t hear anything when I woke up, so I 
removed the barrier and found the monsters 
had vanished. I really needed food, but I was 
going to need a more reliable shelter, so I 
spent the day collecting materials and 
building one in the centre of the valley. It 
ended up being quite small. I installed doors 
on each end so I wouldn’t get trapped, and 
the other two walls had windows just big 
enough to see out of. Then, I took some time 
to make a stronger sword and pickaxe out of 
cobblestone. After a bit of contemplation, I 
I ran across the valley and headed up the 
stone mountain. Desperate, I grabbed my 
pickaxe and started work on a hole. After a 
few solid swings, I turned around to see how 
much time I had left. The zombies were just 
beginning to funnel out of the wooded 
mountain. Just then, a gust of wind brushed 
my cheek. I looked up the mountainside to 
see where it came from, and saw skeletons, 
armed with bows and arrows and ready to 
draw more! 
After a few more swings of the pickaxe, my 
job was done. I had removed enough stone to 
wedge myself inside the mountain. Without 
hesitation, I tossed myself inside and sealed 
the entrance shut with some cobblestone. 
There were plenty of moans outside before

also built a furnace outside. It felt like a 
luxury item I didn’t need, but if I had a 
successful hunt anytime soon, I didn’t want a 
little rain to spoil my ability to cook a meal. I 
finished just as the sun was getting ready to 
say goodnight. Then, I went inside my hut, 
collapsed on the floor, and passed out. 
Once again I was awoken by moans. Looking 
out the windows, I saw a small army of 
zombies, but they were avoiding the fire’s 
glow like the plague… and then it dawned on 
me. These things didn’t like light! To test this 
theory, I stepped outside, grabbed a torch, 
and took a few steps forward. The zombies 
closest to me shuffled out of my way. So, I 
kept moving, carving a path through the 
mob as I went. I was thrilled by my 
discovery… so of course it started to rain. A 
few drops were quickly followed by a 
downpour. Torch out, I ran through the mob 
to get back to my shed. Once inside, I 
slammed the door shut, grabbed my stuff,

and opened the back door to 
make my exit. 
There were no zombies to greet me, but 
rather a green, rectangular creature 
without arms, eyes black as night, and a 
mouth twisted into a frown like an evil jack-
o-lantern. It charged at me faster than I 
had anticipated, hissing all the way. I tried 
to close the door, but couldn’t do it in time. 
There was a deafening ‘boom’, and I was 
suddenly lifted off my feet and thrown 
against the front door. Vision blurred, I 
shook my head to see what had happened. 
That thing creeping outside was gone, but 
the entire back end of my shelter had been 
blown to smithereens. That ‘creeper’ had 
blown itself up just to get me! 
No longer safe from the zombies, I once 
again grabbed my stuff and ran as fast as I 
could. I made my way back to the hole I 
made in the stone mountain, made it a 
little larger, crawled inside, lit a torch, and 
then sealed the entrance. 
I don’t know how much longer I can keep 
going like this.
DAY 4
Once the sun was up, I ran back to what 
remained of my shelter and saw the furnace 
was still intact, so I killed a cow and cooked as 
much meat as I could. It was the first bit of 
food I had in days, and nothing had ever 
tasted better in my entire life. I packed up all 
the leftovers I could and gathered my things.
It’s time to begin my journey. I don’t know 
where I’ll go, I just know that I can’t stay 
here. I’m not sure how long I can survive 
against these nocturnal dangers, so my 
goal is to find someone, anyone. Working 
alongside someone will only  
increase my chance of survival…  
I just hope I don’t perish  
before then.
