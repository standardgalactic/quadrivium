Darwin was right
From   Daniel Dennett ,   Jerry Coyne , 
 Richard Dawkins  and   Paul Myers 
What on earth were you thinking 
when you produced a garish cover 
proclaiming that “Darwin was 
wrong” (  24 January )?
First, it’s false, and second, it’s 
inflammatory. And, as you surely 
know, many readers will interpret 
the cover not as being about 
Darwin, the historical figure, 
but about evolution.
Nothing in the article showed 
that the concept of the tree of life 
is unsound; only that it is more 
complicated than was realised 
before the advent of molecular 
genetics. It is still true that all of 
life arose from “a few forms or… 
one”, as Darwin concluded in  The 
Origin of Species. It is still true that 
it diversified by descent with 
modification via natural selection 
and other factors.
Of course there’s a tree; it’s just 
more of a banyan than an oak at 
its single-celled-organism base. 
The problem of horizontal gene-
transfer in most non-bacterial 
species is not serious enough to 
obscure the branches we find by 
sequencing their DNA.
The accompanying editorial 
makes it clear that you knew 
perfectly well that your cover was 
handing the creationists a golden 
opportunity to mislead school 
boards, students and the general 
public about the status of 
evolutionary biology. Indeed, 
within hours of publication 
members of the Texas State 
Board of Education were citing 
the article as evidence that 
teachers needed to teach 
creationist-inspired “weaknesses 
of evolution”, claiming: “Darwin’s 
tree of life is wrong”.
You have made a lot of extra, 
unpleasant work for the scientists 
whose work you should be 
explaining to the general public. 
We all now have to try to correct 
all the misapprehensions your 
cover has engendered.

Due credit
From Joy Delhanty
Richard Hammond discusses 
keeping children interested in 
science (  3 January, p 14 ). The 
media have a vital role to play 
here. Their obsession with doctors 
and hospitals means that the 
scientists behind medical 
breakthroughs do not receive 
sufficient credit.
Witness the recent media 
frenzy over the birth of the first 
baby in the UK to be born free of a 
gene that would predispose her to 
breast and ovarian cancer, thanks 
to embryonic screening. All the 
credit was given to the “IVF 
doctor”; none to the laboratory 
team at University College 
London who made this advance 
possible through years of work.
There is always a team of 
scientists behind the scenes, 
whether the result is testing a 
single cell from an eight-cell 
embryo or developing gene therapy 
for blindness. If more prominence 
were given to them, youngsters 
might see a future for themselves 
in the biomedical sciences.

Truth or pare
From Sherry Seethaler, University 
of California, San Diego
A. C. Grayling suggests that “an 
international consortium of 
universities should set up panels 
to audit the worth of websites” 
(  17 January, p 44 ). Considering the 
volume of information online and 
its exponential growth, any such 
undertaking would be outdated 
before it could report.
We should not worry about the 
transcription errors that Grayling 
dwells on, so much as inadvertent 
misrepresentations of scientific 
information or the process of 
science, or deliberate attempts to 
hoodwink. People need tools to 
defend themselves against these – 
tools such as those I describe in 
my book Lies, Damned Lies, and 
Science: How to sort through the 
noise around global warming, the 
latest health claims, and other 
scientific controversies (FT Press 
Science, 2009).
To help people function in the 
information age, our education 
system needs to shift from an 
emphasis on memorising facts 
to an emphasis on equipping 
students with the tools they need 
to critique information.
Students need to learn about 
the tricky ways in which statistics 
are used; why there are legitimate 
reasons that scientists disagree;  
how media often misrepresent 
these disagreements; the 
importance of consulting 
multiple sources and seeking the 
original source when possible; 
and so on. Unlike a list of good and 
bad websites, these kinds of tools 
help people critique new 
information as it comes along.

Tetris to the rescue
From Ruth Hill
I can confirm, from personal 
experience, that post-traumatic 
stress can be moderately 
alleviated by Tetris ( 17 January, 
p 12 ). Having had two nervous 
breakdowns in the last five years, 
I needed (and still need) to find 
some way of suppressing my 
thoughts, memories and 
flashbacks of trauma.
Not being a drinker and being 
too middle-class to have access 
to illegal drugs – and finding 
prescription drugs ineffective – 
I was fortunate to stumble across 
the distraction of Tetris – which 
I played day and night for many 
months. I played to the extent 
that I acquired repetitive strain 
injury. I find it requires such 
extensive spatial and visual 
brainpower that it disengages my 
capacity for verbal thought and 
brings relief from anxiety and

Put one of the letters C, L, X, V, I into 
each cell of a 5 × 5 grid so that each 
row and each column is a valid five-
letter Roman numeral less than 300. 
No numeral may appear more than 
once; the five horizontal numerals 
should be in descending numerical 
order from top to bottom, and the 
five vertical numerals in descending 
numerical order from left to right. 
What is the sum of your 10 
Roman numerals (expressed 
in ordinary Arabic numerals)?
