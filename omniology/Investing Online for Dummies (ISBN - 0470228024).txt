About the Author
Matt Krantz is a nationally known financial journalist who specializes on
investing topics. He has been a writer for USA TODAY since 1999, where he
covers financial markets and Wall Street, concentrating on developments
affecting individual investors and their portfolios. His stories routinely signal
trends that investors can profit from and sound warnings about potential
scams and issues investors should be aware of. 
In addition to covering markets for the print edition of USA TODAY, Matt
writes a daily online investing column called “Ask Matt,” which appears every
trading day at USATODAY.com. He answers questions posed by the Web site’s
audience in an easy-to-understand manner. Readers often tell Matt he’s the
only one who has been able to finally solve investing questions they’ve
sought answers to for years. 
Matt has been investing since the 1980s and has studied dozens of investment
techniques while forming his own. And as a financial journalist, Matt has
interviewed some of the most famous and infamous investment minds in
modern history. Before joining USA TODAY, Matt worked as a business and
technology reporter for Investor’s Business Daily and was a consultant with
Ernst & Young prior to that. 
He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration at Miami University
in Oxford, Ohio. Unlike other business majors who just focused on accounting,
finance, and investments, Matt took journalism classes on his own time. He
was an editor of the campus newspaper and filed stories to several newspapers,
including The Cincinnati Enquirer. 
In addition to appearing on the print and online pages of USA TODAY, Matt’s
work has also been featured in Men’s Health magazine. He has spoken for
investing groups, including at the national convention of BetterInvesting and
on Nightly Business Report, which airs on PBS.
Matt is based in USA TODAY’s Los Angeles bureau. When he’s not writing,
he’s either spending time with his wife and young daughter, running, playing
tennis, mountain biking, or surfing. 


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife Nancy, who has supported and carried me
throughout the entire project from the very beginning. During the bleary-
eyed writing sessions sitting in front of the computer at 1 a.m., Nancy was
always there to suggest that perfect word I couldn’t think of, bring in fresh-
cut strawberries, or read every single page. The book is also dedicated to my
daughter, Leilani, who put up with a Dad who was almost as nervous about
being a first-time book author as he was to be a first-time parent. 
Author’s Acknowledgments
Staring at a flashing cursor on a blank Microsoft Word window, knowing I
needed to fill hundreds of pages in a few months, was an intimidating task.
That’s why all the support I received kept me going. My editors at USA TODAY
supported the book from its genesis and encouraged me along the way. My
assignment editor, David Craig, as well as other USA TODAY editors, including
Rodney Brooks, Ray Goldbacher, Jim Henderson, John Hillkirk, Ken Paulson,
Geri Coleman Tucker, and Kinsey Wilson, have supported this book or my
development as a writer and reporter. Chris Woodyard, a fellow business
reporter in USA TODAY’s Los Angeles bureau, has been a great source of ideas
and daily encouragement. My wife, Nancy, continued her personal mission of
stomping out every typo on the planet by reading every word in this book
over my shoulder. 
Wiley has been tremendous to work with as well, including Senior Acquisitions
Editor Bob Woerner, Senior Project Editor Paul Levesque, and Copy Editor
Virginia Sanders. Julie Huynh, technical editor, made sure the book was free
of “dead links” by checking every URL. Big thanks to Matt Wagner, my literary
agent, for thinking of me for the project and presenting it to me. Fane Lozman
provided a hand by sharing his options expertise. Thanks to my mom and
dad for instilling, at a very young age, a curiosity in investing, writing, and
computers (and for buying me my first computer well before having a PC was
common). And thanks to my grandparents for teaching me the power of
saving and investing.

Introduction
You might be wondering why you need a book like this one to help you
invest online. After all, if you’re looking for information about investing
online, you can certainly type “investing online” into a search engine and get
thousands of search results. 
But that’s the problem. You’ll get thousands of search results. Some of the
sites you’ll find using a search engine might have secret agendas and push
financial products hazardous to your goals. Yet other sites offered up by a
search engine might be filled with bad information that isn’t correct, causing
you to unknowingly make poor investment decisions. Worse yet, you might
stumble on fraudulent Web sites determined to steal your identity or money.
Sure, you might find some good Web sites through a Web search, but how can
you tell the good from the bad when you get hundreds, if not thousands of
results? 
Along came Investing Online For Dummies, 6th Edition. This book is here 
to act as a down-to-Earth guide for getting started with online investing. I
steer you clear of unnecessary investing gobbledygook, and I point you to
resources that you can trust. I’ve already done all the mucking through the
thousands of investing Web sites to find good ones — there’s no reason you
should have to do so as well!
About This Book
Investing Online For Dummies has been completely rewritten in this sixth edi-
tion to be your intelligent guide through this often confusing and constantly
changing world of investing online. As the author, I can share the tricks, tips,
and secrets I’ve learned from a career writing about online investing for read-
ers just like you. This book can save you the trouble of fumbling through the
Internet looking for the best online resources. I’m in the fortunate position of
knowing what kind of information you’re looking for thanks to what I do. 
Not only am I a markets reporter for USA TODAY, but each day I answer
investing questions e-mailed to me through my daily online “Ask Matt”
column at USATODAY.com. I’ve answered thousands of reader questions.
That puts me in the position of knowing what questions most investors, and
perhaps you, tend to have. Much of the wisdom I’ve picked up writing about
investing and answering readers’ questions is presented in this book. 

Don’t worry, Investing Online For Dummies isn’t just a directory of Web sites
that robotically lists hundreds of Web site addresses and leaves it up to you
to look everything up. Those directory-type books, I’ve found, tend to be
frustrating for investors looking for a road map and some handholding to get
started investing online. Instead, I’ve taken special care to bake in principles
about investing first and then show you how to use the Internet and your
computer to boost your success.
This book doesn’t attempt to highlight every single investing Web site, but
instead, it focuses on the best ones. Most of the sites I’ve selected have been
around long enough to prove to be reliable and accurate. And because this
book’s purpose is to help you make and save money, not spend it, it sticks
mainly to Web sites that are free. When a site requires a subscription, I let
you know so you can decide whether the fee is worthwhile. 
I have one big caveat. Keep in mind as you enter the addresses of some of the
Web pages that the Internet is so fast-changing, you might encounter a link or
two that no longer works. Don’t assume the site has gone to Internet heaven.
Try entering the name of the site into a search engine using techniques
described in the first part of the book. More times than not, you’ll find the
site is still online but has just changed its address slightly. Similarly, even if a
Web page isn’t quite how I describe it, the page might have been changed, so
you might have to ditch my instructions and play around to find how what’s
different.
Who Invests Online?
Online investing isn’t just an interesting niche for techies and day traders.
More than 9 million households will trade online in 2007, estimates market
research firm Forrester Research.* And that number is expected to soar by
more than 30% and hit 12 million households by 2011 as long as the stock
market posts moderate gains, Forrester says. Online stock trading has taken
off so much that it was named the 18th top “eureka” moment since 1982 by
USA TODAY, ahead of disposable contacts, TiVo, and home satellite TV.
Research has found out several things about online investors:
 They’re young. Generation Y (ages 18 to 26) and Generation X (ages 27
to 40) are big online investors with 19% of the group reporting they’ve
invested online at some point in 2005, Forrester says, citing the most
recent data available. That’s nearly double the 10% of boomers (ages 41
2
Investing Online For Dummies, 6th Edition 
*”US Online Trading Forecast: 2006 to 2011”, Forrester Research, Inc., February 2007.”

to 61) and seniors (aged 61 and higher) who have traded online,
Forrester says. 
 They’re wealthy. Investing online won’t necessarily make you rich, but
many of the rich do invest online. More than 20% of affluent households,
with $1 million in assets, traded online, and 15% of households with
assets between $100,000 and $999,999 traded online in 2005, Forrester
says, citing its most recent data. 
 They’re Web savvy. The longer people have Internet access, the more
interested they get in investing online. Although only 2% of households
that had online access for just a year traded online in 2006, 16% of house-
holds that had online access for eight years or more did, Forrester says.
And more people are becoming Web savvy. Forrester estimates that as of
2007 76% of U.S. households are online at least once a month, up from
57% in 2000. 
Foolish Assumptions
No matter your skill or experience level with investing, you can get some-
thing out of Investing Online For Dummies. I assume some readers haven’t
invested in anything other than baseball cards or Pez dispensers and have no
clue of where to even start. If that describes you, the first part of the book is
custom made for you and takes extra care to step through all the key points
in as much plain English as possible. (When I have no choice but to use
investing jargon, I tell you what it means.) But I also assume more advanced
investors might pick this book up too, looking to discover a few things. The
book takes on more advanced topics as you progress through it and carefully
selects online resources that will add new tools to your investing toolbox. 
Conventions Used in This Book
I want to help you get the information you need as fast as possible. To help
you, I use several conventions: 
 Monofont is used to signal a Web address. This is important since there
are so many Web addresses in the book.
 Italics signal that a word is a unique and important term for online
investors.
 Boldfaced words make the key terms and phrases in bulleted and num-
bered lists jump out and grab your attention.
3
Introduction

 Sidebars, text separated from the rest of the type in gray boxes, are
interesting but slightly tangential to the subject at hand. Sidebars are
generally fun and optional reading. You won’t miss anything critical if
you skip the sidebars. If you choose to read the sidebars, though, I think
you’ll be glad you did. 
How the Book Is Organized
All the chapters in this book are self-contained and can be read by them-
selves. That means you shouldn’t read Investing Online For Dummies like you
would War and Peace, and hopefully you won’t fall asleep as much as you
would if you read War and Peace, either. Jump around. Flip through. Scan the
index and find topics you’ve been dying to read about for years. And don’t
fear that you’ll get in over your head if you read the back of the book first. If
there are concepts you need to know at any point, I carefully added refer-
ences to those pages in the book so you can jump around. This book is a ref-
erence, and you shouldn’t feel as if you need to suffer through topics you
already know or don’t care to know. With that said, though, the book is
assembled in a logical order. My goal is to start simple and then ramp things
up as the book goes on. 
The book is divided into four parts.
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online
If you like the idea of investing online but haven’t the foggiest on where to
start, this part is for you. You find everything you need to know to get up and
running with online investing, ranging from mastering the terminology to get-
ting your computer set up for online trading. I help you decide what kind of
account to open and explain how to pick an online broker. After reading the
chapters in this part, you should have a good idea of what’s entailed in
investing online and what kinds of returns you can expect.
Part II: Using Online Investing Resources
Ever see a campy science fiction movie? More often than not, the plot
involves some sort of computer that ends up ruling humans. If you’ve ever
seen people struggling with and cursing at their computers, that sci-fi night-
mare isn’t all that far-fetched. This part lets you turn the tables on the
Machine and put the Internet to work for you, rather than getting worked
4
Investing Online For Dummies, 6th Edition 

over by the Internet. I show you how to get your computer to help you design
the perfect portfolio for you and even help you locate mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds that fit your strategy.
Part III: Maximizing Investment
Knowledge
If you’ve ever wondered why mutual fund managers get paid the big bucks
and what they do all day, you can find out in this part. Part III delves into
some advanced topics such as how to pick investments and study company’s
financials. What’s unique about this part, however, is that it shows you how
to do these advanced analyses using your computer and the Internet. 
Part IV: The Part of Tens
These final and short chapters wrap up many of the basic lessons illustrated
throughout the book in easy-to-digest nuggets. You’ll find ways to avoid
making the 10 most common online investment mistakes as well as ways to
protect your money and identity online. 
Bonus Chapters on the Web Site:
Alternative Investing Strategies
There’s so much to cover in this book, I couldn’t stuff it all in. No worries. A
few offbeat — but still important — investments are covered in this part and
made available to you online at www.dummies.com/go/iofd. Don’t think
this part isn’t as important because it’s only online. This part covers interna-
tional investing, which is something that belongs in almost all investors’ port-
folios. You can also find information on how to read online stock charts and
study initial public offerings. And, for good measure, I take the time to answer
questions that seem to enter the minds of nearly all online investors at some
point or another.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
When you’re flipping through this book, you might notice several icons that
catch your attention. That’s done on purpose. I use several distinct icons to
alert you to sections of the book that stand out. Those icons are
These icons highlight info that you should etch on the top of your brain and
never forget, even when you’re getting caught up in the excitement of invest-
ing online.
Read these sections to quickly pick up insider secrets that can boost your
success when investing online. 
Some of the things covered in the book get a bit hairy and complicated. This
icon flags such sections for two reasons. First, you may decide to avoid the
headache and skip over them — the info isn’t vital. Second, the icon is a
heads-up that the paragraph is probably loaded with investment jargon.
Don’t be embarrassed if you need to read the section a second or third time.
Hey, you didn’t want this book to be too easy, did you?
Avoid the landmines scattered throughout Wall Street that can decimate your
good intentions at building wealth with these sections. 
Where to Go from Here
If you’re a new investor or just getting started investing online, you might
consider starting from the beginning. That way, you’ll be ready for some of
the more advanced topics I introduce later in the book. If you’ve already been
investing online, have a strategy you think is working for you, and are pleased
with your online broker, you might skip to Part II. And if you’re dying to know
about a specific topic, there’s nothing wrong with looking up those terms in
the index and flipping to the appropriate pages.

Investing Online

In this part . . . 
T
he idea of investing online is irresistible to most
investors. Low trading commissions, cutting out high-
price brokers, and gaining tremendous ﬁnancial control are
all possible with online investing. What’s not to like, right? 
The trouble, though, for many investors is how to get
started. Investing online is laden with enough jargon and
Web sites to send some beginners running. Consider this
part to be your user’s manual on how to get started invest-
ing online. You discover everything you need to know to
get yourself and your computer ready to pick, buy, and sell
investments online. I go over all the key terms you need to
know to set up investment accounts, pick a broker, and get
started. Even more importantly, you discover the main
ways to invest online and quickly gain the wisdom of more
experienced investors. You also ﬁnd the answers to two of
the most commonly asked questions investors ask me:
“How do I get started investing online?” and “How much
money do I need to invest online?”

f you’ve ever watched a baby learn to walk, you’ve seen how cautious
humans are by nature. Babies will hold themselves against a wall and
scoot along before actually going toe-to-toe with gravity and trying to walk.
That skepticism stays with most people as they get older. Before doing some-
thing risky, you probably think good and hard about what you stand to gain
and what you might lose. Surprisingly, many online investors, especially
those just starting out, lose that innate sense of risk and reward. They chase
after the biggest possible returns without considering the sleepless nights
they’ll suffer through as those investments swing up and down. Some start
buying investments they’ve heard others made money on without consider-
ing whether those investments are appropriate for them. Worst of all, some
fall prey to fraudsters who promise huge returns in get-rich-quick schemes. 
So, I’ve decided to start from the top and make sure the basics are covered.
You discover what you can expect to gain from investing online — and at
what risk — so you can decide whether this is for you. You also find out how
to analyze your monthly budget so you have cash to invest in the first place.
Lastly, you find what kind of investor you are by using online tools that 
measure your taste for risk. After you’ve gotten to know your inner investor
better, you can start thinking about forming an online investment plan that
won’t give you an ulcer.

Why Investing Online 
Is Worth Your While
Investing used to be easy. Your friend would recommend a broker. You’d give
your money to the broker and hope for the best. But today, thanks to the
explosion of Web-based investment information and low-cost online trading,
you get to work a lot harder by taking charge of your investments. Lucky you!
So, is the additional work worth it? In my opinion, taking the time to figure
out to invest online is worthwhile because
 Investing online saves you money. Online trading is much less expen-
sive than dealing with a broker. You’ll save tons on commissions and
fees. (Say, why not invest that money you saved?)
 Investing online gives you more control. Instead of entrusting someone
else to reach your financial goals, you’ll be personally involved. It’s up to
you to find out about all the investments at your disposal, but you’ll also
be free to make decisions.
 Investing online eliminates conflicts of interest. By figuring out how to
invest and doing it yourself, you won’t have to worry about being given
advice that might be in your advisors’ best interest and not yours.
Getting Started
I can’t tell you how many investors just starting out write me and ask the
exact same question. Maybe it’s the same question running through your
head right now: “I want to invest but where do I start?” 
Getting started in investing seems so overwhelming that some get confused
and wind up giving up and doing nothing. Others get taken in by promises of
gigantic returns and enroll in seminars, subscribe to stock-picking newslet-
ters, or agree to invest in odd assets like payphones, only to be disappointed.
Others assume that all they need to do is open a brokerage account and start
madly buying stocks. But as you’ll notice if you look at the Table of Contents
or flip ahead in this book, I don’t talk about picking a broker and opening an
account until Chapter 4. You have many tasks to do before then.
But don’t let that fact intimidate you. Check out my easy-to-follow list of
things you’ll need to do to get started. Follow these directions, and you’ll be
ready to open an online brokerage account and start trading: 
1. Decide how much you can save and invest. 
You can’t invest if you don’t have any money, and you won’t have any
money if you don’t save. No matter how much you earn, you need to set
10
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

aside some money to start investing. (Think saving is impossible? I show
you computer and online tools later in this chapter that can help you
build up savings that you can invest.)
2. Master the terms.
The world of investing has its own language. I help you to understand
investingese now so you don’t get confused in the middle of a trade
when you’re asked to make a decision about something you’ve never
heard of. (Chapter 2 has more on the language of online investing.) 
3. Familiarize yourself with the risks and returns of investing. 
You wouldn’t jump out of an airplane without knowing the risks, right?
Don’t jump into investing without knowing what to expect, either.
Luckily, online resources I show you later in this chapter and in Chapter 8
can help you get a feel for how markets have performed over the past
100 years. By understanding how stocks, bonds, and other investments
have done, you’ll know what is a reasonable return and set your goals
appropriately. 
I can’t stress how important this step is. Investors who know how invest-
ments move don’t panic — they keep their cool. Panic is your worst
enemy because it has a way of talking you into doing things you’ll regret
later.
4. Get a feel for how much risk you can take. 
People all have different goals for their money. You might already have a
home and a car, in which case you’re probably most interested in saving
for retirement or building an estate for your heirs. Or perhaps you’re
starting a family and hope to buy a house within a year. These two sce-
narios call for very different tastes for risks and time horizons (how long
you’d be comfortable investing money before you need it). You need to
know what your taste for risk is before you can invest. I show you how
to measure your taste for risk later in this chapter. 
5. Understand the difference between being an active and passive
investor. 
Some investors want to outsmart the market by darting in and out of
stocks at just the right times. Others think doing that is impossible and
don’t want the hassle of trying. At the end of this chapter, you find out
how to distinguish between these two types of investors, active and pas-
sive, so that you’re in a better position to choose which one you are.
6. Find out how to turn your computer into a trading station. 
If you have a computer on your desk and a connection to the Internet,
you have all you need to turn it into a source of constant market infor-
mation. You just need to know where to look, which you find out in
Chapter 2.
11
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

7. Take a dry run.
Don’t laugh. Many professional money managers have told me they got
their starts by pretending to pick stocks and tracking how they would
have done. It’s a great way to see whether your strategy might work,
before potentially losing your shirt. You can even do this online, which I
cover in Chapter 2. 
8. Choose the type of account you’ll use.
You can do your investing from all sorts of accounts, all with different
advantages and disadvantages. I cover them a little in this chapter and
go into more detail in Chapter 3. 
9. Set up an online brokerage account.
At last, the moment you’ve been waiting for: opening an online account.
After you’ve tackled the preceding steps, you’re ready to get going. This
important step is covered in Chapter 4. 
10. Understand the different ways to place trades and enter orders.
I explain in Chapter 5 about the many different ways to buy and sell
stocks, each with very different end results. (You also need to under-
stand the tax ramifications of selling stocks, which I cover in Chapter 3.)
11. Boost your knowledge.
After you have the basics down, you’re ready to tackle the later parts of
the book, where I cover advanced investing topics. This involves picking
12
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
The danger of doing nothing
After reading through the 11 steps for getting
started, you might be wondering whether
you’ve taken on more than you bargained for.
Stick with it. The worst thing you can do now is
put this book down, tell yourself you’ll worry
about investing later, and do nothing. 
Doing nothing is extremely costly because you
lose money if you don’t invest. Seriously. Even if
you stuffed your cash under a mattress and
didn’t spend a dime, each year that money
becomes worth, on average, 3% less due to
inflation. Suppose you won $1 million in the lot-
tery and stuffed it in a hole in your backyard
with the plan of taking it out in 30 years to pay
for your retirement. In 30 years, all 1 million
greenbacks would still be there, but they’d only
buy $400,000 worth of goods. InflationData
(www.inflationdata.com) has many
online tools that show inflation drives up the
costs of goods and services.
Even if you put your extra cash in a savings
account, you’re not doing much better. Because
savings accounts usually let you get the money
anytime, they pay low levels of interest, around
1 to 2%. Even high-yield savings accounts and
Certificates of Deposit (CDs) typically pay only
slightly higher interest than the level of inflation,
meaning you’re barely keeping up and not get-
ting ahead. To be successful, you need to move
money you don’t need for a while out of savings
and into investments. Investments have the
potential to generate much higher returns. 

an asset allocation (covered in Chapter 9), researching stocks to buy
and knowing when to sell (covered in Chapter 13), and evaluating more
exotic investments (the stuff you find in the chapters contained in the
bonus chapters on the Web).
Measuring How Much You 
Can Afford to Invest
Online investing can help you accomplish some great things. It can help 
you pay for a child’s college tuition, buy the house you’ve been eyeing, retire,
or travel to the moon. Okay, maybe not the last one. But you get the idea.
Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation. And by investing
online, you can profit even more by reducing the commissions and fees you
must pay to different advisors and brokers. 
One thing online investing cannot do is make something out of nothing. To
make money investing online, you have to save money first. Don’t get frus-
trated, though, because you don’t need as much to get started as you might
fear. If you have a job or source of income, building up ample seed money
isn’t too hard. 
Turning yourself into a big saver
If you want to be an investor, you must find ways to spend less money now so
you can save the excess. That means you must retrain yourself from being a
consumer to being an investor. Many beginning investors have trouble get-
ting past this point because being a consumer is so easy. Consumers buy
assets that they can use and enjoy, but almost all of those assets lose value
over time. Cars, electronic gadgets, and clothing are all examples of things
consumers “invest” their money in. You don’t even have to have money to
spend — plenty of credit card companies will gladly loan it to you. Consumers
fall into this spending pattern vortex and end up living paycheck-to-paycheck
with nothing left to invest.
Investors, on the other hand, find ways to put off current consumption.
Instead of spending money, they invest it into building businesses or goods
and services that will earn money, rather than deplete it. The three main
types of investments are stocks, bonds, and real estate, although there are
others that I cover in the later chapters.

Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

Here are a few things you can do now to help you change from being a con-
sumer to an investor:
 Start with what you can manage by putting aside a little each month.
 Keep increasing what you put aside. If you do it gradually, you won’t
feel the sting of a suddenly pinched pocket.
 Hunt for deals and use coupons and discounts. Put aside the saved
money.
 Buy only what you need. Don’t be fooled into buying things you don’t
need because they’re on sale.
Using personal finance software
The word budget is a real turnoff. It conjures up images of sitting at the
kitchen table with stacks of crumpled-up receipts, trying to figure out where
all your money went. As an investor who prefers to do things online, this
image probably isn’t too appealing. 
It’s worth your while to find other ways to see how much money is coming 
in and how much is going out. Fortunately, you have a painless option avail-
able: personal finance software, which helps you track your spending and
investments. 
Take a look at these two big names in personal finance software:
14
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Scouring the Web for savings help
Even fastidious savers have unavoidable basic
expenses. Investors, though, find ways to be
smart about even these routine costs. These
sites can help: 
 Feed The Pig (www.feedthepig.com)
urges you to stop wasting money and offers
tips to help you get out of debt by cutting
excess spending. The site can calculate
how to get out of debt and even how much
you can save by packing a lunch instead of
buying one. 
 Get Rich Slowly(www.getrichslowly.
org) provides tips, calculators, and online
tools to help you save more so you can
invest more.
 The Consumerist (www.consumerist.
com), offers tips to educate consumers. It
explains how to play hardball with service
providers, like cell phone companies, that
sock you with monthly fees. 

 Microsoft Money (www.microsoft.com/money) is a great tool for 
measuring how much money you can afford to invest. It helps you deter-
mine how much money you spend, where it goes, and how much excess
you accumulate each month that you can channel into investing. You
can view the results in charts, such as the one in Figure 1-1. Money can
also create a budget for you, essentially at the push of a button. The
software alerts you if you’re spending more on a certain category than
you budgeted for. The biggest gripe against the software is that you 
have to get your transactions into it first. You can type them in by hand,
which is kind of a pain, or you can download them from your credit card
company or bank. Money also costs you $30 for the Deluxe edition. My
advice: Don’t run out and buy it. First, download the free trial that lets
you test Money 2007 for three months. 
 Intuit’s Quicken (www.quicken.com), like Money, is an outstanding
tool for tracking where all your money goes. Its 2007 version introduced
a home page that shows you at a glance where your money is going. It
also offers a version for Macintosh. It costs $50 for the Deluxe edition.
Quicken, like Money, warns you if you’re spending too much on certain
types of items.

Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

Both Quicken and Money do more than help you set and stick to a budget.
Both help you with more advanced topics, such as managing your portfolio
and taxes — stuff I cover later in this book.
Not sure whether you’d like Money or Quicken? It’s really a personal deci-
sion, but if some expert opinions might sway you one way or another, you’d
be happy to know that both Money and Quicken are reviewed each year at
technology Web site CNET.com. The 2007 review can be found here: http://
reviews.cnet.com/4520-9239_7-6631482-1.html. Reviews from other
sites are compiled at ConsumerSearch.com (www.consumersearch.com/
www/software/accounting_software/index.html).
Money and Quicken might be the big kids on the block, but they aren’t alone.
Be sure to check out these other options (some of which are free!): 
 Moneydance (www.moneydance.com) comes in versions for Windows,
Macintosh, and Linux. If you’re already using Money or Quicken, no 
worries — Moneydance can translate your files. It’s comparably priced
at $30 and offers a trial that lets you use the software until you hit 100
transactions.
 Money Manager Ex (www.thezeal.com/software/index.php?
Money_Manager_Ex) tries to make the power of software like Money
and Quicken free. It’s open-source personal finance software, program-
med by hobbyists and offered to the public as a service. If you like it,
you can donate to the programmers who have created it.
 Buddi (http://buddi.sourceforge.net/en) is another free option.
But unlike the other personal finance software, Buddi is designed to
track budgets and spending, not investment portfolios. 
 PearBudget (www.pearbudget.com) is free budgeting software that
works in Microsoft Excel or other popular spreadsheet programs. The
software tracks your costs and tells you whether you’re sticking with 
the plan. 
Microsoft also provides several helpful budgeting spreadsheets, which you
can find by entering the word budget in the search field of the Microsoft
Office Templates home page (http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/
templates/default.aspx). The Web site It’s Your Money (www.mdm
proofing.com/iym/excel.htm) also provides several spreadsheets to
help you manage your money.
Perusing personal finance Web sites
Before you can put personal finance software to work, you often need to
download and install it on your computer. You then need to spend some time
16
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

figuring out how to actually use it. If that’s exactly the kind of thing that
scared you away from making a budget in the first place, you might want to
consider personal finance Web sites. Personal finance Web sites’ main benefits
include the fact they let you see your information from any PC connected to
the Internet, and you generally don’t have to install software to make them
work. Here are a few to check out:
 Mvelopes Personal (www.mvelopes.com) will be your spending cop
that tells you you’re spending too much. Mvelopes is a Web-based
spending tracker that tries to be the digital version of envelope-based
budgeting. Rather than stuffing cash in envelopes set aside for certain
expenses, Mvelopes lets you decide before you get a paycheck how
much you’re willing to spend in certain categories (such as dining out)
and plan your spending for the month. As the month progresses, you
download all your spending from banks and credit card companies and
subtract each transaction from the envelopes you set aside. That way, if
you’re spending too much on restaurants, for instance, you know to cut
back or to skimp in other areas. It also comes with some electronic bill
payment services. It’s not a cheap tool, though, and will set you back
$130 a year, although you can consider the 30-day free trial or a two-year
plan for $190. 
 Wesabe (www.wesabe.com) lets you enter your budget and track it. But
it has a twist: Other Wesabe users can see where your money is going
and offer suggestions on ways to save more. It’s free, too, which saves
you some money right away.
 Geezeo (www.geezeo.com) is designed for people who want to track
their spending, but are more likely to have a cell phone than sit in front
of a computer. With your permission, the site pulls down your account
balances from all your financial institutions. That way, when you’re
shopping, you can send a text message to Geezeo and get a message
back showing all your account balances. Hopefully that will remind you
to not spend money you don’t have. Other users also offer tips on the
Web site on how to save money.
Personal finance information sites don’t track your transactions, but 
they’re still able to give you the big picture. The following sites are worth
checking out:
 The Financial Planning Association’s Life Events & Financial Decisions
(http://fpanet.org/public/tools/lifeevents/?WT.svl=2)
lets you click on financial goals, like “becoming established,” and get
advice. 
 Smartaboutmoney.org (www.smartaboutmoney.org) provides various
tips on how to save more and boost your financial strength. 
17
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

 U.S. Financial Literacy and Education Commission (www.mymoney.
gov) is a government-run site that steps you through everything from
saving more to avoiding frauds. It’s also a good directory of useful 
information available from other government agencies.
Many financial information Web sites are designed for older investors who
are looking for information on homes, kids, and retirement. If you’re a parent
hoping your kids will be more responsible with money, check out Young
Money (www.youngmoney.com). You can find advice that’s more targeted for
young adults, such as managing credit card debt or avoiding campus scams.
Saving with Web-based 
savings calculators
If personal finance software or sites seem too much like a chore or too Big
Brotherish, you might consider Web-based tools that measure how much you
could save, in theory, based on a few parameters that you enter.
 MSN Money’s Savings Calculator (www.moneycentral.msn.com/
Investor/calcs/n_savapp/main.asp) asks you a series of ques-
tions to help you analyze your spending and find out how much you can
save, how long it’ll take you to save a certain amount, how much you
must save to meet a goal or how long it will take to save $1 million. 
 Young Money’s Home Budget Calculator (www.youngmoney.com/
calculators/personal_finance_calculators/home_budget)
helps you break down where all your money is going so you can deter-
mine how much you can save. It steps you through all your major
expenses and helps you find ways to waste less.
 Bankrate.com’s Saving for a Goal Calculator (www.bankrate.com/
brm/calc/savecalc.asp) asks you what you’re saving for, be it col-
lege or buying a car. It then breaks down your financial objective and
tells you how much you need to save to meet said objective. 
 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA) Savings Calculator
(http://apps.finra.org/investor_Information/Calculators/
nasd/SavingsCalc.aspx) lets you enter different combinations of
variables such as how much you’ve saved already and how much addi-
tional money you intend to save. It then gives you a realistic estimate of
how much you can expect to save.
 USATODAY.com’s The Real Person’s Budget (www.usatoday.com/
money/perfi/basics/2005-04-21-real-budget-story_x.htm)
was developed by a personal finance advisor to help you interactively
figure out where your money is going. 
18

Relying on the residual method
Are you the kind of person who has no idea how much money you have until
you take out a wad of twenties from the ATM and check the balance on the
receipt? If so, you’re probably not the budgeting type, and the preceding
options are too strict. For you, the best option might be to open a savings
account with your bank or open a high-yield savings account and transfer in
money you know you won’t need. Watch the savings account over the months
and find out how much it grows. That will give you a good idea of how much
you could save without even feeling it. You can find out where you can get a
high rate of interest on your savings from Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.
com/brm/rate/highyieldmma.asp?prodtype=chksav).
Using Web-based goal savings calculators
All the preceding methods help you determine how much you can save. But
the following sites help you determine how much you should save to reach
specific goals: 
 Vanguard’s retirement calculator (https://flagship.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/planningeducation/retirement/PEdRetInvSet
YrSavGoalsContent.jsp) helps you figure out how much you should
save by measuring how much you will need. The site prompts you to
enter how much you make and how long you have until retirement to
help you figure out how much you need to save. Vanguard offers similar
tools to help you decide how much you need to save for other goals,
such as paying for a child’s college.
 T. Rowe Price’s Retirement Income Calculator (www3.troweprice.
com/ric/RIC) uses advanced computerized modeling to show you how
much you need to save no matter what the stock market does. It runs
your variables through a “Monte Carlo simulation,” which simulates
what happens to your savings no matter what and gives you the odds
you’ll have enough money. It has similar tools to help you decide how
much you need to save to retire, including a Retirement Planning Work-
sheet (www.troweprice.com/common/indexHtml3/0,0,htmlid=
902,00.html?scn=T._Rowe_Price_Calcul&rfpgid=8278).
 Nationwide’s RetirAbility Check (www.nationwide.com/nw/nrri/
index.htm?wtgo=retirability) asks you some questions and then
rates your ability to retire when and how you plan to. It also suggests
tips on improving your odds of saving as much as you hope. 
 Financial Calculators (www.financialcalculators.com) can help
you calculate just about any financial goal you might have — from
buying a home to saving for college. 
19
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

Deciding How You Plan to Save
After you’ve determined how much you need to save and how much you can
save, you need to put your plan in action. The way you do this really depends
on how good you are at handling your money and saving. The different meth-
ods include: 
 Automatic withdrawals: Ever hear the cliché, “pay yourself first”? It’s a
trite saying that actually makes sense. The idea is that before you go
shopping for that big-screen TV or start feeling rich after payday, you
should set money aside for savings. Some people have the discipline to
do this themselves, but many do not. For those people, the best option
is to set up automatic withdrawals, which is a way of giving a brokerage
firm or bank permission to automatically extract money once a month.
When the money is out of your hands, you won’t be tempted to spend it. 
 Retirement plans: If your goal is investing for retirement, you want to
find out what retirement savings plans are available to you. If you’re an
employee, you might have access to a 401(k) plan. And if you’re self-
employed, you might consider various individual retirement accounts
(also known as IRAs). When you’re starting to invest, taking advantage
of available retirement plans is usually your best bet. I cover this in
more detail in Chapter 3.
 On your own: If you have money left over after paying all your bills, don’t
let it sit in a savings account. Leaving cash in a low-interest-bearing
account is like giving a bank a cheap loan. Put your money to work for
you. Brokers make it easy for you to get money to them via electronic
transfers.
20
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Being prepared for emergencies
When creating your budget and moving money
from savings to an investment account, be sure
to keep an emergency fund. This is money that’s
readily available in case of an emergency,
stored in an account you can access immedi-
ately, such as a bank savings account. A decent
guideline is to always have enough cash handy
that you could pay at least six months of living
expenses. Add up how much you spend each
month on necessities such as housing (rent or
mortgage and property taxes), food, utilities,
and transportation. Multiply by six to get a 
general idea how much you should have for
emergencies. 

Want to Be a Successful 
Investor? Start Now!
The greatest force all investors have is time. Don’t waste it. The sooner you
start to save and invest, the more likely you will be successful. To explain,
take the example of five people, each of whom want to have $1 million in the
bank by the time they retire at age 65. The first investor starts when she is 20,
followed by a 30-year-old, 40-year-old, 50-year-old, and 60-year-old. Assuming
each investor starts with nothing and averages 10% returns each year (more
on this later), Table 1-1 describes how much each must save per month to
reach his or her goals.
Table 1-1
How Much Each Must Save to Get $1 Million, Part I
An Investor Who Is 
Must Invest This Much Each Month 
to Have $1 Million at 65
20 years old
$95.40
30 years old
$263.40
40 years old
$753.67
50 years old
$2,412.72
60 years old
$12,913.71 
See, youth has its advantages. A 20-year-old who saves less than $100 a
month will end up with the same amount of money as a 60-year-old who
squirrels away $12,914 a month or $154,968 a year! That’s largely due to the
fact that money that’s invested early has more time to brew. And over time,
the money snowballs and compounds, which is a concept I cover later in 
this chapter.
Learning the Lingo
Just about any profession, hobby, or pursuit has its own lingo. Car fanatics,
chess players, and computer hobbyists have terms of art that they seem 
to learn through osmosis. Online investing is no different. Many terms, like
stocks and bonds, you might have heard but not completely understood. As
you read through this book and browse the Web sites I mention, you’ll 
probably periodically stumble on unfamiliar words. 
21
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

Don’t expect a standard dictionary to help much. Investing terms can be so
specialized and precise that old Webster might not be a big help. Fortunately,
a number of excellent online investing glossaries explain in detail what
investing terms mean. Here are few for you to check out:
 Investopedia (www.investopedia.com) has one of the most compre-
hensive databases of investing terms out there, with more than 5,000
entries. The site not only covers the basics, but explains advanced
terms in great detail as well. It’s also fully searchable so you don’t waste
time getting the answer. 
 Yahoo! Financial Glossary (http://biz.yahoo.com/f/g) is all about
quick answers. The database, written by Campbell Harvey, a professor
of finance at Duke University, explains most basic investment terms in
one or two sentences. 
 InvestorWords (www.investorwords.com) has a fully searchable data-
base of investment terms, but it also makes the dictionary a bit more
interesting with unique features like a “term of the day” and a summary
of terms that have recently rewritten definitions. 
 Investor Glossary (www.investorglossary.com) covers all the
basics but also attempts to describe some slang terms in the industry,
such as an investing philosophy known as the Dogs of the Dow.
Setting Your Expectations
Have you ever talked to a professional investor or financial advisor? One of
the first things they’ll tell you is how much experience they have. I can’t tell
you how many times I’ve been told, “I’ve been on Wall Street 30 years. I’ve
seen it all.” 
Some of that is certainly old-fashioned bragging. But these claims are
common because in investing, experience does count. It’s easy to say you
could endure a bear market until you’re watching white-knuckled and sweat-
ing bullets as your nest egg shrivels from $100,000 to $80,000 or $70,000.
Experience brings perspective, which is very important. 
But if you’re new to investing, don’t despair. Online tools can help you
acquire the brain of a grizzled Wall Street sage. And don’t forget that I’m here
to set you straight as well. In fact, I’m set to start talking about how much you
can expect to make from investing. And you’ll be hearing a great deal about a
little something called the rate of return.
22
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

Keeping up with the rate of return
Don’t let the term rate of return scare you. It’s the most basic concept in invest-
ing, and you can master it. Just remember that it’s the amount, measured as a
percent, that your investment increases in value in a certain period of time. If
you have a savings account, you understand the concept already. If you put
$100 in a bank account paying 4.5% interest, you know that by the end of the
year you will have received $4.50 in interest. You earned a 4.5% annual rate of
return. Rates of return are useful in investing because they work as a report
card to tell investors how well an investment is doing, no matter how much
they have invested. 
You can calculate rates of return yourself with the following: 
 A formula: Subtract an asset’s previous value from its current value and
divide the difference by the asset’s previous value and multiply by 100. 
If a stock rises from $15 a share to $32, you would calculate the rate of
return by first subtracting 15 from 32 to get 17. Next, divide 17 by 15 and
multiply by 100. The rate of return is 113.3%. 
 Financial calculators: You can use the Hewlett-Packard 12c that financial
types always carry. If you have this calculator, you can learn how to
crunch a rate of return with this easy-to-follow tutorial (www.hp.com/
calculators/training/cbt/12c_platinum.html). 
 Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet software: This software, which is avail-
able on most computers, calculates rates of return fairly easily. You can
find out how with the instructions at www.office.microsoft.com/
en-us/excel/HP011225061033.aspx. 
 Financial Web sites: Many handy sites can calculate rates of return for
you, including www.moneychimp.com/calculator/discount_rate_
calculator.htm. 
When you calculate the rate of return for a portfolio you’ve added money to
or taken money from, you must take an extra step. I explain how to do that in
Chapter 8.
The power of compounding
Famous physicist Albert Einstein once called compounding the most powerful
force in the universe. Compounding is when money you invest earns a return
and then that return also earns a return. (Dizzy yet?) When you leave money
invested for a long time, the power of compounding kicks in. 
Imagine you’ve deposited $100 in an account that pays 4.5% in interest a year.
In the first year, you’d earn $4.50 in interest, which brings your balance to
23
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

$104.50. But in the second year, you’d earn interest of $4.70. Why? Because
you’ve earned 4.5% on the $4.50 in interest you earned. The longer you’re
invested, the more time your money has to compound. 
You can enter your own information and see how powerful a force com-
pounding is here: www.dinkytown.net/java/CompoundSavings.html.
Compounding works on your side to fight against inflation and taxes.
Financial data and news provider Bloomberg has a Web-based calculator
(www.bloomberg.com/invest/calculators/returns.html) that tells
you whether your rate of return is putting you ahead.
Determining How Much You 
Can Expect to Profit
Why bother investing online? To make money, of course. But how much do
you want to make? Understanding what you can expect to earn is where you
need to start. Whenever you hear about an investment and what kinds of
returns it promises, you should be able to mentally compare it with the kinds
of returns you can expect from stocks, bonds, and other investments. That
way you know whether the returns you’re being promised are too good to 
be true. 
How do you do this? By relying on the hard work of academics who have
done some heavy lifting. Academics and market research firms have ranked
investments by how well they’ve done over the years. And I’m not just talking
a few years, but for decades — in many cases, going back to the 1920s and
earlier. The amount of work that’s gone into measuring historical rates of
returns is staggering, but if you’re using online resources, you’re just a click
away from finding out how most types of assets have done.
What you expect to earn is a number that will affect most of your investment
decisions, usually rather dramatically. The following table is a revised version
of Table 1-1 — the one that showed how five different people could expect to
save $1 million. Table 1-2 looks at how much they must save to make their goal
changes based on how much they think they will earn from their investments.

The 20-year-old must save nearly $500 a month extra if she thinks she will
earn only 5% a year from her investments instead of 15%. But even scarier, if
she saves $15.28 thinking she’ll earn 15% a year, but earns only 5%, she’ll
have just $30,963 instead of the $1 million she was counting on.
Studying the past
If someone asks you how stocks are doing, he often means how much they
went up or down that day. Financial TV stations reinforce this preoccupation
with the here-and-now by scrolling second-by-second moves in stock prices
across the bottom of the screen. 
But, second-by-second moves in stocks don’t really tell you much. If a stock
goes down a bit, and a company didn’t report news, did anything really
change during that second? Watching short-term movements of stock prices
doesn’t mean much in the overall scheme of things. 
To understand how investments behave, it’s more helpful to analyze their
movements over as many years as you can. That way, recessions are blended
with boom times to get you to a real, smooth average. Doing this requires the
painstaking method of processing dozens of annual returns of stocks and ana-
lyzing the data. Luckily, some academics and industry pioneers have done
much of the work for you, and you can access their findings if you know
where to look. And I just happen to know a few places where you can start
your search:
 Bogle Financial Market Research (www.vanguard.com/bogle_site/
bogle_home.html) is the Web site maintained by the founder of
Vanguard, John C. Bogle. Bogle revolutionized the investment industry
by creating the world’s largest index mutual fund, the Vanguard 500,
which is designed to mirror the performance of the stock market index.
25
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

Stock market indexes, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 and Dow Jones
industrial average, are benchmarks that let you track how the market is
doing.
Bogle’s site is invaluable because he explains that the market, on aver-
age, returns about 10% a year. That benchmark will be very important
later as you evaluate different stocks. Indexes are covered in more detail
in Chapter 8. 
 Russell’s Web site (www.russell.com) lets you look up how all types
of stocks, ranging from small to large in addition to bonds, have done
over the years. There’s a handy color-coded sheet that shows you how
they’ve all done every year since 1996 here: www.russell.com/
indexes/PDF/Styleperformance.pdf.
 Kenneth R. French’s Web site and Eugene Fama’s Web site (respectively)
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html
#HistBenchmarks
http://gsbportal.chicagogsb.edu/portal//server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_314_
215_0_43/http%3B/gsbportal.chicagogsb.edu/Facultycourse/Portlet/Faculty
Detail.aspx?&min_year=20064&max_year=20073&person_id=159486
These sites are complicated but worth the effort. French, a professor at
Dartmouth, along with University of Chicago’s Eugene Fama, revolution-
ized investing with an analysis that found three things that move stocks:
what the general market is doing, how big the company is, and how
pricey the shares are. Both keep statistics on their sites on how stocks
move. 
 Index Funds Advisors (www.ifa.com) compiles much of the research
done by Fama and French and helps explain it in plain language. You can
order a colorful book from the site, called Index Funds: The 12-Step
Program for Active Investors, by Mark T. Hebner (IFA). The book explains
how different types of stocks perform long term and how much you can
expect to gain. It also shows long-term returns of bonds. You can down-
load the book for free if you take the site’s Risk Capacity Survey,
explained later in this chapter.
 Robert Shiller’s Web site (www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller) contains
exhaustive data on how markets have done over the long term. You can
view the data and make your own conclusions. Shiller is a well-known
economics professor at Yale University.
 Standard & Poor’s Web site (www2.standardandpoors.com/
portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_500/2,3,2,2,0,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.html) contains a full record of the returns
from the Standard & Poor’s 500 index going back for decades. This is
invaluable data because you can understand how markets tend to move,
instead of worrying about things that have never happened. Go to the
Data tab to find the S&P 500 index historical returns. Open the Excel file
and scroll down the annual total returns page. You can get an idea of
26
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

how volatile stocks can be, but also what returns are possible if you stay
invested.
 MSN Money (http://moneycentral.msn.com) lets you download
the stock trading history of most investments. Figure 1-2 shows the long-
term gain of the S&P 500 index, provided by MSN Money. These steps
show you how to generate this kind of chart for any stock:
1. Enter the ticker symbol of the investment you’re interested and
click the Go button.
2. Click Historical under the Charts heading on the left side to
bring up the stock chart.
3. Click the Download the MSN Money Investment Toolbox link.
4. Select Download MSN Money Investment Toolbox. If you don’t
see the chart, install the ActiveX Control for the Investment
Toolbox. After installation, you should see a Download Complete
chart.
5. Proceed and click the I See Chart link, which pulls up the one-
year chart.
6. Select the All Dates option from the period down-down menu
option then select yearly.

If you have trouble installing the MSN Money Investment Toolbox, you can
get free help. From the front page of MSN Money, scroll down and click the
Help link at the very bottom-right corner of the page. A sidebar appears.
Type MSN Money Toolbox in the search field, click the green arrow, and then
click the MSN Money Investment Toolbox Doesn’t Install link.
Don’t get too hung up if you don’t understand everything on these sites.
Several get pretty sophisticated, especially Fama and French’s. Just scan
through the annual returns so you can get a general feel for how markets
behave over time — the idea here is for you to gain perspective, not cram for
an econ Ph.D.
What the past tells you about the future
Exhaustive studies of markets have shown us that stocks, in general, return
about 10% a year. Through the years, 10% returns have been the benchmark for
long-term performance, making it a good measuring stick for you and some-
thing to help you keep your bearings. But long-term studies of securities also
show that, to get higher returns, you usually must also accept more risk. Table
1-3 shows how investors must often accept more risk to get a higher return.

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that investing in stocks guarantees you a
10% return every year, like a savings account. That’s not the case. Stocks are
risky and tend to move in erratic patterns, and they test your confidence with
sudden drops. In fact, each year stocks typically posted somewhere between
a loss of 9% and a gain of 29.9%, according to IFA.com. And get this, since
1926, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has gained between 10.0% and 10.9%
only four times and returned 10% only once, in 1966. Don’t let short-term
swings in stocks derail your long-term plan. Be aware ahead of time of the
fact that markets move in violent ways. That way you won’t be tempted to do
something that you’ll regret later. Volatility is the price you must pay to get
returns.

Gut-Check Time: How Much 
Risk Can You Take?
It’s time to get a grip — a grip on how much you can invest, that is. Most
beginning investors are so interested in finding stocks that make them rich
overnight that they lose sight of risk. But academic studies show that risk and
return go hand in hand. That’s why you need to know how much risk you can
stomach before you start looking for investments and buying them online. 
29
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
Why knowing the past is valuable
By studying how investments have done, you get
an idea, on average, of what to expect. This
gives you perspective that lets you not only
decide whether an investment is worthwhile but
also gives you a B.S. meter. If you get a flyer in
the mail talking up a “promising new company”
that’s expected to generate 10% returns, walk
away. Why would you take a chance on a shaky
company if you can expect the same return by
investing in a lower-risk, diversified index fund?
Similarly, a return that’s much higher than 10%
must be much riskier, no matter what the flyer
says.

Several excellent online tools can help you get a handle on how much of a
financial thrill seeker you are. Most are structured like interviews that ask
you a number of questions and help you decide what kind of investor you
are. These are kind of like personality tests for your investment taste. I cover
several of these in more detail in Chapter 9, where I discuss how to create an
investing road map, called an asset allocation. For now, these questionnaires
are worthwhile to take right away so you can understand what kind of
investor you are. 
 Vanguard’s Investor Questionnaire (https://flagship.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/FundsInvQuestionnaire) asks you ten salient
questions to determine how much of a risk taker you are with your
money. It determines what your ideal asset allocation is. Take note of the
breakdown. The closer to 100% that Vanguard recommends you put in
stocks, the more risk-tolerant you are, and the closer to 100% in bonds,
the less risk-tolerant you are. 
 Index Funds Advisors Risk Capacity Survey (www.ifa.com/Survey
NET/index.aspx) offers a quick risk survey that will tell you what kind
of investor you are after answering just five questions. You can also find
a complete risk capacity survey that hits you with a few dozen ques-
tions. Whichever you choose, the survey will characterize what kind of
investor you are and even display a painting that portrays your risk 
tolerance. 
 SmartMoney Asset Allocator (www.smartmoney.com/oneasset)
couldn’t be much easier to use. You slide a variety of bars to indicate
your financial goals, ranging from your desire to leave money for heirs to
the number of years to retirement. The site will then give you a general
breakdown of where you should invest your money based on your risk
preference. 
Passive or Active? Deciding What 
Kind of Investor You Plan to Be
Investing might not seem controversial, but it shouldn’t surprise you that
anytime you’re talking about money, people have some strong opinions about
the right way to do things. The first way investors categorize themselves is
by whether they are passive or active. Because these two approaches are so
different, the following sections help you think about what they are and
which camp you see yourself in. Where you stand will not only affect which
broker is best for you, as discussed in Chapter 4, but also will affect which
chapters in this book appeal to you most.

How to know if you’re a passive investor
Passive investors don’t try to beat the stock market. They merely try to keep
up with it by owning all the stocks in an index. An index is a basket of stocks
that mirrors the market. Passive investors are happy matching the market’s
performance, knowing that they can boost their real returns with a few 
techniques I discuss in Chapter 9.
You know you’re a passive investor if you like the following ideas: 
 Not picking individual stocks: These investors buy large baskets of
stocks that mirror the performance of popular stock indexes like the
Dow Jones industrial average or Standard & Poor’s 500 so that they
don’t worry about whether a small upstart company they invested in
will release its new product on time and whether it will be well received. 
 Owning mutual and exchange-traded funds: Because passive investors
aren’t looking for the next Microsoft, they buy mutual and exchange-
traded funds that buy hundreds of stocks. (I cover mutual and exchange-
traded funds in more detail in Chapters 10 and 11, respectively.)
 Reducing taxes: Passive investors tend to buy investments and forget
about them until many years later when they need the money. This can
be lucrative because by holding onto diversified investments for a long
time and not selling them, passive investors can postpone when they
have to pay capital gains taxes. (I cover capital gains taxes in more
detail in Chapter 3.)
 Not stressing about stocks’ daily, monthly, or even annual movements:
Passive investors tend to buy index mutual funds and forget about them.
They don’t need to sit in front of financial TV shows, read magazines, or
worry about where stocks are moving. They’re invested for the long
term, and everything else is just noise to them. 
Sites for passive investors to start with
One of the toughest things about being a passive investor is sitting still
during a bull market when everyone else seems to be making more than you.
Yes, you might be able to turn off the TV, but inevitably you’ll bump into
someone who brags about his or her giant gains and laughs at you for being
satisfied with 10% market returns. 
When that happens, it’s even more important to stick with your philosophy.
Following the crowd at this moment will undermine the value of your strategy.
That’s why even passive investors are well served going to Web sites where
other passive investors congregate: 
31
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

 Diehards (www.diehards.org) is an electronic water cooler for fans of
Vanguard index funds and passive investors to meet, encourage, and
advise each other. They call themselves Bogleheads in honor of the
founder of Vanguard, John Bogle.
 Indextown (www.indextown.com) is a blog written for investors who
believe in the long-term success of buying mutual funds tied to indexes. 
 The Arithmetic of Active Management (www.stanford.edu/~wf
sharpe/art/active/active.htm) is a reprint of an article by an
early proponent of passive investing, William Sharpe, who explains why
active investing will never win. 
 Vanguard’s Web site (www.vanguard.com) contains many helpful stories
about the power of index investing and offers them for free, even if you
don’t have an account. 
 Mad Money Machine (www.madmoneymachine.com) is an Internet
radio show that tries to make the seemingly boring world of passive
investing more exciting. The host, Paul Douglas Boyer, weaves jokes,
music, and facts in a way to keep you investing passively. 
How to know if you’re an active investor
Active investors almost feel sorry for passive investors. Why would anyone
be satisfied just matching the stock market and not even try to do better?
Active investors feel that if you’re smart enough and willing to spend time
doing homework, you can exceed 10% annual returns. Active investors also
find investing to be thrilling, almost like a hobby. Some active investors try to
find undervalued stocks and hold them until they’re discovered by other
investors. Another class of active investors are short-term traders, who
bounce in and out of stocks trying to get quick gains. 
You’re an active investor if you . . .
 Think long-term averages of stocks are meaningless. Active investors
believe they can spot winning companies no one knows about yet, buy
their shares at just the right time, and sell them for a profit. 
 Are willing to spend large amounts of time searching for stocks. These
are the investors who sit in front of financial TV shows, analyze stocks
that look undervalued, and do all sorts of prospecting trying to find gems. 
 Believe they can hire mutual fund managers who can beat the market.
Some active investors think that there are certain talented mutual fund
managers out there and that if they just give their money to those 
managers, they’ll win. 
32
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

 Suspect certain types of stocks aren’t priced correctly and that many
investors make bad decisions. Active investors believe they can out-
smart the masses and routinely capitalize on the mistakes of the great
unwashed. 
 Understand the risks. Most active traders underperform index funds,
some without even realizing it. Before deciding to be an active trader, 
be sure to test out your skills with online simulations, as described in
Chapter 2, or make sure you’re measuring your performance correctly,
as described in Chapter 8. If you’re losing money picking stocks, stop
doing it. Be sure to know how dangerous active investing can be to 
your portfolio by reading a warning from the Securities and Exchange
Commission here: http://sec.gov/investor/pubs/online
tips.htm.
Many investors try, but very few are able to consistently beat the market.
Consider Bill Miller, portfolio manager for the Legg Mason Value Trust mutual
fund. Miller had beaten the market for 15 years and turned into a poster child
for active investors and proof that beating the market was possible if you
were smart enough. But even Miller’s streak came to an end in 2006. That’s
when his Legg Mason Value Trust fund didn’t just trail the market, it lagged
by a mile, returning just 5.9% while the market gained 15.8%. Active investors
lost their hero, but there will certainly be another hot manager to take his
place.
Sites for the active investor to start with
Ever hear of someone trying to learn a foreign language by moving to the
country and picking it up through “immersion”? The idea is that by just being
around the language, and through the necessity of buying food or finding the
restroom, they eventually get proficient. 
If you’re interested in active investing, you can do the same thing by hitting
Web sites that are common hangouts for active investors. By lurking on these
sites, you can pick up how these types of investors find stocks that interest
them and trade on them. These sites will show you the great pains active
investors go through in their attempt to beat the market. A few to start look-
ing at include the following: 
 Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) is the finance section
of this general purpose portal and a great resource for all investors. But
it contains several elements of particular interest to active investors,
such as the Investing Ideas section near the bottom of the page. Here
you can find stocks of interest to active investors for certain reasons.
33
Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing

The site also offers active chat rooms on almost every stock under the
Message Board heading on the left-hand side of the page. I talk about
chat rooms in more detail in Chapter 7. 
 TheStreet.com (www.thestreet.com) collects trading ideas and 
tips from writers mainly looking for quick moving stocks and other
investments. 
 TradingMarkets (www.tradingmarkets.com) explores the details of
complicated trading philosophies. The site highlights stocks that have
moved up or down by a large amount, which is usually something that
catches the attention of traders.

Getting Your PC Ready 
for Online Investing
In This Chapter
 Turning your PC into an online investing station
 Pinpointing online media that can make you a more informed investor
 Turning blogs and podcasts into research tools
 Practicing your techniques with online tutorials and simulations
 Scouring the Internet with search engines
 Securing your computer from online financial crooks
You live in a do-it-yourself world. You’re expected to fill your own gas tank
at the service station, refill your own soda at the fast-food restaurant,
and book your own airline tickets. It’s the same story with investing. If you
want to reach your financial goals and retire comfortably, it’s up to you to
make it happen. The age of employers looking after their workers’ futures
with pensions is vanishing and being replaced with do-it-yourself retirement
plans like 401(k)s. 
If you ask for help, you’re almost always pointed to the Internet and told to
look it up or do your own research. That sounds reasonable, except that the
Internet is a massive collection of Web pages, and you can find dozens if not
hundreds of sources for investing advice, much of which is conflicting or,
worse, wrong. No wonder many investors throw their hands up in utter 
frustration. 
That’s where this chapter comes in. In Chapter 1, I fill you in on what it takes
to prepare yourself to be an online investor. Here in Chapter 2, it’s time to
prepare your computer for online investing and make it a tool that quickly
provides you with the answers you need. This chapter helps you tweak your
computer until it’s like your personal investing workstation. It’ll feel as 
comfortable to you as an old leather chair. And by using mostly free online
resources, you’ll save yourself some money in the process.

I escort you through the morass of financial Web sites and show you which
ones you need to know. You find out what types of investing information are
available online and how to access what you need from your computer. You
also find out how to use online simulation sites that let you take a dry run
investing with fake money to make sure you know what you’re doing before
using real money. 
Turning Your PC into a Trading Station
When you think of a stock trading floor, you probably picture a room full of
traders wearing brightly colored jackets throwing papers around and yelling
out market orders. Some of that drama still exists on the New York Stock
Exchange floor and in the Chicago futures markets, but it’s largely a throw-
back from the old days. 
Today, trading floors I’ve walked through look more like insurance offices.
They have rows of desks with computers not unlike the one that’s probably
sitting on your desk. Professional traders do have an advantage: Many have
high-end trading systems and software that costs thousands of dollars a
month. That might be beyond your price range, but you might be amazed at
how much market information you can get, for free or for little money, if you
know where to go. 
Using favorites to put data 
at your fingertips
The easiest way to turn your computer into a market monitoring station is by
bookmarking or creating favorites to key sites with data you need. Favorites
(also sometimes called bookmarks) are links in your Internet browser that let
you quickly reach a Web page when you need it, without typing a long Web
site address. Most Internet browsers have this capability, and they all work
slightly differently. But just so you have an idea, if you’re using Microsoft’s
Internet Explorer 7, you can create favorites by doing the following: 
1. Navigate to the Web site you’re interested in saving.
2. Click the Favorites icon (the little gold star with the plus sign) in the
upper-left corner of the screen. 
You can see the star in Figure 2-1. 
3. Choose Add to Favorites. 
An Add a Favorite dialog box pops up.
36
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

4. Give the site a name you can remember.
Most sites will do this for you. 
5. In the Create In space, choose the Favorite folder you want to put the
Favorite into. 
If you want to put this Favorite in a separate folder, you can create a
folder by clicking the New Folder button. If you’re not sure, just use the
default Favorite folder. 
6. Click the Add button.
If you want to access that address again, click the Favorites Center icon (the
little gold star without the plus sign) and scroll down until you see the title 
of the page you’re interested in.
Compiling a list of must-watch sites
So you know how to create favorites. But what sites are worth creating as
favorites? My suggestion is to take a page from the professionals and try 
to replicate the data they’re most interested in. Most professional trading
workstations are set up so that they can take on five distinct tasks:

 Executing trades
Create separate favorite folders for all five functions and then fill them up
with the sites I recommend in the rest of this chapter.
Tracking the Market’s Every Move
You’re probably hoping to study the market and find ways to score big and
fast. Hey, everyone wants to get rich quick. Just remember that making money
by darting in and out of stocks is extremely tough to do, and most investors,
online or not, will be better off forming a long-term investment strategy and
sticking with it. The difference between long-term investing (the in-it-for-the-
long-haul approach, called passive investing) and short-term trading (the 
darting-in-and-out way of doing things, called active investing) is discussed in
Chapter 1, where I also give you the tools necessary for figuring out how to
decide which approach is best for you.
No matter what kind of investor you plan to be, watching real-time stock
movements is fascinating. Watching rapid price moves with stock prices
dancing around and flashing on the computer screen is a guilty pleasure and
a source of entertainment for some investors. 
You can find a great deal of overlap among online investing resources. Many
of the following sites do more than what I highlight here. Explore the different
sites and see whether certain ones suit you best.
There’s no shortage of places where you can get stock quotes and see the
value of popular market indexes such as the Dow Jones industrial average,
Standard & Poor’s 500, and NASDAQ composite index. That’s why you can
afford to demand more from Web sites if they’re going to earn a position as
one of your favorites. In Chapter 6, I list multiple sites best suited for tracking
specific parts of the market. But the next section has a quick list that can
help you get started creating general purpose online investing favorites. The
sites listed here make the cut because they not only provide stock quotes,
but also go a step further by being the best at a certain aspect of tracking 
the market.
38
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

When you look up a stock quote on many sites, you’ll usually see three quotes:
the last sale, the bid, and the ask. The last sale is what you probably think of
as the quote and is what runs in newspaper listings and on Web sites. That’s
the price at which a buyer and seller agreed to a transaction. The bid, though,
is the highest price other investors are willing to pay for the stock. The ask is
the lowest price investors who own the stock are willing to sell it for. 
Getting price quotes on 
markets and stocks
Nearly any site will give you stock quotes for the day, including the financial
news Web sites discussed later in this chapter. But a few sites deserve special
mention because they make it easy to get stock quotes for days in the past.
And because they deserve special mention, they’re getting it right here:
 MSN Money (www.moneycentral.msn.com/investor/home.asp) is
one of the best sites on the Web for online investing information and will
be mentioned several times in the book. For looking up prices of stocks
and market indexes, it’s hard to beat because it’s fast and gives you
everything you need, ranging from the stock’s closing price to how much
trading activity there was to when dividends (cash payments) were paid
to investors. You can also see how the stock moved each minute of the
day in real time, which is unusual for consumer stock sites. Most finan-
cial Web sites let you get quotes only on a 15-minute delay. And if you
don’t know the stock’s ticker symbol, MSN Money lets you look it up
quickly by using the symbol lookup feature. 
As part of the quote pages, you also see how the stock rates on MSN
Money’s StockScouter rating, with 10 being the best and 1 the worst. If
you click the full report, you can see all the things that go into the
rating, and you might discover a few things about the stock. 
One of the greatest strengths of MSN Money is that the site makes it
incredibly easy to download and analyze historical data. You can find
complete instructions on how to set up your computer in Chapter 1.
 Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) lets you download
historical data, too. Enter a stock symbol and click the Get Quotes
button. Then, in the left column, click the Historical Prices link. You will
see a page with a table of dates and the stock’s prices on those dates. In
the Set Date Range area near the top, you can pick a range of dates you’d
like stock prices for. Below the table (scroll down a bit) is a link to
Download to Spreadsheet.
 DownloadQuotes (www.downloadquotes.com) lets you download the
end of day values of dozens of U.S. and foreign market indexes as well as
individual stocks. Many of the site’s areas are free.

Slicing and dicing the markets
Although quite a few market indexes exist — I discuss many of them in
Chapter 8 — there are some major market benchmarks all online investors
need to be familiar with. These are the ones so commonly discussed that
they need to be part of your investor vocabulary. Table 2-1 presents them in
all their market-dominating glory:
Table 2-1
Key Market Indexes
Index Name 
What It Measures
Dow Jones industrial Average
Thirty big, industrial companies. When investors
hear about “the market,” more often than not
they think of the Dow. 
Standard & Poor’s 500
Big companies, including 500 of the nation’s
most well-known stocks. Moves very similarly to
the Dow, even though it includes more stocks.
NASDAQ Composite Index
Stocks that trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
It tends to closely track technology stocks.
40
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Knowing your exchanges 
When you get a stock quote from most Web
sites, you also see what exchange the stock
trades on. This is important information. Most
stocks typically trade on one of three major
exchanges in the U.S.: the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ, and the Ameri-
can Stock Exchange. The NYSE and the NASDAQ
are by far the largest and are the exchanges for
the biggest companies in the world. 
There are other places where stocks trade,
besides the NYSE and NASDAQ. There are for-
eign exchanges (which I cover in more detail 
in Bonus Chapter 1 on the Web) and informal
marketplaces such as the Pink Sheets and OTC
Bulletin Board. Many beginning online investors
are attracted to the Pink Sheets and Bulletin
Board stocks due to their low share prices and
high volatility, which is why they’re called penny
stocks or microcap stocks. But buying stocks on
the Pink Sheets and Bulletin Board can be very
risky. The Pink Sheets and Bulletin Board don’t
have the same oversight of their stocks, making
them popular with fraudsters. You can read the
Securities and Exchange Commission warnings
to investors about these stocks here: www.
sec.gov/investor/pubs/microcap
stock.htm.

Index Name 
What It Measures
DJ Wilshire 5000
The entire stock market. Contains all significant
stocks from the largest to the smallest.
Russell 2000
Small-company stocks. Tends to be more volatile
than indexes that track large companies — the
S&P 500, for example.
Nearly all financial Web sites let you track all the indexes listed in the table.
Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com), though, makes it easy to
monitor how different slices of the markets are doing, such as foreign stocks,
specific industry sectors and bonds. The Yahoo! Finance Web site offers a
couple of different ways for you to dig beyond the market indexes, as the 
following list makes clear:
 Get a quick read on all U.S. market indexes. To see how all the key U.S.
market indexes are doing, click the View More Indices link on the left
side of the page under the Market Summary heading. You can then see
many market indexes by clicking the different tabs, such as Dow Jones,
NASDAQ, and S&P under the Major U.S. Indices heading. 
 Get a run-down of how foreign stocks are doing. If you click the View
More Indices link and then click the World link on the left side, you can
monitor just about any foreign market you’d care to track. Bonus
Chapter 1 on the Web tells you more about investing in international
stocks.
 Get a summary of industry performances. Back on the main Yahoo!
Finance page, hover your cursor over the Investing tab and click the
Industries link. When the Industry Center page appears, click the link for
the industry you’re interested in. 
Yahoo! Finance makes tracking market indexes easy so you don’t have to
memorize or look up cryptic codes for indexes. You can find more tips about
industries in Chapter 6.
Don’t confuse stocks with indexes. Stocks are shares in individual companies,
such as General Electric or Exxon Mobil. The prices of stocks reflect how
much you would have to pay for a share of the stock. Indexes, on the other
hand, are mathematical formulas that tell you how much a collection of
stocks have changed in value. When the Dow Jones industrial average, which
contains 30 stocks, hits 13,000, that doesn’t mean you can buy it for $13,000.
It’s just a number that represents relative value. 
41
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

Your crystal ball: Predicting 
how the day will begin
Some investors like to get a jump start on the trading day by watching the
futures market. The futures market is an auction for future contracts, which
are financial obligations allowing their buyers and sellers to lock in prices 
for commodities and other assets in the future. The futures market allows
investors to bet how much certain assets will be worth minutes, day, weeks,
or years from today. Futures are commonly used with commodities, such as
energy and food, as described in more detail in Chapter 6. 
You can see what the futures market is saying about stocks, too. Financial
news and data company Bloomberg gives investors a sneak peak on 
how stocks could open the next trading day. On its Futures page (www.
bloomberg.com/markets/stocks/futures.html), you can see how
traders who apparently don’t have anything better to do are betting after the
stock market is closed how major market indexes around the world will open.
If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t like surprises, it’s an easy way to see
how investors are behaving even when the market centers are closed. 
Getting company descriptions
Professional investors like to bone up on what a company does, who’s in
charge, and how profitable it is without pouring through dozens of industry
reports. You can get the same kind of quick snapshot information with online
company descriptions. All the main investing sites I discuss have sections
that describe the business a company is in. Here are a couple more sites
worth checking out: 
42
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
How the Dow’s value is calculated 
Market indexes, such as the Dow, are priced
not by traders, but by calculators. Mathematical
formulas analyze the movements of the stocks
contained inside an index to arrive at the value
of the index. To get the value of the Dow, for
instance, the prices of the 30 stocks in the indexes
are multiplied by a divisor and added together.
The divisor is used to smooth out interruptions
that would be caused if stocks were replaced in
the index for different reasons. (You can always
look up the divisor of the Dow here: www.
djindexes.com/mdsidx/index.cfm?
event=showAvgOverview&average
Selection=G.) You can read more about
indexes in Chapter 8. 

 BusinessWeek: (www.businessweek.com) This site, which I discuss at
more length later in this chapter, offers in-depth profiles on companies.
Just enter the stock’s ticker symbol in the Stock Lookup text box — 
nestled under the Market Info heading — and you can find all the vital
information about the company ranging from the names of its manage-
ment to a description of what it does. You can also see a comprehensive
tear sheet of company information based on data from S&P’s high-end
system called Capital IQ. 
 Hoovers: (www.hoovers.com) Enter a company name, and you’ll 
not only find out just about everything you’d need to know about the
company, but also a detailed history. You can find hundreds of industry
profiles that give you a view of the competitive landscape the company
finds itself in. Some of the features on the site are free, but for others
you must subscribe. 
Keeping tabs on commodities
I have more on the exciting world of commodities — such as the oil, lumber,
and coal that companies use to make their products — in Chapter 6, but if
you can’t wait until then, check out the following Web sites:
 Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/
cfutures.html) has a professional-grade site that lets you watch
movements in just about any commodity that you can imagine, including
gold, silver, and platinum. Interested in hog bellies? Yes, you can see 
the price. This data is necessary if you want to invest in commodities
directly. Still, even if you don’t buy or sell commodities, they’re good to
watch. For instance, if you own shares of Starbucks, wouldn’t you want
to know what the price of coffee is doing?
 Chicago Board of Trade (www.cbot.com) lists prices on many of 
the major commodities such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and ethanol. 
I describe this site (and commodities-centric sites) in more detail in
Chapter 6.
Tracking bonds and U.S. Treasuries
A bond is an IOU issued by a government, a company, or another borrower.
An owner of a bond is entitled to receive the borrowed funds when they’re
paid back by a certain time in the future at a predetermined interest rate.
Even if you have no interest in investing in bonds, you still should know what
rates are doing. After all, if you could invest in bonds issued by the Federal
43
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

government that come due in 30 years, called Treasury bonds, and get 9%
annual returns guaranteed, wouldn’t you be a bit less enthusiastic about a
risky stock that you think will return only 10%? The U.S. government sells
other Treasuries, including Treasury bills (T-bills) that generally come due in
a year or less and Treasury notes (T-notes) that come due in longer than a
year but in ten years or less. I provide more details in Chapter 6 on how bond
yields affect stock prices, but a few sites to start you out with include the 
following:
 Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html)
makes tracking bonds very easy. Bloomberg lets you, at a glance, see the
yields on just about any major bond or Treasury you can imagine.
 Federal Reserve Bank (www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/funds
rate.htm) is the online presence for “the Fed,” as it’s affectionately
called. The Fed is in charge of strongly influencing short-term interest
rates, including the federal funds rate. That’s typically the rate banks
lend money stored at the Fed to other banks overnight. No, you can’t
borrow at that rate, but it’s very important to watch this interest rate
because it affects long-term interest rates, which you can borrow at. You
can see what the federal funds rate has been at the Fed’s site, as shown
in Figure 2-2. Traders buy and sell long-term Treasuries and set interest
rates based in large part on where short-term rates are or where they’re
expected to be.

If you’d like to find out more about how the Fed affects the nation’s
money supply, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City maintains a 
useful and simple site on the topic — designed for teens and college 
students, but useful for any investor — at www.federalreserve
education.org/Fed101.
Monitoring Market-Moving News
Ever see a biotech stock skyrocket after the company announced a break-
through treatment? Tech stocks routinely jump in price on the debut of 
popular new gadgets or software. That’s the power of news — often called
market-moving news in this sort of case. Markets are constantly taking in and
digesting all sorts of developments and changes, both good and bad. And to
stay on top of these developments, you’ll want to set a few leading financial
news sites as favorites. The following sections explore the different kinds of
financial news sites in greater detail.
Financial Web sites
Many of the financial sites mentioned earlier in the chapter are also great
places to get market-moving news. Yahoo! Finance and MSN Money pick up
stories written by wire services on the markets and on individual stocks,
making them helpful resources. Bloomberg covers just about every type of
traditional investment you can imagine, thanks to its network of reporters.
Others I haven’t mentioned include the following: 
 Google News (http://news.google.com) has a business section 
that pulls in important financial stories in one place. Its best feature is
the ability to search for news based on very precise criteria, including
keywords, the date the story appeared, or the geographic location of 
the news. 
 Briefing.com (www.briefing.com) is similar to the kind of data 
services professional investors use to follow news. In fact, most of
Briefing.com’s service is for large traders and investors who pay for 
its platinum or trader services. Still, the site recently made some of its
content available, for free, to regular investors. Just click the Free
Content button in the box on the left side labeled Investor, as shown in
Figure 2-3. You can find running commentary on market-moving news
and events. Briefing.com’s market wrap-up is a great way to find out
what’s behind the market’s day-to-day swings so you can see how any
random event can have a big effect on stocks. 
45
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

 MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com) is a comprehensive site for all
the business news you’ll need. The site attempts to separate itself from
the competition, though, by providing columns from various financial
writers who opine about everything from companies’ accounting prac-
tices to technology. MarketWatch has an attractive feature that lets you
instruct it to e-mail you articles of interest. You can also have it send you
an e-mail if a stock moves by a certain amount.
 BigCharts.com (www.bigcharts.com) is a service of MarketWatch
dedicated to serving up graphical information about the markets. The
best aspect of the site is the set of BigReports lists that show you, at a
glance, what the biggest movers on Wall Street were that day in terms of
price or percentage price change. 
 MotleyFool (www.fool.com) has a little something for everyone.
There’s content for the active trader, including stock tips galore, as well
as tricks and techniques on how to deeply analyze companies’ financial
statements. Passive investors, though, will appreciate the more general
personal finance stories.
 Reuters (http://today.reuters.com/investing/defaultUS.
aspx) makes high-end systems used by many professional traders. And
it has put many of the same tools into your hands. If you enter a ticker
symbol under the Stocks and Mutual Funds heading, you can see advanced
statistics about the stock, including things like dividend yields and key
ratios. (Don’t worry. I cover all this advanced stuff in Chapters 14 and 15.)

Many financial Web sites and news stories use the terms bullish and bearish.
When investors are bullish, they think the stock market is going to go up. And
when investors are bearish, they think stocks will go down.
Traditional financial news sites
Many of the financial news providers you might already be familiar with from
newspapers, magazines, and TV also provide data useful to investors online,
including the following:
47
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing
Do you speak ticker symbol?
Nearly every financial Web site is centered on the ticker symbol. These are the two-, three-, or
four-letter abbreviations used to symbolize stocks or investments. Originally, ticker symbols were
used so brokers could quickly read a ticker tape, a scrolling printout of stocks and prices. But the
symbol has taken on a new use in the online era, so much so that most sites have an empty text box
at the top where you enter the symbol first, click a button and then get sent to another part of the
site where you’re handed all the information pertaining to that stock on a silver platter. 
Ticker symbols have become so popular that investors sometimes use them instead of a company’s
name. And sometimes companies have fun with their symbols to make them more memorable. In
2006, for instance, motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson changed its symbol from the boring HDI to
the more exciting HOG, the nickname for its rumbling bikes. Other fun ticker symbols include:
Ticker 
Company
BUD
Anheuser-Busch
CAKE
Cheesecake Factory
HOT
Starwood Hotels
LUV
Southwest Airlines
SHOE
Shoe Pavilion
WOOF
VCA Antech (a veterinary company) 
SAM
Boston Beer
There’s one other thing to keep in mind regarding stock symbols. You used to be able to tell whether
a stock traded on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange just by looking at the symbol. For
many years, NASDAQ stocks traded with a symbol with four letters, such as INTC for Intel and
MSFT for Microsoft. But that changed in 2007 when NASDAQ began issuing symbols of one, two,
and three letters to its member companies. Delta Financial was the first NASDAQ stock to have
three letters, with its symbol DFS.

 USA TODAY’s Money section (http://money.usatoday.com) at
USATODAY.com delivers the business news that affects you (disclosure:
I’m a full-time reporter at USA TODAY). You can find not only the break-
ing news stories from wire services, but also enterprise stories you
won’t find anywhere else on beats ranging from markets to business
travel and cars. You can find extensive personal finance and mutual fund
coverage. And if you have any specific investing questions, check out my
online column, Ask Matt, where you can e-mail me questions, and I’ll
publish the answer. You can read the answer to questions Ask Matt 
readers have asked at the archive here: www.usatoday.com/money/
perfi/columnist/krantz/index.htm.
The site also has an interesting stock-rating service. By entering a stock
ticker symbol, you can see how aggressive or conservative an invest-
ment in that stock would be according to the USA TODAY Stock Meter.
Figure 2-4 shows the Stock Meter rating for General Electric.
 The Wall Street Journal Online (www.wsj.com) is a source of breaking
financial news. You might be familiar with the print edition of the Wall
Street Journal; this is the online version. This site charges for much of
its content.

 Financial Times (www.FT.com) is a London-based business publication,
so it provides a unique spin on business events here. It’s a good source
of merger announcements. 
 CNBC (www.cnbc.com) updated its Web site in 2006, and now the finan-
cial TV channel’s online presence offers many of the same things as
other financial news sites. What makes it unique is that it lets you view
segments that aired on CNBC that you might have missed. The segments
are streamed in your browser, saving you the trouble of having to be in
front of your TV.
 BusinessWeek.com (www.businessweek.com) is a stand-out site for
investors, largely due to the fact that it’s owned by McGraw-Hill, which
also owns Standard & Poor’s. The site offers some truly professional-
level tools that are worth your while. On the Investing tab, you can find
an interesting feature called the Interactive Stock Report. (You probably
have to scroll down to find it.) This feature steps you through the details
of an S&P stock research report on a certain stock each week. 
 CNN Money (http://cnn.money.com) has a good mix of breaking
financial news and general personal financial help. It contains specialized
information on markets, technology, jobs, personal finance, and real
estate. 
 Investor’s Business Daily (www.investors.com) is largely geared for
active investors and allows subscribers to read the next day’s paper early.
The site also has tools to help you find stocks that are outperforming the
rest of the stock market. 
 Barron’s (www.barrons.com) is a weekly publication written mainly
for more advanced investors. Most of the features are available only to
subscribers. Subscribers to the Wall Street Journal’s Web site get a cut
on Barron’s online site because both are owned by Dow Jones.
Checking In on Wall Street Chatter
Rumor and innuendo are key parts to traders’ lives. Because stock prices 
are highly sensitive in the short run to what other traders and investors are
saying about a stock, traders make it their business to follow any murmur. As
an individual investor, you’re somewhat at a disadvantage in this department
because you don’t have portfolio managers of giant mutual funds calling you
and telling you what they’re hearing. But you can use chat rooms, which I
cover in more detail in Chapter 7, or online blogs and podcasts if you’re 
interested in the scuttlebutt.
If you’re a passive investor, you probably couldn’t care less about rumors.
Even so, you can take advantage of blogs and chat rooms that are dedicated
to index investing. Just remember that these are casual and sometimes unre-
liable ways to keep up with the market chatter on various topics. 
49
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

Everyone is an expert: 
Checking in with blogs
Thanks to low-cost computers and Internet connections, just about anyone
with an opinion and a keyboard can profess their view of investments to the
world. Some of these opinions are worth listening to, but many are not. One
popular vehicle for sharing opinions is a blog (short for Web log), which is a
sort of online journal. Blogs can vary greatly in quality. Some are the modern-
day equivalent of a crazy person on the street corner yelling at anyone who
walks by, whereas other blogs are thoughtful and well-informed. It’s buyer
beware with blogs, and you have to decide whether the person is worth lis-
tening to. Ask yourself what the blogger’s track record is and how the blogger
makes money. 
Finding blogs
With so many blogs out there, sometimes the toughest part can be finding
them. Here are several ways that you can locate them: 
 General search engines: All the leading search engines, including
Google, Yahoo!, Live.com, and Ask.com, let you search much of the blog-
ging world. If it’s a major blog, you’re likely to find it just by searching
this way: Just enter the word investing in Ask.com, for instance, and you
can find general-interest finance blogs. Yahoo! Finance
50
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Beware of rumors
Investors can’t help themselves when it comes
to rumors. And sometimes certain blogs and pod-
casts only feed your innate desire to get the
inside scoop on an investment about to explode
in value. Investment rumors are kind of like
celebrity gossip: You’re probably better off ignor-
ing it, but sometimes it’s impossible to resist. Just
remember that making investment decisions
based on rumors is usually a very bad idea. 
Even giant stocks can get swept up in rumors
and result in pain for gullible investors. Here’s
an example: On June 8, 2007, U.S. Steel, one of
the world’s largest producers of steel, saw its
stock price soar 8% to $125.05. The move cre-
ated more than $1 billion in shareholder wealth
overnight. And it was all because of rumors and
speculation the company was going to be
bought. But investors that piled in were sorry
when it turned out the rumor wasn’t true. In the
following two trading days, the stock crumbled
more than 9%, erasing the entire gain, and then
some. 

(http://finance.yahoo.com) also has a directory of financial blogs
that makes the searching easier. Just enter a stock symbol and, when the
page for that particular stock appears, click the Financial Blogs link under
the News & Info heading on the left side of the page. (I discuss how to
turn search engines into your investment tools later in this chapter.)
 Blog search tools: Some search engines are tuned with the express pur-
pose of helping you locate blogs. One popular option is Google’s Blog
Search (http://blogsearch.google.com). Just enter investment
terms you’re interested in, and you get a list of the sites that meet your
criteria. Instant Bull (http://instantbull.com) keeps a list of popu-
lar financial blogs. You can access the list by clicking the Blogs link in
the top-left corner of the window. 
 Community sites: Sites such as MySpace (www.myspace.com) and
Windows Live Spaces (http://spaces.live.com) are best known as
places for musicians to promote their latest albums and for families to
share photos with each other. But some financial blogs are also lurking
on these community sites. To find them, just log into the site and search
for the words financial, money, investing, and stocks.
 Mainstream media: Almost all of the news sites have some of their writ-
ers penning blogs as well. Many blogs are available via Really Simple
Syndication, (RSS), which I explain in the later section, “Getting your
computer to do the work: RSS feeds.” 
Getting in tune with podcasts
Next time you see someone listening to an iPod or a Zune with earphone
cords dangling from his ears, don’t assume he’s rocking out. He might be
researching stocks or learning about investing. A podcast is an audio broad-
cast that’s transferred electronically over the Internet to your computer 
or MP3 player — they’re like radio shows for the Internet age. Like blogs,
podcasts are often done by amateurs, so the same need for caution applies.
But also like blogs, some podcasts are done by major media. 
Finding podcasts
It’s easy to find a radio or TV station: Just turn on the radio and start flipping.
But finding podcasts takes a little more doing. It’s not difficult, though, if you
try these different methods:
51
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

 Podcast search engines: Most of the major online search companies have
special online tools to help you pinpoint podcasts. AOL’s Search Podcast
(http://podcast.search.aol.com) lets you enter search terms and
then get a giant list of podcasts that meet your requirements. The Yahoo!
Podcasts search is available at http://podcasts.yahoo.com. Blubrry
(www.blubrry.com) is another popular podcast search site.
 Financial podcast search engines: StreetIQ (www.streetiq.com) is a
quick and easy place to go if you’re only looking for financial and invest-
ing podcasts. Not only can you search by topic, but you can enter a
ticker symbol and find out any podcast that has mentioned the invest-
ment you’re interested in.
 Podcast directories: Are the podcast search engines giving you too
many results? Try a podcast directory, which are online directories,
much like the Yellow Pages, where editors sort podcasts by subject area.
Podcast.net (www.podcast.net) keeps a comprehensive list of pod-
casts, including one on investment. Other directories worth looking into
include Podcast Alley (www.podcastalley.com) and Podcast.com
(http://podcast.com).
 Audio software: Apple’s iTunes software (www.apple.com/itunes),
for instance, has an excellent podcast search function as part of its
Tunes Store, which you can access from the Store link. Click the
Podcasts link and then click Business and you can scroll through hun-
dreds of available podcasts, including some from mainstream outlets
like BusinessWeek, CNBC and National Public Radio. Winamp (www.
winamp.com) and Yahoo! Music Jukebox (http://music.yahoo.com/
jukebox) can also help you find podcasts.
 Directly from the site: If you enjoy a Web site or blog, take a close look
because you might find that it offers podcasts. For instance, if you’ve
decided you want to be a passive investor (see Chapter 1) and enjoy
reading IFA.com, click the IFA iTunes Audio Podcasts link on the site’s
front page, and your iTunes software automatically displays a list of all
the site’s available podcasts. If you don’t have iTunes installed on your
computer, you’re prompted to install the software. In other cases, you
can click a Listen to This Podcast link of some kind directly from the
site’s page and download it or listen immediately without leaving your
browser.
Listening to podcasts
You can listen to most podcasts in three ways: 
52
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

 Listen on the site. 
You can listen to most podcasts by clicking a link, usually labeled Listen,
directly on the site.
 Download. 
Some podcasts let you click a Download button or, with Windows PCs,
right-click the Listen” link and download them. 
 Subscribe. 
You can install special software that will search your favorite podcasts
and automatically download new episodes when they’re available. An
option for both Windows and Mac users is downloading and installing
Apple’s iTunes software (www.itunes.com). iTunes handles all aspects
of listening to podcasts, ranging from finding podcasts to subscribing 
to them so that they’re automatically downloaded to your computer.
Another choice is Yahoo! Music Jukebox (http://music.yahoo.com/
jukebox). 
Specialized podcasting software programs are also available. If you’re
running Windows on your computer, you can download and install Juice
(http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net) or Doppler (www.
dopplerradio.net). A Macintosh version of Juice is also available. 
Some podcasts let you download episodes using Really Simple Syndication,
(RSS) links. I explain how to do this in the next section.
Getting your computer to 
do the work: RSS feeds
If you want to read investing news, read blogs, or listen to podcasts, you can
use the Favorites feature of your Web browser to bookmark a bunch of the
sites I mention in this chapter and then methodically make your way down
your Favorites list at your leisure. But some savvy online investors don’t
have time for that, so they use something called Really Simple Syndication, or
RSS feeds. RSS feeds are kind of like notices sent out by some blogs, podcasts,
and news sites to let the world know that something new is available. If you
use RSS feeds, you subscribe to a news Web site, blog, or podcast, and the
news comes to you. 
It’s easy to get started. First you need to have a way to receive the RSS feeds.
There are three main ways to do this: 
53
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

 Install an RSS reader. An RSS reader lets you tell the computer what
Web sites you’d like to subscribe to., The RSS reader software then pulls
the feeds containing articles from all the different news sites you’ve
chosen and presents them all to you in one page. Because RSS readers
are software, the RSS articles the reader downloads are stored on your
hard drive so you can read them later, even if you’re not connected to
the Internet. 
FeedDemon (www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon) is one
example of an RSS reader. You can also find specialized RSS reader soft-
ware programs, such as Investor Vista (www.investorvista.com),
designed with the needs of online investors in mind. These types of read-
ers, including FeedDemon, are usually not free and can cost about $30.
 Subscribe to a Web-based RSS aggregator. An aggregator creates a
tailor-made page with all the RSS feeds you’ve requested. So, rather than
logging onto individual sites, you log onto this one site that has dutifully
pulled in all the RSS feeds you’ve subscribed to. A popular RSS aggrega-
tor is NewsGator Online (www.newsgator.com).
Some aggregators require you to be connected to the Internet to read
your RSS feeds. Google Reader (www.google.com/reader), however,
allows you to download some of the RSS content if you install the sepa-
rate Google Gears plug-in (http://gears.google.com). 
The biggest advantage of RSS aggregators is that they’re usually free. 
 Use your Web browser. If you’re like me, you like to install as little soft-
ware on your computer as you can get away with, and you don’t like
signing up for all kinds of Web services. If that describes you, you might
consider checking to see whether your Internet browser supports RSS.
The latest version of Internet Explorer, version 7, makes it pretty easy.
Go to the Web site you’d like to subscribe to and click the orange RSS
feed icon, usually located to the right of the home icon on the menu bar.
You see a list of all the available RSS feeds from the site, like the one in
Figure 2-5. Click the Subscribe to This Feed icon, which looks like a gold
star with a green plus sign. A dialog box pops up, letting you name the
feed and click Subscribe. After you subscribe, you just click the
Favorites Center icon (a gold star without a green plus sign) and select
the Feeds tab, and you see a list of all the updates that were pulled down
for you. You can download Internet Explorer here: www.microsoft.
com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx.
For more options, check the Yahoo! list of RSS readers and aggregators at 
http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Data_Formats/XML__eXtensible_
Markup_Language_/RSS/RSS_Readers_and_Aggregators
54
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

After you get your RSS software, Web-based reader, or browser set up, it’s
easy to start getting RSS feeds. Just navigate to your favorite investing sites
and look for links that say “RSS Feed” or “XML” and click them. Your reader,
aggregator, or browser then gives you instructions on how to subscribe. 
Keeping Tabs on the Regulators
Professional traders’ computers also keep close tabs on regulatory filings
from companies. Regulatory filings are often the best, if not the only, data
that investors get directly from a company. If companies make any significant
announcements, they’re required to notify the appropriate government
watchdogs, which in most cases is the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I cover these important documents and what they contain in more detail in
Chapter 12, but for now, it’s important for you to know how to monitor these
documents and quickly find them online. You can get regulatory filings online
through
Figure 2-5:

55
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

 The company’s Web site: Most provide a section with their complete
reports.
 Financial sites and portals: Most of the sites I list earlier in the chapter
provide links to the documents.
 Aggregation sites: These sites, such as EdgarScan (http://edgar
scan.pwcglobal.com/servlets/edgarscan), parse the filings 
from companies and make them easy to find and download for free. SEC
Info (www.secinfo.com) sorts all the regulatory filings into easy-to-
understand categories. There are also pay-for services, such as FreeEdgar
(http://freeedgar.com). It’s funny, I know, that a site called Free-
Edgar isn’t free. But it and other pay services go a step further and might
even send you an e-mail the second a company files a report. Depending
on your needs, those might be worth your money.
 Securities and Exchange Commission: (www.sec.gov) For most
investors, the free SEC site has as much info as any sane person would
ever want, and it isn’t too difficult to navigate, to boot.
In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission site is so easy to navigate
that I’m going to show you how to do it right now. To find company regula-
tory filings, follow these steps:
1. Point your Web browser to www.sec.gov.
The SEC site makes an appearance.
2. In the Filings and Forms (EDGAR) section, click the Search for
Company Filings link.
The Search the EDGAR Database page appears.
3. On the Search the EDGAR Database page, under the General Purpose
Searches, click the Companies & Other Filers link.
The EDGAR Company Search page appears.
4. Enter the company’s name or ticker symbol into the appropriate box
and then click the Find Companies button.
There’s no need to do anything with the Ownership Forms radio buttons,
so you can leave them set on the default. 
You see a giant list of company filings in the order they were filed, as
shown in Figure 2-6.
It’s an intimidating list that’s hardly user-friendly because the forms are
distinguished only by their form, which is regulatory code for the types
of information the documents contain. Table 2-2 gives you the skinny on
what the various form codes mean. I don’t include all the form codes
because there are so many. Several of the form codes are for documents
you either don’t need to worry about or can get the data more easily
elsewhere, including when officers of the company sell stock.

Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

Table 2-2
SEC Forms You Can Use
Form Code 
What It Contains
8-K
A news flash from the company. 8-Ks can contain just about any-
thing that’s considered “material” or important to investors, ranging
from the resignation of a top official to news of the win of a new
customer. 
10-Q
The company’s quarterly report. This form displays all the informa-
tion a company is required to provide to investors each quarter. You
can find the key financial statements, such as the income statement
and balance sheet, which are covered in more detail in Chapter 12. 
10-K
The company’s year-end report. This is one of the most important
documents a company creates. It gives you a summary of every-
thing that happened during the year, including comments from
management and financial statements that have been checked, or
audited, by the company’s accounting firm. 
DEF 14 and 
The company’s proxy statement. Contains all the important 
DEF 14A
company information that’s subject to shareholder approval and
scrutiny. Most proxies contain everything that’s up for a vote at
the shareholder meeting, ranging from board members up for
election, pay packages and other perks, and pending lawsuits. If
you’re going to read any document, it’s this one.

Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

Companies don’t make their regulatory filings easy to read. You have to be
part lawyer, part investor, and part investment banker to read between the
lines in these often cryptic statements. I cover the basics in Chapter 12 and
teach you how to pick apart 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and DEF 14s. But other online
resources can help, including 
 Footnoted.org (www.footnoted.org), a business blog which studies
proxies and pinpoints things that smell fishy. 
 The AAO Weblog (www.accountingobserver.com/blog), which is
published by well-known accounting watchdog, Jack Ciesielski, who is
trained to find suspicious things in company filings. 
 Major mainstream media also pick the proxy statements apart and find
things that stand out. USA TODAY, for instance, analyzed proxy state-
ments for 2006 for an article you can find at www.usatoday.com/
money/companies/2007-04-16-ceo-compensation-usat_N.htm.
Executing Trades
With all this talk about researching and analyzing, don’t forget what job No. 1
is: buying or selling investments. You need to either log onto the Web site of
your broker or download special software from your brokers that will handle
the trades. I go over the dizzying number of choices you have for online 
brokers in Chapter 4. 
Searching the Internet High and Low
If you’re not able to find what you’re looking for by using the tips and tech-
niques in the preceding sections, it might be time to hit the main Web search
engines. Some of the most popular search engines include 
 Google: (www.google.com) Definitely the biggest and most popular
Web search engine; so much so that investors often say they’ll google a
stock. Because the site is so clean and Zen-like, it has the benefit of
being very easy to use.
 Live.com: (www.live.com) Microsoft’s attempt to come up with a
Google killer, Live.com has a few advantages for online investors, includ-
ing the ability to tailor the Web site to your tastes. 
 Yahoo!: (www.yahoo.com) Yahoo! is a good place for investors to
search because it has two types of searches: keyword and directory. As
58
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

with Google and Live.com, you can enter so-called keywords to search
for. But if you’re not quite sure what the right keywords are, look at the
tabs above the Search text box and find the More menu there. Click the
More menu, choose the Directory option, and then watch in amazement
as the entire World Wide Web is put into categories for you. From there,
you can drill down in search of what you’re looking for. For instance,
click the Business and Economy category and the directory will help
you find blogs and other business resources. There’s also a Finance and
Investment category that pinpoints sites on precise topics ranging from
brokerages to bonds and initial public offerings. 
 Ask: (www.ask.com) I guess when you’re #2 in your category — or #4 or
#7 or #17 — you do try harder. Ask.com has been trying hard to steal
traffic from the bigger search engines with different whistles and bells.

Keeping the Bad Guys 
Out: Securing Your PC
If you’re going to use your computer to process your investing and banking
tasks, you’d better lock it down. Cyber criminals have gotten sophisticated
and have targeted online investors in hopes of gaining control of a person’s
account and stealing money. 
Please, don’t let such concerns scare you off from investing online. After all,
cars get broken into, and you still drive. It’s just that you must take certain
precautions to make it harder for the bad guys to get into your PC, such as 
 Installing antivirus software: If a sinister code designed to wreak havoc
on your computer gets on your machine, it can be a real hassle. Viruses
can corrupt system files and make your computer unreliable or unus-
able. Antivirus software is the easy solution. It runs in the background
and looks at any program that tries to run on your computer and stops
the program if it tries to do something improper. 
Many antivirus software programs are available, including
• Commercial: Antivirus programs from McAfee (www.mcafee.com),
Symantec (www.symantec.com), and TrendMicro (http://us.
trendmicro.com) are popular. But these will cost you. 
• Free versions: Another option is to download and install a free
antivirus software program, such as AVG Free (http://free.
grisoft.com). 
59
Chapter 2: Getting Your PC Ready for Online Investing

 Installing antispyware software: Spyware is software that attaches itself
to your computer without your permission and runs behind the scenes.
It’s especially sinister because it might forward personal information to
a third-party, usually for marketing purposes. AVG (http://free.
grisoft.com) offers free Anti-Spyware software, but countless others
are available. Just search for the word spyware at Download.com (www.
download.com) and see which ones work for you. Many are free.
 Using firewalls: A firewall is an electronic barrier that (selectively) 
separates you from the Internet at large. A proper firewall is like a moat
around a castle — only traffic that you lower the drawbridge for can 
get in. 
• Built-in: If you have Microsoft Vista, you have a firewall turned on
by default. Windows XP has a built-in firewall, too, but you have to
make the extra effort and turn it on. Just call up the Run dialog box
(choose Start➪Run), type Firewall.cpl, click OK, click the General
tab in the dialog box that appears, and then select the On (recom-
mended) option. 
• Router: The other way to protect your computer with a firewall is
to install a router. A router is a small box that sits between your
computer and the wall jack that connects you to the Internet. Many
routers work like a software firewall and can even make your com-
puter invisible to other computers. Depending on your router, you
might need to enable the firewall. Check the router’s instructions
to find out how.
• Third-party software: A number of companies make firewall soft-
ware, some of which is free. ZoneAlarm Pro (www.zonealarm.
com) is one option, which costs $30. Comodo Free Firewall (www.
personalfirewall.comodo.com), you guessed it, is free.
 Installing all-in-one security: If the idea of installing three different
levels of security (antivirus/antispyware/firewall) seems complicated,
check out the available all-in-one answers. Microsoft offers Windows
Live OneCare (http://onecare.live.com), and Symantec has
Norton 360 (www.symantec.com/norton360).
Mastering the Basics with Online
Tutorials and Simulations
Online investing is like Vegas in that there are no do-overs. If you invest all
your money in a speculative company that goes belly up, you lose your
money. Period. Don’t expect the government to bail you out and don’t think
you can sue the company to get your money back. It’s gone. That’s why if
you’re new to investing, you might want to try the tutorials and simulations I
discuss in the following sections before using real money. 
60

Online tutorials
Before you jump into any risky activity, it’s worthwhile to take a deep breath,
relax, and make absolutely sure you understand how the process works.
Several excellent online tutorials can step you through the process ahead of
time to make sure you know what to expect. If you’re just starting out, it’s not
a bad idea to run through one of the following: 
 Investing Online Resource Center: (www.investingonline.org)
Here’s a site that all online investors should check out. It’s separated
into two halves: one part for beginners and one for more advanced
online investors. Beginning investors should take the quiz to measure
whether they’re ready for the real world of investing and then read
through the Eight Things You Should Know section. More advanced
investors should view the Real Cost of Daytrading tutorial that steps you
through the dangers of rapid-fire trading. 
 Investing 101 at Investopedia: (http://investopedia.com/
university/beginner) A great primer of what you can expect, it’s
worth running through to make sure you have all the basics down.

everything from getting started investing online to analyzing stocks —
something I cover in more detail in Chapter 13.
 The Investor’s Clearinghouse: (www.investoreducation.org) Here
you find links to online resources on all sorts of investing topics, ranging
from ways to research investments to finding investing help. An affiliated
site, Help For Investors.org (www.helpforinvestors.org), provides
even more tips.
 American Association of Individual Investors: (www.aaii.com) This

 Path to Investing: (www.pathtoinvesting.org) Here you can find
tutorials and calculators to help you make sure you know what you’re in
for when you start investing online.
Be careful about which online tutorials you read and pay attention to. Many
so-called tutorials are thinly guised pitches for investment professionals
trying to get you to hire them. Some also promote specialized trading tech-
niques with the purpose of getting you to buy books, video tapes, and other
materials.
Simulations
Online games, or simulations, let you buy and sell real stocks using only
funny money. Online simulations are a good idea for investors because they
let you get a taste for investing before you commit to a strategy.
A few simulators you can try out include
 Icarra (www.icarra.com) is a powerful portfolio tracking software 
program that’s so addictive, you might keep playing even after you set
up an online trading account and invest for real. As you enter buys and
sells, Icarra carefully tracks the performance of your stocks and tells
you how you’re doing. Even more interesting, though, is that you can
view other members’ portfolios and share your own. 
62

 Zacks’ Simulator (http://simulator.zacks.com/zacks/default.
aspx) lets you enter your buys and sells, and it ranks you against the
others playing the game. The site, shown in Figure 2-8, adds a bit of a
community feel by allowing the different people, who compete for a
prize purse of $100,000, to post blogs describing their strategies. 
 Investopedia Stock Simulator (http://simulator.investopedia.com) 
starts you with $100,000 in funny money and lets you invest in any way
you choose, including some advanced techniques I cover in Chapter 5.

An interesting feature about Icarra, the truly
addictive investment-simulator program, is that
investors can create portfolios that mirror
famous investors’ strategies and see how they
turn out. One member created a portfolio sus-
pected to be similar to that of Vanguard founder
Jack Bogle using press reports of his holdings.
You can also find portfolios in Icarra that mirror
the portfolio of Warren Buffett and those rec-
ommended by David Swensen, the successful
manager of Yale’s massive endowment fund.

 BullPoo.com (http://bullpoo.com) starts you with a virtual portfo-
lio of $1 million to invest. It’s similar to social networking investing sites,
discussed in Chapter 7, except that those track real trades.
 Marketocracy (www.marketocracy.com) has a free service called Run
A Fund that lets you pretend you’re a money manager. It tracks your 
performance and ranks your investing prowess.
 HedgeStop (www.hedgestop.com) starts you with $50 million in play
money and then lets you get to work investing. You can invest alone or
create a team with friends. Your results are tracked and ranked.

O
nline investors tend to be do-it-yourself types, so it’s unlikely that they’ll
have tax consultants on retainer just waiting to handle any tax issues
they might have. No, many online investors are big on going it alone, which
can be rewarding as long as such investors become tax-savvy, especially when
it comes to how taxes on the different accounts vary. 
In this chapter, I explain how investments are taxed and discuss ways in which
picking the right kind of account can cut your tax bill. You’ll want to understand
the differences between the three main types of accounts — taxable, retirement,
and education savings — before you sign up with an online broker. I also show
how online tools can help you track and reduce your taxes. Finally, I step you
through the different types of tax-advantaged accounts that can help you reach
long-term goals such as saving for your child’s college education or for your
retirement. 
Knowing How Different 
Accounts Are Taxed
Brokerage accounts might all seem the same; after all, they’re just holding
tanks for investments. Different types of brokerage accounts, though, look
very different to the government. Thanks to the unbelievable complexity of
the tax code, you can use three main types of accounts to hold your investments:
taxable, retirement, and education savings accounts.

Taxable accounts
Taxable accounts are the standard accounts that come to mind when you think
about investing online. Taxable accounts are very liquid, meaning you can
easily access the money without paying special penalties. But that flexibility
comes at a cost: taxes. When stocks you own in taxable accounts go up, or
appreciate, and you sell them, you owe capital gains taxes on your profit that
tax year. (Capital gains are gains you’ve made on the capital — cash — you’ve
invested. Pretty simple, huh?) And if the stocks issue you cash payments, or
dividends, you owe tax on those, too. I discuss how capital gains and dividends
are taxed in the section entitled “Plain Vanilla: The Taxable Brokerage
Account,” later in this chapter.
Retirement accounts
Retirement is one of the largest and most intimidating things you must save for. 
The bright side is that special retirement accounts make saving easier. It’s a good
thing, because company pensions are vanishing. That leaves retirement planning
up to you. I explain the different types of retirement plans available to most
people — and which ones could make the most sense for you — later in this
chapter. The key retirement accounts to be aware of are
 401(k)s are typically retirement plans sponsored by a company.
Oftentimes the company will match the employee’s contributions. 401(k)
plans allow you to delay when you must pay taxes on your contributions
and investment gains.
 Traditional individual retirement accounts or arrangements (IRAs) are
available to anyone below the age of 701⁄2 who earn enough money to
qualify and wants to delay when taxes are due on retirement savings.
Your contributions might also be tax deductible if you’re not covered by
a company retirement plan or don’t exceed income limits. You can look
up the current limits on the Internal Revenue Services’ Web site
(www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch01.html#d0e1025). 
 Roth IRAs are retirement savings accounts that let you put in money
that’s already been taxed so it can grow and never be taxed again.
 Other popular retirement plans include simplified employee pension
(SEP) accounts, 403(b) plans for employees of tax-exempt entities, and
Keogh plans, which each have different advantages and disadvantages. 
I cover IRA-like SEPs in more detail later in this chapter.
Check out the “Retirement Accounts: Knowing Your 401(k)s from Your IRAs”
section, later in this chapter, for more on your retirement plan options.

Education savings accounts
The cost of a college education keeps soaring. In 2007, the tuition and fees 
for a four-year public college degree cost $27,100, and a private college cost
and $103,000, says Savingforcollege.com (www.savingforcollege.com/
tutorial101/the_real_cost_of_higher_education.php), citing data
from The College Board. And it gets worse: Tuition prices go up faster each
year, 6% on average, than prices on almost anything else you’d buy, including
stamps, eggs, and milk. If you factor in the 6% annual rate at which tuition
fees are increasing, in 18 years the tab for a public college will hit $77,200,
and it’ll reach $294,100 for a private one. Online investors can get help from
two types of education savings accounts:
 529 plans are very financially attractive state-sponsored education savings
accounts. They can be used to shield money earmarked for college or to
prepay college tuition fees to lock in today’s price.
 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts are more restrictive than some
education savings accounts, but they have the huge benefit that the
money can be used to pay for elementary and secondary school as well. 
I explain the different types of education savings accounts and how you can
use online resources to maximize your tax savings in the “Going Back to
School with Education Savings Accounts” section, later in this chapter.
Plain Vanilla: The Taxable
Brokerage Account
If you want to talk intelligently about tax-advantaged accounts — accounts
that are sheltered in some way for some period or other from the Internal
Revenue Service — you would be well-served if you boned up on how regular
taxable accounts are handled. It’s hard to see why retirement accounts are
such a boon for investors if you have no idea to what extent investments are
usually taxed by Uncle Sam. 
I give you online tools to help you crunch the numbers, but first, it’s impor-
tant to understand the basics of how the taxes work. Commit these basics to
memory so you can think about any tax consequences before you place a
trade in a taxable account. Keep in mind that these are just the basics, and
the rules can change slightly for people in different situations. If taxes are
your primary concern with investing, consult with books on the topic or with
a tax professional. (I can, of course, recommend Taxes 2007 For Dummies, by
Eric Tyson, David Silverman, and Margaret Munro.)
67
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

You have a taxable event in a taxable brokerage account when one of two
things occurs: 
 Capital appreciation: Imagine that you hit a veritable investing home
run by buying a share of stock for $10 that soars to $100. When you sell
the stock, that $90 per share gain is called capital appreciation or a realized
capital gain. If you hold onto the stock and don’t sell it, it’s considered
an unrealized capital gain. And with an unrealized capital gain, because
you haven’t actually cashed in the stock, you haven’t profited in the
eyes of the government and don’t owe taxes. But the second you sell,
everything changes. Your gain turns into a taxable one subject to rules 
I discuss shortly. 
 Dividends: You probably remember dividends from the Chance card in the
Monopoly board game. Dividends are cash payments made by companies
when they’re making so much money they don’t know what to do with it.
The only thing they can think of is returning it to the shareholders. That
way, shareholders can reinvest the cash rather than it piling up in the
company’s bank account.
I show you how to find out how much cash a company has on hand in
Chapter 12, and in Chapter 13, I show you how to find stocks that pay fat
dividends. 
Capital appreciation is a fine thing to write about, and I do get to it eventually —
right after the next section, to be precise — but dividends have that Somebody-
Is-Sending-Me-Money-without-My-Really-Understanding-Why appeal, so I’m
going to dive right in and talk about them first.
The importance of dividends
Dividends usually won’t make you rich overnight, but don’t think they’re just
for widows and orphans. Dividends accounted for about one-third of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index 10% total return in its more than 50 years of exis-
tence. Total return measures your percentage gain on a stock resulting from
both stock-price gains and dividends.
If you’re not getting dividends, you could be missing out. Table 3-1 shows
what stocks in the S&P 500 have returned each year since 2000 and the per-
centage that came from dividends. You’ll notice dividends helped make up
for losses in years when stocks declined in value.

Dividends are paid based on how many shares you have. If a company
declares a $1 per share dividend, and you own 100 shares, you will receive
$100. To help compare the sizes of dividends, investors generally talk about
the dividend yield. A dividend yield tells you how much return you’re getting
in the form of a dividend; in other words, how big the dividend is relative to
what you’ve invested. 
You can calculate a stock’s dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend by
the stock’s price. But you can also get it from almost every financial Web site
explained in Chapter 2. Reuters, for example, has an extensive database of
dividend information. To get a company’s dividend yield, here’s what you do:
1. Go to Reuters’s Investing main page at
http://today.reuters.com/investing/defaultUS.aspx.
2. Scroll down to the Stocks & Mutual Funds section and enter a ticker
symbol in the Ticker Symbol field.
3. Click the Ratios link in the left column and click Go.
In the Dividends table, shown in Figure 3-1 using General Electric as an
example, you can see what a company’s dividend yield is now and what
it was on average over the past five years. You can also see what kind of
dividend yields other companies in the industry pay.

Some online brokers and companies that sell their shares to investors
directly allow you to use dividends paid by a stock to buy more shares of the
stock. These programs are called dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). If
you’re interested in these plans, keep them in mind when evaluating brokers,
as described in Chapter 4.

How capital gains are taxed
When you sell a stock held in a taxable account that has appreciated in value,
you usually have taxes to pay. Generally, such capital gains taxes, as they are
referred to, are calculated based on how long you owned the stock a period
of time known as the holding period. There are two holding periods:
 Short-term: That’s the type of capital gain you have if you sell a stock
after owning it for one year or less. You want to avoid these gains if you
can because you’re taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, which as I
explain shortly, is one of the highest tax percentages.
 Long-term: That’s the type of capital gain result if you sell a stock after
holding it for more than one year. These gains qualify for a special 
discount on taxes, as described a little later.
You must own a stock for over one year for it to be considered a long-term
capital gain. If you buy a stock on March 3, 2007 and sell it on March 3, 2008
for a profit, that is considered a short-term capital gain. Also, an important
thing to remember is that the holding period clock starts the day after you
buy the stock and stops the day you sell it. Selling even one day too soon can
be a costly mistake.
The high tax price of being short-term
If you’re interested in cutting your tax bill in a taxable account, you want to
reduce, as much as possible, the number of stocks you sell that you’ve
owned for only a year or less because they’re taxed at your ordinary income
tax levels. You can look up your ordinary income tax bracket from the
Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,
id=164272,00.html). But just to give you an idea, the tax brackets for 2007
are shown in Table 3-3.

Need an example? How about this one. Remember the stock I mention earlier
that went from $10 to $100 a share (for a $90 per share gain)? Say the investor
had $50,000 in taxable income that year and sold the stock after owning it for
just three months. The investor’s gain would fall from $90 to $67.50 after
paying $22.50 in taxes.
How long-term capital gains are taxed
By owning stocks for more than a year, gains are taxed at what’s known as the
maximum capital gain rate. The rate you pay on long-term capital gains varies
based on your normal tax bracket, but such rates are almost always much
lower than your ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains rates, though,
can change dramatically due to political pressure, as explained by financial Web
site Bankrate (www.bankrate.com/brm/itax/tips/20010305a.asp).
Table 3-4 shows the maximum capital gain rates for 2007 for typical invest-
ments such as stocks and bonds.

When you can win from your losses
If you’re like most investors, you beat yourself up anytime you sell a stock for
a loss. Nobody likes to lose money when the whole point of investing is to
make it. But if there’s a plus to suffering a loss, it comes at tax time. The IRS
allows you to use capital losses to offset your capital gains and possibly your
regular income. If your losses exceed your gains, you have a net capital loss
to report on Schedule D, which can even cut your taxable income each year.
This IRS rule presents several tax strategies that can cut your tax bill. The
guidelines, when it comes to using losses to cut your capital gains taxes,
include the following: 
 Use losses to avoid short-term gains. Make it your goal to never have a
short-term capital gain. If you sell a winning stock you’ve owned for a
year or less, go through your portfolio, find a loser and sell it. (You can
even use losses from stocks you’ve owned for more than a year to offset
short-term capital gains.) If your long-term loss is greater than your
short-term gain, the gain vanishes, and you have a net long-term loss
instead. You can deduct up to $3,000 ($1,500 if you’re married and file
separately) from your regular taxable income. Not a bad deal.
For example, imagine that you scored a $1,000 profit from a high-flying stock
you owned for a month. Normally, you’d have to pay $280 in taxes because
it’s a short-term gain. But you can pay no tax if you sell a stock at a loss
of $1,000 by the end of the tax year. You get the entire $1,000 from the
first sale, and you offload a bummer of a stock at the same time. Win-win!
 Dump your losers. If you have losing stocks in your portfolio that you’ve
lost hope in, sell them so you at least get a tax break. Tax rules allow you
to deduct up to $3,000 a year in capital losses from your regular income.
It’s a decent way to get out of a stock you’re tired of and cut your tax bill. 
 Don’t forget tax-loss carryovers. What if your net loss is greater than
the annual limit of $3,000? Do you lose the deduction? Not at all; you just
have to spread it out. You can carryover capital losses to your future tax
returns until you use them up. Edward Jones (www.edwardjones.com/
cgi/getHTML.cgi?page=/USA/resources/tax/transactions/
capital_gains.html) provides detailed information about how to
carry over capital losses. 
Don’t think you can sell a stock you’re losing money on, take the loss for tax
purposes, and just buy it back. The IRS’s “wash sale” rule prohibits this. If
you sell a stock or mutual fund for a loss, you’re not allowed to deduct the
loss if you bought that investment or one that’s “substantially identical”
within 30 days before or 30 days after the sale. To avoid triggering the wash
73
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

sale rule, you must wait 31 days after the sale to buy the investment back.
Here are two sites that can help you understand the complexities of the wash
sale rules:
 Fairmark (www.fairmark.com/capgain/wash) provides a detailed
description of wash sale rules and ways to avoid getting tripped up by
this tax trap. (See Figure 3-2.)
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov/answers/
wash.htm) also provides guidance on wash sales.
What to do with your worthless stock?
Selling your losers is usually pretty straightforward: You swallow your pride,
sell the stock, and take your tax loss. But sometimes it’s not that easy.
Periodically, companies crash so badly their stocks are delisted from the
exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, where they
traded when you bought them. This happened to both Enron and Delta Air
Lines. They become what’s called a worthless security.

You can still deduct the loss on a stock even if the shares aren’t available for
trading anymore. But the IRS is pretty clear about what you need to do. In most
cases, even when a stock is delisted, it still trades on informal markets such as
the Pink Sheets. It’s best to sell the stock there so you can recognize the loss
and have a paper trail. It’s often best to sell this way, even though some online
brokers charge slightly higher commissions because proving something is
worthless without being able to sell it can be difficult. If you can’t sell the stock,
you must prove it’s worth less than a penny per share. Additional rules say
that you can deduct your loss from a worthless stock only in the year it became
worthless. If you didn’t realize a stock wasn’t worth anything until the year
after it lost its value, you have to file an amended return for the year the
stock became worthless.
Using technology to measure 
your capital gain
Taxes can have a dramatic effect on your online investing success, so you
need to be aware of the rules. Most online brokerages won’t stop you from
placing a trade that could hurt you when tax time rolls around. It’s up to you
to manage your tax picture. And it’s also up to you to track your capital gains. 
You might think “Easier said than done,” but keeping track of your capital
gains isn’t that complicated. Essentially, if you know the following about all
your investment transactions, you have what you need to keep tabs on your
capital gains: 
 The date you bought the investment.
 The amount you paid to buy it, which is known as your cost basis.
You can calculate this by multiplying the stock price you paid times the
number of shares you bought and then adding the commission you paid
for the stock. All that added up together is your cost basis. 
For example, say you bought 100 shares of ABC for $50 and paid a $5
commission. Your basis is $5,005. You get that by multiplying the cost of
the stock with the number of shares ($50 times 100 shares) and then
adding the $5 commission.
 The date you sold the investment.
 The amount you received for selling it, or your proceeds. You can
calculate this by multiplying the stock price you sold at times the
number of shares you sold, minus the commission you had to pay.
Imagine now that you sold your 100 shares of ABC for $100 and paid a 
$5 commission. The amount of your proceeds is $9,995. You get that by
multiplying the price of the stock by the number of shares ($50 times
100 shares) and then subtracting the $5 commission.
75
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

At tax time, you must then report all your capital gains on Schedule D. For
more help on this, check out the current Taxes For Dummies book (Wiley
Publishing) or check out what the IRS says about sales and trades of invest-
ment at www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e9488. 
Because you’re an online investor, you’re probably loath to actually use a
pencil and paper to keep track of all this information. Luckily, you have
several alternatives:
 Personal finance software: These programs, including Microsoft Money
and Intuit’s Quicken (discussed at more length in Chapter 1), keep track
of everything you need to file Schedule D. Both can also transfer all the
data the government requires directly into tax-preparation software, such
as H&R Block’s TaxCut or Intuit’s TurboTax. Both software programs also
print out a capital gains worksheet you can give to your tax preparer. 
 Portfolio tracking sites: Several of the Web-based portfolio-monitoring
sites discussed in Chapter 8 can help you track everything you need to
calculate your taxes. ClearStation (http://clearstation.etrade.
com) can even help generate the tax form required by the IRS.

Pay no capital-gains taxes?
It almost seems too good to be true. Could it be the government is cutting the capital gains tax to 0%?
The answer is yes and no. Congress approved a bill that cut long-term capital gains taxes for many tax-
payers through 2010. And, between 2008 and 2010, the long-term capital gains rate for some investors
falls to nothing from 5%. The lower rate affects only long-term capital gains because short-term gains
are taxed at your ordinary income rate. 
Before you start writing a thank-you letter to the IRS, though, you should know that there are some
heavy restrictions. The 0% long-term tax rate applies only to people in the bottom two tax brack-
ets, which means in 2007 you’d have to have less than $31,850 in taxable income as a single person
or less than $63,700 for a married couple filing jointly to qualify. Those cutoffs will rise a little in 2008
to adjust for inflation. 
The following chart shows how much long-term capital gains taxes are scheduled to fall for those
who qualify:

 Online brokers’ Web sites: Such sites often track when you bought
investments, how much you paid, and when you sold them. Nearly all
online brokerages have a place on their Web sites where you can see
your realized and unrealized gains. And at the end of the year, most
online brokerages mail you a document showing all your trades and
your basis. 
 Online capital gains calculators and sites let you enter your stock buys
and sells and help calculate your net capital gains or losses and carry-
overs. SmartMoney.com offers a helpful calculator that does this (check
it out at (www.smartmoney.com/tax/capital/index.cfm?story=
capitalgains), as do MoneyChimp (www.moneychimp.com/
features/capgain.htm) and Quicken.com(www.quicken.com/
taxes/capgains).
 Specialized online sites dedicated to optimizing your tax strategy might
make sense if you have a particularly complicated situation. For instance,
GainsKeeper (www.gainskeeper.com) is a professional-level online 
service that helps you track your trades, tally your cost basis in stocks,
and find ways to reduce your taxes. (Figure 3-3 shows the GainsKeeper
site.) If you’re an extremely active trader, the tax rules and keeping track
of everything can get complicated, so software like this can be helpful.
The system isn’t free; it’ll cost you at least $70 a year. Before signing up,
though, check with your broker — some offer discounted subscriptions.

Measuring your capital gains 
if you’ve lost your records
I know you meticulously track all of your investments and trading records.
But in the off case you just can’t find how much you paid for a stock, you can
still figure out your basis by using the Internet as long as you know when you
bought it. You can use the historical charting, as described in Chapter 2, to look
back into time and see where the stock was trading the day you bought it. 
Here’s how:
1. Log in to MSN Money (http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor)
and enter the stock symbol in the Symbols text box on the main toolbar.
2. Click the Historical link under the Charts link.
3. Install the MSN Money Investment Toolbox software, as described in
Chapter 1. 
This software is easy to install. But if you don’t want to bother or can’t
get it to install, skip to the Tip icon immediately following these steps.
4. Select Custom from the Period pull-down menu at the top of the chart.
5. Enter the date you bought the stock in the From field and the date you
sold it on the To field; then choose the Daily option under Display
Detail and click OK.
6. Place you cursor on the first date in the chart, like the one you see in
Figure 3-4, and click.
At the top of the chart, you see the price the stock traded at the day you
bought it. Add the commission you paid to the stock price, and you have
your cost basis.
7. Place your cursor on the last date on the chart and click.
At the top of the chart, you see the price the stock traded the day you
sold it. 
8. Use the information and follow the previous instructions on how to
calculate your capital gain or loss. 
The data you got from MSN Money are also what you need to fill out
Schedule D.
If you’re unable to install MSN Money Investment Toolbox, follow Steps 1 and 2
in the preceding list. Then scroll down to the bottom-left side of the page and
enter the dates you bought and sold the stock under the Custom Date Range
heading. Drag your cursor to the left to get the stock price on the date you
bought the stock. Drag your cursor to the right to get the stock price on the
date you sold.

How dividends are taxed
Thanks to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, dividends
caught a big-time tax break. Dividends that meet certain criteria are considered
qualified and are taxed at the same favorable rate as long-term capital gains, as
discussed in the previous section. That was a huge break, because prior to that,
dividends were taxed at the typically much higher short-term capital gains rate.
But, to get the lower tax treatment, dividends must be
 Qualified: Dividends from most companies that trade on U.S. exchanges
are qualified. There are important exceptions, though, including some
dividends paid by real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, which typically
own commercial real estate such as apartment buildings and strip malls.
Also keep in mind that dividends paid by money market accounts and many
bond funds don’t qualify either because they’re considered interest.
The Fairmark.com Web site (www.fairmark.com/mutual/ordinary.
htm) has a set of tools that can help you decide what kinds of dividends
you have and how they’re taxed.
 Paid to a shareholder who holds the stock for the right amount of time:
To qualify for the lower rates, you must own the stock for a long enough
time. The IRS says you must own the stock more than 60 days during the
121-day period starting 60 days before the stock’s ex-dividend date. The
ex-dividend date is the day a new investor who bought the stock is no

longer entitled to dividend declared by the company. For more information
on this, Fidelity.com (http://personal.fidelity.com/planning/
tax/distributions/qdi.shtml.cvsr) has a section that explains 
qualified dividends. The Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.
gov/answers/dividen.htm) explains the ex-dividend date.
Investors who buy investments and hold them for a long time get a huge tax
advantage over short-term traders. By holding stocks, you can put off the time
when you have to pay tax on your gains. That allows your entire, untaxed ball
of cash to snowball tax deferred. But, even long-term investors have to pay
taxes on dividends each year. 
Retirement Accounts: Knowing
Your 401(k)s from Your IRAs

Until death do you part: Ownership 
of taxable accounts
When you set up an online brokerage account,
you’ll be asked whose name it should be put in.
This seemingly mundane question can have
serious tax consequences. Sorry to be morbid
here, but death is the event that makes the way
you possess an account very important. The fol-
lowing are the main types of accounts and how
each affects your tax situation in the event of
your (timely or untimely) demise: 
 Individual accounts are the common stan-
dard account. You are named the owner,
and on your death, the assets go to your
estate.
 Joint tenants with rights of survivorship
gives each owner an entire stake. That
means if one owner dies, the assets trans-
fer directly to the other owners.
 Tenants in common lets you slice up an
account, by percentage, among different
owners. When you die, your percentage of
ownership passes to your estate. 
 Community property is a method of owner-
ship available only in states that allow it.
This allows a married couple to equally own
assets. The Internal Revenue Service
(www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p555.
pdf) recognizes nine community property
states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,
and Wisconsin. Alaska residents can choose
to have community property treatment.

you buy or sell a stock (bad enough) and it also eats into your returns (even
worse). Being forced to pay taxes frequently means that the amount of capital
you can invest gets whittled away, hurting your ultimate performance. That’s
the beauty of retirement accounts. Just remember that the downside to
retirement accounts is you might get socked with penalties if you take
money out before you retire. 
In this section, I describe the main types of retirement accounts. The tax
rules are complex and not exactly as fascinating as the latest Dan Brown
novel. If you just want the bottom line, many financial advisors recommend
just doing the following: 
1. Open a 401(k) if your employer matches your contributions. Put in at
least enough to get the match.
2. If you have money left over and qualify, open a Roth IRA. Most online
brokers, discussed in Chapter 4, can open a Roth IRA for you.
If you’d rather use online tools to help you decide what to do, check out the
following sites:
 Morningstar (http://screen.morningstar.com/ira/ira
calculator.html?tsection=tollsiracal) has a calculator that
helps you pick the right retirement accounts for you. There are plenty 
of online resources dedicated to retirement issues. 
 Kiplinger.com has a retirement center at (www.kiplinger.com/you
retirement) where you can determine what accounts are best for you. If
you’re confused, some online brokers have financial advisors that can
help you decide, which you can read about in Chapter 4.
 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy (www.360financialliteracy.
org/Life+Stages/Retirement) is maintained by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The site, shown in Figure 3-5,
features advanced online tools that can help you make sure you’re
saving enough for retirement and using the right types of accounts. 
 Hugh’s Mortgage and Financial Calculators (www.hughchou.org/calc)
provides a number of free online calculators that crunch complex financial
problems. There’s a complete section on retirement savings with several
helpful tools. 
 FIRECalc (http://firecalc.com) uses an advanced computerized
model to help you determine how much you must save to retire. It bases
its forecasts using real historical data.
The biggest downside to 401(k)s and most IRA accounts is that you get hit
with a steep 10% penalty for taking money out before you turn 591⁄2, unless
you qualify for some exceptions. And you must start taking money out of a
traditional IRA (not the Roth) when you turn 701⁄2 years old. 
81
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

It’s important that you understand all the catches, so I recommend doing a
little 401(k)/IRA homework by checking out the following Web sites for complete
descriptions of the different types of retirement plans:
 Vanguard (https://flagship.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/
accounttypes/retirement/ATSCompareIRAsContent.jsp) contains
an easy-to-follow chart that explains the advantages of disadvantages of
traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. 
 Investopedia (www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp)
describes 401(k) plans in addition to a new type of 401(k) called the
Roth 401(k)
Anytime you use an account that lets you deduct contributions following the
Don’t Pay Tax Now/Pay It Later principle — any 401(k) plan, for example —
you have to pay the ordinary income tax rate when you withdraw cash. Don’t
let this discourage you, though, because retirement accounts still provide tax
savings to most investors.

401(k)s: A great place to get started
If your employer offers a 401(k) plan or the equivalent for public-service
employees called the 403(b), don’t pass it up. Thanks to the advantages
retirement accounts offer to employees and employers, the 401(k) has been
extremely popular. 
If your company offers a 401(k) and makes matching contributions, that’s the
first account you should open. Passing up on a company match is like turning
away free money. Just be sure this is money you’re not going to need until
you retire. 
Most 401(k) plans let you contribute up to $15,000 for 2007 and $15,500 for
2008. If you’re 50 years old or older, you can kick in an extra $5,000 as a catch-
up contribution. For more details on 401(k) plans, check out 401(k)s For
Dummies, by Ted Benna and Brenda Watson Newmann (Wiley Publishing).
Managing your 401(k) plan online
Just because your 401(k) is tucked away and invested for your retirement
doesn’t mean you can’t manage it online. You have several ways to tune and
tweak your 401(k), including 
 The plan administrators’ site: Most 401(k) plans are easily accessible on
a Web site. From here, you can set all the variables that matter most. You
can instruct your company to withhold a set amount of money from
your pay, decide which mutual funds you want to invest in, and shift
money between mutual funds. You’ll need to contact your company’s
human resources department to find out how to access the account.
 401(k) education sites: Sites such as 401(k) Day (www.401kday.org)
help you take a more active role in making sure you’ll have enough
dough for your golden years. The site has an annual retirement checkup
to tell you if you’re on track and a 401(k) calculator to help you pick the
right 401(k) strategy. Another similar site is 401k.org (www.401k.org),
run by the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, which also provides
information (www.psca.org).
 Regulators’ sites: These sites let you know your rights and the employer’s
obligations. Most retirement plans are overseen by the Department of
Labor, which maintains extensive resources at www.dol.gov/dol/
topic/retirement/typesofplans.htm.
83
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

Most employers require that you work for them for at least a year and that
you be 21 or older before you can sign up for their 401(k) plans. But other
than that, 401(k) plans vary between companies. Some 401(k) plans let you
borrow money and pay interest to yourself. And in 2006, a few employers
began offering Roth 401(k) plans, which combine the benefits of 401(k)s with
Roth IRAs, which you can read about in the next section.
Getting in tune with IRAs
Practically everyone can fund an IRA if they have the money. But they’re
especially attractive if you don’t have access to a 401(k) at work (perhaps
because you’re self-employed) or if the 401(k) at your company doesn’t offer
a match. IRAs, like 401(k)s, offer big benefits when you’re saving for retirement.
The Investor’s Clearinghouse (www.investoreducation.org/IRAs) provides
links to online resources to help you decide if an IRA will work for you.
Several types of IRA(s) exist, but you should really concern yourself only
with the big three:
 Traditional IRAs are available to anyone. They’re a great place to save
money for retirement because you can put away $4,000 a year in 2007
and $5,000 in 2008, and even more if you’re over 50 years old.
Capital gains and dividends in a traditional IRA aren’t taxed until you take
out the money. And, you might be able to deduct your contributions if
you’re not covered by a company-sponsored retirement plan. If you or
your spouse are covered by a company plan, the amount you can deduct
is reduced based on much how you earn. The rules get complicated, but
Vanguard has an excellent primer at https://flagship.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/accounttypes/retirement/ATSTradIRAWho
ContributeContent.jsp that explains how much you may contribute. 
Even if you can’t deduct your contribution, a traditional IRA might still
make sense for you. A nondeductible IRA can be a great place to stash
investments that generate nonqualified dividends and interest such as
REITs and bonds. 
 SEP IRAs are designed for owners of small businesses, employees of
small businesses, and people who work for themselves. They’re easy to
set up and allow employers, including self-employed people, to contribute
up to 25% of compensation to a limit of $45,000 in 2007. Vanguard provides
more information about these plans at https://flagship.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/accounttypes/retirement/ATSSEPIRAOverview
Content.jsp.
84
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

 Roth IRAs are one of the best things going, and if you can open one, you
should. With Roth IRAs, you pay now and play later. You can’t deduct
contributions when you make them, but you can take out the money in
the future tax-free if you’re at least 591⁄2 years old and owned the account
for five years or longer. And unlike traditional IRAs, you’re not required
to take out the money at a certain age, allowing you to pass the giant,
tax-free nest egg to your kids. Just imagine the power of compounding
on an investment sitting untaxed for nearly two lifetimes. It doesn’t get
much better than that.
Roth IRAs are generally best if you think your tax rate will be higher in
the future when you retire. It’s impossible to know what Congress will do
with tax rates in the future. But that’s why many financial advisors say
it’s better to go with a Roth, lock in the rates now, and protect yourself
from the risk of higher tax rates later. 
Setting up an IRA
After you’ve made your decision about what type of retirement account you’re
interested in, be it a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA, you need to find a
broker to set it up. Nearly all the online brokers are equipped to set up all of
these accounts. But before signing up, make sure there are
 No extra fees or higher commissions: In fact, online brokers might cut
you special deals on your IRA accounts. This is something to look for
when evaluating online brokers, as described in Chapter 4.
 Plenty of low-cost investments to choose from: Most brokerages let you
invest in both individual stocks and mutual funds with IRA accounts. 
Okay, so you’ve decided on a plan for saving for retirement and you’ve picked
the type of accounts best suited for that plan. But how much do you need to
save? Most of the preceding sites help you answer that question. The Choose
to Save site (www.choosetosave.org/ballpark) takes a simplified
approach by giving you a Ballpark Estimate of how much you’ll need. And
Analyze Now! (www.analyzenow.com) provides a Free Programs section
stuffed with spreadsheets that can help you answer many of the questions
you need to be asking yourself. In fact, the site even has an Investment
Manager spreadsheet that can help you choose the right kind of accounts for
planning your retirement.

Should you turn your traditional IRA into a Roth?
Do you have a traditional IRA and wish you had
a Roth? Some tax payers can convert their tra-
ditional IRA to a Roth. Before doing that, though,
you should consult several online resources,
including
 General sources,such as Motley Fool (www.
fool.com/investing/small-cap/
2004/12/03/roth-ira-conversion
considerations.aspx), provide guide-
lines where a conversion would make
sense. 
 Comparison Web sites help you know what
you stand to gain or lose from the transforma-
tion. The rules surrounding Roth and traditional
IRAs are complex. If you’re not sure about any-
thing, check out Vanguard’s comparison site 
at https://flagship.vanguard.

MoneyChimp (www.moneychimp.com/

Going Back to School with
Education Savings Accounts
Several special types of education savings accounts provide lucrative tax
breaks, giving you a fighting chance to keep up with college costs. You need
any help you can get because tuition costs rise at about twice the rate of
most consumer goods. 
The two main types of education savings accounts are the 529 plan and the
Coverdell. Both 529s and Coverdell accounts work much like the Roth IRA,
discussed in the previous section, in that you put after-tax dollars into the
accounts and watch them grow tax-free. You can take out the money, without
paying any tax, as long as you use the cash to pay for qualified education
expenses. The Internal Revenue Service
(www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html) describes qualified 
education expenses as “tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment required
for enrollment or attendance” to an eligible school. “Reasonable” room and
board costs are also included for students that go to school at least half-time.
Three numbers you need to know: 529
When saving for college, it’s tough to beat the 529. These are college savings
plans typically run by states or educational institutions. The plans have several
extremely positive attributes, such as 
 Tax savings: As the earlier example describes, the tax savings from 529
plans makes them worthwhile. The tax savings can be even sweeter in
some states that let you deduct your contributions to the state plan
from your income. 
 Control: Even though your child is the beneficiary of the money, you
remain the owner. That’s an important distinction because it means if
Junior decides to run off and join the circus, he can’t get the 529 money.
529 plans don’t just have to be used for a kid. Open one for yourself if
you’re thinking about going back to school. And don’t worry, your
money won’t be wasted if your child gets a scholarship. You can change
the beneficiary to anyone else you want or even use the money to pay
for more schooling for yourself. The downside is there are penalties to
pay if you take the money out and don’t use it to pay for college.
 Availability and flexibility: Unlike most other tax-advantaged accounts,
which are mired with complex rules and restrictions, anyone can have a
529 account. There are limits to how much you can contribute, but they’re
generous, allowing you to contribute up to $12,000 a year in 2007 without
triggering estate tax issues. For information on the limits, Forbes has a
87
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

helpful estate planning section at (www.forbes.com/finance/taxes
estates). And if you want more of an overview, check out Estate
Planning For Dummies, by Brian Caverly and Jordan Simon (Wiley
Publishing).
 Lots of options: Every state offers at least one 529 plan, and you can invest
in any state’s plan even if your child won’t go to school in that state. So
even if you invest in Utah’s 529 plan, you can still use the money if your
child wants to go to University of California, Los Angeles in California. 
 Something for everyone: Some states, but not all, offer two types of 529
plans: prepaid and savings. With prepaid plans, you transfer the investment
risk to the state by agreeing to pay the current price of a college education
and essentially locking in the price. With savings plans, you contribute
any amount you want and try to grow it by choosing wise investments. If
you save and invest wisely with a 529 savings plan, you could make
enough to pay for your kid’s college and maybe part of a grandkid’s, too. 
Getting up to speed on 529 plans online
Some of the great things about 529 plans are that they’re easy to sign up for,
you can fund them without worrying about tax laws for the most part, and
the investments are pretty much preselected. The biggest decision you must
make is whether you’ll opt for a plan offered by your state or go for one in
another state. 
Always evaluate and consider your own state’s 529 plan before looking else-
where. If your state lets you deduct contributions to its 529 plan, that might
be a compelling feature you won’t want to miss out on.
Here are the primary ways to research and find out about 529 plans:
 College savings information sites: Savingforcollege.com (www.saving
forcollege.com) is a supersite when it comes to all things about college
savings. You can find tutorials galore that show you how to pick a plan,
decide which state’s 529 plan is best for you, compare different 529 plans
and fees and even provide links to the plans so you can sign up. College
Savings Plans Network (www.collegesavings.org) helps you sort
through the various options for saving for college. FinAid.org (http://
finaid.org/savings) primarily deals with financial aid, but it also
has resources on savings plans.
 The states’ 529 plan sites: Each 529 plan runs its own Web site that gives
you all the details on how much you can contribute, what your investment
options are, what the fees are, and other things you need to know. The
best way to find links to states’ plans is through the Savingforcollege.com
site, although Table 3-5 contains links to some plans.

 Broker or mutual fund’s sites: Some states’ 529 plans are administered
by large brokerage or mutual fund companies. In those cases, you can
find out more about the plans directly from the administration companies.
Vanguard, for instance, handles Nevada’s Vanguard 529 College Savings
Plan and Iowa’s College Savings Iowa 529 plan. You can find out about
both plans, and 529 plans in general, at Vanguard (https://
flagship.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/accounttypes/college/AT
S529CollegeOVContent.jsp). Fidelity operates California’s plan and
also offers a national plan. You can read about those plans at http://
personal.fidelity.com/planning/college/content/fidelity_
managed_529_plans.shtml.cvsr?refhp=pr&ut=A17.
 529 ratings and analysis sites: You can find additional commentary from
sites that make it their business to rank 529 plans. Some examples include
529Ratings.com (www.529Ratings.com) and CNNMoney.com (www.cnn
money.com), which routinely rate 529 plans. You can find additional
information at the College & Education section of Yahoo! Finance (http://
finance.yahoo.com/college-education) and from the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulatory body (www.finra.
org/RulesRegulation/IssueCenter/p006293). FINRA is one of the
regulatory bodies that oversees 529 plans along with the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (www.msrb.org/msrb1/mfs/

Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You

Understanding 529 fees
As great as 529 plans are, there are fees and charges to be familiar with. When
evaluating plans, you want to see how the fee structures will affect your
contributions and account balance to determine which are the best. The fees
you need to know about include 
 Enrollment fees are upfront fees some 529 plans charge to set up your
account. Most 529s don’t charge these, and you should try not to pay
them if you can help it.
 Account maintenance fees are charged on an ongoing basis just to track
and handle your account. These fees are a little more common than
enrollment fees. 
 Program maintenance fees are charged by almost all 529 plans to cover
the costs of running the 529. These fees generally run between 0.1% of
assets to 1.1%.
 Fees charged by funds owned by the 529 plan are also common. Say
you invest in the Utah 529 plan, which invests in Vanguard funds. Those
Vanguard funds themselves have fees that you must pay. These fees tend
to be less than 1% of assets.

FINRA (http://apps.finra.org/investor_Information/Smart/
529/Calc/529_Analyzer.asp) maintains a Web site that can help you
weigh all the different fees and choose the plan best for you.
You might worry your child may have trouble getting financial aid if you stuff
a ton of money into a 529 plan. Don’t worry. It’s not a big concern because
the formula used for financial aid doesn’t heavily factor in 529 plans. All that
means, though, is that 529s do count a bit. If you want to keep the 529 com-
pletely out of the formula, you can legally name your child’s grandparent as
the owner of the account. That way the 529 won’t count against your child’s
financial aid application at all.
Living in the 529’s shadow: The Coverdell
529s get most of the attention, and for good reason: They’re a great tax shel-
ter for money needed to pay for education. But Coverdell accounts have one
giant advantage over 529s: You can use money from a Coverdell to pay for
kindergarten, primary school, and secondary school, in addition to college.
529s can be used only for college costs. Even so, Coverdell accounts have
several drawbacks, including
 Contributions are limited to $2,000 a year.
 You can’t earn too much income or you can’t make the full contribution.
 Contributions aren’t allowed after the beneficiary turns 18 years old.

better than a 529, at www.savingforcollege.com.

I
n this chapter, I dive through the offers from all the major online brokerages
to pinpoint which ones fit your needs. Why can’t I save you the trouble
and just tell you which broker is the best? It’s not that easy. Choosing “the
best” brokerage is like choosing the most beautiful painting in an art museum.
Everyone has an opinion based on what is most important to him or her.
When choosing a broker, if you’re most interested in dirt-cheap commissions
and don’t care much for service, you have one set of brokers to pick from. If
you’re looking for access to physical branches staffed with live people who
can help you choose stocks or navigate the Web site, you have an entirely
different set of candidates. 
You might think you don’t need this chapter because you like a certain broker’s
ads on TV or have a cousin who swears by his online broker. But don’t under-
estimate the benefits that will accrue for you if you thoroughly research your
broker options — face it, your broker is the gatekeeper to your money, and
picking the right one will partly determine how successful you are as an
investor. 
Finding the Best Broker for You
People are constantly looking for the “best” of everything. Photography buffs
pour through magazines and Web sites looking for the best camera, com-
muters seek the best car, and parents search for the best stroller. Similarly,
investors are on a constant quest for the best online broker. But just as differ-
ent cameras, cars, and strollers fit different people’s needs, the same is true

with brokerages. As I explain in the previous three chapters, investors have
different goals, taste for risk, and resources. And that’s why one person’s
broker can be perfect for him or her, but completely wrong for you. 
Not thoroughly researching your broker is a mistake. The fact that people
often rush to pick an online broker might explain why many aren’t happy
with their choice: During 2006, 41% of online investors had a problem with
their brokers, says rating service J.D. Power. That’s up from 37% in 2005 and
27% in 2004. 
Main factors to consider
Brokers differ from one another in nine main ways. If you’re aware of these
nine things and understand what you’re looking for, you can quickly eliminate
brokers that don’t fit your needs. The factors to consider are 
 Commissions: Perhaps the most important consideration for many
investors is the price charged for executing trades, known as the
commission. I discuss fees at length later in the chapter. 
 Availability of advice: One way brokers separate themselves is whether
or not they give you any help picking investments. On one end of the
spectrum are the full-service traditional brokers that are all about giving
you personalized attention. Not only will they pick stocks for you, but
they’ll also pour you coffee and serve you donuts when you visit them in
their fancy offices. If you’re not interested in paying for such niceties, the
self-service brokers are happy to oblige. Self-service brokers give you the
tools you need, and then you’re pretty much on your own. A few brokers
fit somewhere between full service and self service. 
 Access to an office: Some brokers exist only in cyberspace. It’s up to you
to have your own computer and Internet connection. But others have
branch offices in certain cities and allow customers to stop in, do some
trading, and sometimes take classes and fraternize with other investors.
You may think having access to a branch office will be important to you;
after all, you’re an online investor. Still, rating service J.D. Power found
the 41% of online investors who have access to branch offices tend to be
happier with their online brokers. Go figure. 
 Other banking services: A brokerage account doesn’t have to be a financial
island. Some brokerage firms let you move money from your trading
account into other types of accounts, such as high-yield savings or
checking accounts. Some also provide ATM cards or credit cards. 
 Speed of execution: When you click Buy or Sell on the Web site, it doesn’t
mean the trade is done. Your order snakes its way from your computer
to other traders on Wall Street, where it is filled. Some brokerages have
spent a great deal of effort giving you the fastest path to other traders.
That’s generally beneficial because it means you get a price that reflects
94
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

the true value of the stock you’re buying or selling. Depending on your
strategy, you might not want your orders piling up in a bin, waiting to get
filled. Speed of execution is tracked by broker-rating services, discussed
later in this chapter, in the section “Finding Out What Reviewers Think.” 
 Customer service: Do you have a question about your account or about
making a trade? When you do, you’ll need to reach the broker and ask it.
The levels of service vary wildly. Some brokers have customer service reps
available at your beck and call either in offices or on the phone. Others let
you e-mail a question and wait for an answer. 
 Site reliability: No one wants to be in the position of finding a promising
investment only to discover that his or her online brokerage is down for
repair. Some brokerages have focused on limiting system downtime, which
might be important to you if you trade many times a day. Again, this is
something brokerage-rating services measure.
 Access to advanced stock-buying tools: Some brokerage sites are pretty
bare-bones because they assume the investors already have the software
and tools they need. Other brokerages, though, provide comprehensive
tools that can track your tax liabilities, help you go prospecting for stocks,
or monitor market movements or breaking news.
 Ease of use: Online brokers geared for people new to online investing or
who plan to trade very infrequently are minimalist and have as few buttons
as possible. They’re the Zen of trading. But those aimed for hyperactive
traders who click Buy and Sell so many times they have calluses on their
fingers tend to give investors dozens of options allowing them to do some
advanced stuff. You place a buy order when you want to own a stock and
a sell order when you want to unload it.
“Gotchas” to watch out for
Brokerage firms often have confusing commission structures to fool you into
thinking you’ll pay less than you ultimately do. Make sure you check to see
whether the firm charges extra for certain types of orders, such as limit orders
(I discuss limit orders in Chapter 5) or mutual funds. Some brokers zing you
with fees or inflate commissions if you don’t keep a balance of a certain size.
Some brokers also charge you for switching to another broker. Always check
before signing up for covert fees. The “Avoiding Hidden Fees” section later in
the chapter will help you spot things to watch out for.
Separating the Types of Brokerages
Choosing a brokerage firm might seem intimidating, but it’s really no different
than picking a restaurant. There are fast-food restaurants, where you have to
walk up to the counter, place your order, put on your own ketchup and mustard,
95
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

and find a place to sit. Then there are full-service restaurants where you’re
seated and pampered by dressed-up waiters who bring everything at your
command and even clean the bread crumbs away when you’re done. 
The same goes for brokerages. Self-service brokers give you everything you
need to get the job done and let you have at it. Because you’re doing much of
the work yourself, unless you ask for help, self-service brokers tend to have
the lowest commissions. Self-service brokers are commonly grouped in three
baskets: deep discounters, discounters, and premium discounters. Then
there are the full-service traditional brokerages, which hold your hand
through the whole process, down to suggesting investments, analyzing your
portfolio, and offering estate-planning services. Remember that these are
general brokerage types, and sometimes the lines blur a bit because some
self-service brokers, especially the discounters and premium discounters, let
you buy advice from them if you ask. 
If you can’t find a page on the broker’s site that lists all its fees, commissions,
and other charges in less than three mouse clicks from the home page, look
elsewhere. I’ve found that brokers that bury fees do so for a reason. 
How do you decide what you need? It’s really a matter of deciding ahead of time
how often you intend to trade, what types of investments you plan to buy, and
how long you’ll hold them. It’s difficult to know this in advance, but there are
ways to figure it out. For instance, did you perform the trading simulations I
mention in Chapter 2? If so, how often did you trade? Next, familiarize yourself
with the four types of online brokers: deep discount, discount, premium
discount, and full-service traditional. Read the following descriptions and see
what you can expect to get at each level. Decide whether the extra whistles and
bells are worth the extra cost. To make things easy, the key stats are summarized
in charts after each section. I include the standard commissions to give you the
most realistic scenario for each broker. 
Double-check brokers’ fees before signing up — they change frequently. Also
remember some brokers might charge lower commissions if you pay a monthly
subscription fee, meet certain balance thresholds, or hold other types of
accounts in addition to the brokerage account.
Deep discounters: Trading for $5 or less
These are the Wal-Marts and Home Depots of the brokerage world. When you
sign up for a deep discounter, you’re on your own. But if you know what you’re
doing, that’s a good thing because you don’t have to worry about getting
pestered by a financial advisor trying to pitch stocks you have no interest in.
And you’ll get all the basics that you truly need, such as year-end tax statements,
company information mailed to your door (if you choose paper delivery), basic
access to stock quotes and research, and the ability to buy and sell stocks
and other investments. But the real beauty of these brokers is their sweet,
96
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

low price: Because they don’t offer niceties like branches, they can have the
lowest commissions, usually $5 a trade or less. Leaders include
 BUYandHOLD is pitching for investors looking for an all-you-can eat buffet
of trading. For $14.99 a month, you can place as many trades as you like,
or for $6.99 a month you can place two free trades. The trades aren’t
done immediately at those prices, but instead, in one of three trading
sessions during the day. Real-time trades will cost you $15 apiece. 
 ShareBuilder is trying to prove that deep discounters aren’t just for
active traders. You can buy stocks for $4. ShareBuilder caters to beginners,
though. The site tries to keep things simple by allowing you to enter the
dollar amount you want to spend buying stock, not the number of shares,
as many brokerages do. There are some sacrifices, though. The discounted
$4 orders aren’t executed immediately, but rather, pooled and filled once a
week. This is a deal killer if you’re a day trader — someone trying to jump
in and out of stocks several times a day to make a quick profit. If you want
to buy a stock immediately, the commission jumps to $15.95. And be sure
you’re not planning on selling much because the commission for sell
orders is also $15.95. 
 SogoInvest’s $3-a-trade offer fits snugly between Zecco, discussed below,
and TradeKing. Its biggest advantage for some investors is that it offers
discounted commissions in exchange for a subscription fee. That might
make sense if you trade enough. For instance, if you pay $10 a month,
you get a $1 break on trades, making the fee $2. Just make sure you trade
at least 11 times a month, or you’re wasting your money on this offer.
Also, the brokerage nickels and dimes on a few things, such as charging
$3 for paper statements. You must keep at least $2,500 in your account.
 TradeKing aims to give investors a few more niceties than other deep
discounters, such as the ability to write checks against cash balances of
$1,000, access to company news and research reports and a straightfor-
ward flat-fee commission of $4.95. It’s geared largely for active investors
who might exceed trading limits imposed by free offers from Zecco and
want instant access to customer support on the phone. It’s also targeted
for heavy investors in options and offers a tool on its Web site, called
the Profit + Loss Calculator, that graphs an options strategy and helps
determine its success. There is no minimum account balance.
 Zecco’s $0 commission is hard to beat if price is what matters most to
you. Trades are free as long as you place fewer than ten trades a month
and maintain an account balance of $2,500. Even if you use up all the
freebies or have less than $2,500 in your account, trades are just $4.50. If
you trade options (more advanced investments that I discuss in Chapter 5),
you can save money here too with prices of $4.50 a trade and $0.50 per
contract. And like brokerages that charge much higher commissions, Zecco
will even move, or sweep, your uninvested cash into a high-yield checking
account if you ask it to. It’s not just for rich folks, either. In 2007, Zecco cut
its minimum investment from $2,500 to $0. 
97
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

As for the downsides, some extras (the ability to write checks against
cash in your account, for example) cost you. And the free commissions
do not apply to mutual funds, which cost $10 to buy and sell. You can
view many of Zecco’s offerings from its main page, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Beginning investors always ask me how much money they need to start and
where they can get started investing online. You can start with next to noth-
ing with brokers that have no minimum deposit requirements, such as Share
Builder and TradeKing. TradeKing will even reimburse you for fees your old
broker might charge if you switch. If you’re the kind of person who can’t
seem to save money until you’ve sent your cash off to a bank or brokerage,
these are great places to start. Also, Zecco is hard to beat for beginners
because all your money works for you rather than being siphoned off to pay
commissions. 
Discounters: Trading for $5.01 to $13
If the thought of being completely on your own makes you nervous but
you’re not willing to give up low-cost commissions, the discount brokers sit
in the sweet spot for you. These brokers suit most investors ranging from
beginners to the more advanced because they generally offer some advice (if
you ask for it), and many have offices in most major cities. Even if you’re not
looking for advice, the discounters are still appealing because they load their
Web sites with advanced tools to help do-it-yourself investors of all levels.
Some provide access to advanced trading tools, real-time stock quotes, or
special computer programs that let you enter trades just as fast as the
traders on Wall Street. These extras come with slightly higher commissions,
about $5.01 to $13, but still might be worthwhile based on your style of
investing. Most discounters also offer price breaks if you’re a hyperactive
trader. The names to know here are
 Charles Schwab tries to be the Toyota Camry of brokers: not flashy or
exotic in any one area but practical and pleasing to the bulk of investors.
Its $12.95-per-trade commissions aren’t the cheapest, but for that price,
the broker adds services that might be valuable, whether you’re looking
for help or want to be left to your own devices. Do-it-yourselfers might like
Schwab’s Equity Ratings, a computerized system that evaluates stocks
and assigns them letter-grade scores from A to F. It also provides access to
Wall Street research and a full suite of banking services, including high inter-
est rates paid on cash sitting in your account. But if you decide later you
need more help, Schwab offers mutual funds designed to fit very specific
needs in addition to making consultants available to give you personalized
advice. If you’re not going to use all these extra services, though, the higher
commission might not be worth it. You can see the site in Figure 4-2.
 E*Trade has a reputation as being an innovator in the industry and
seems to be always looking for ways to separate itself from others.
E*Trade has long targeted active traders with computer software, such as
MarketTrader, which lets you enter trades that will trigger automatically
based on rules you set ahead of time. That way, you can buy and sell
stocks even if you’re not sitting in front of your computer. But E*Trade
99
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

has things for beginners, too, such as access to stock research from six
providers and the ability to shift cash to a checking or high-yield savings
account. The commissions range from $6.99 to $12.99 based on 
your account balance and how often you trade. 
The biggest strike against this broker is that it charges an account service
fee of $40 per quarter, unless you meet one of several requirements, such
as keeping at least $10,000 worth of cash and stocks in your brokerage
account, trading at least once every three months, or having 
other accounts at E*Trade.
 OptionsXpress, as its name implies, is focused on investors who like to
trade options. I explain options in more detail in the next chapter, but for
now, suffice it to say that they’re financial instruments that let investors
either reduce risk or turbocharge their returns. Options trades can get
mind-numbingly complicated, and some are best-known by exotic names
like butterflies, straddles, and strangles. OptionsXpress helps traders
place these complex trades with easy-to-follow Web screens and systems
to help track the profit or loss.
This brokerage is clearly geared for active traders. Stock trades start at
$9.95, but only if you make nine or more trades in a quarter. Otherwise,
it jumps up to $14.95.

 Scottrade tries to undercut the big three (Schwab, E*Trade, and TD
Ameritrade) on price but not service. Its $7 commissions are considerably
less, but you still get access to branches, and it also has a separate 
service for active traders. It even throws in access to free software that
shows real-time stock quotes, something you’d usually get only from
more expensive brokers. Scottrade’s Web site is relatively plain, which
can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your goals.
 TD Ameritrade’s earliest customers were active traders looking for low
commissions. Some aspects of the brokerage’s roots are still visible, espe-
cially the flat $9.99-per-trade commission no matter how many shares you
buy or sell. (Other brokers, such as Schwab, charge extra if you buy more
than 1,000 shares.) Investors who trade frequently during the day also like
TD Ameritrade’s bonus PC software trading tools, like the Streamer Suite
and Strategy Desk, which let you see second-by-second stock price move-
ments or test trading strategies and analyze how they would have done.
The biggest knock against TD Ameritrade, though, has been that it has 
traditionally paid low rates of return on cash sitting in your account, 
especially if your balance is less than $10,000.
101
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
Are free trades really free?
When anything claims to be “free” in online
investing, your defenses should go up instantly.
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Zecco.com
all promise free trades to investors. Be on guard
and evaluate all the stipulations, though, before
assuming these free offers are best for you.
(See the section on hidden fees later in this
chapter). The first thing to remember when
looking at free brokerages: Don’t overlook what
interest rate will be paid on cash sitting in your
account. Not paying attention to interest rates
could wipe out any savings you think you’re get-
ting from free trades.
Here’s what I mean. Say you trade five times a
year and normally leave about $10,000 of unin-
vested cash in your account. If trades are free,
it’s true, your commission costs would be zero.
But you still could be overpaying if you’re not
getting a high rate of return on your uninvested
cash. In fact, you’d be $385 better off paying
$12.95 a trade if you get 4.5% interest on cash
sitting in your account. 
I’ve come up with a formula that takes the guess
work out of “free” trades: 
1. Multiply the number of trades you do each
year by the commission. Save this number.
2. Multiply the amount of uninvested cash you
expect to keep in your account by the inter-
est rate you will collect. Divide this number
by 100 and save the result.
3. Subtract the answer from Step 2 from the
answer from Step 1.
This formula shows you how much the commis-
sions are costing you: The lower the number,
the better. If you’re choosing between a couple
of brokers, crunch this formula and choose the
broker with the lowest (or negative) number. 

 thinkorswim isn’t as well known as some of the other brokers, but with
$9.95 commissions, it’s worth a look. The brokerage makes itself a little
different by offering to pay for your Internet connection, up to $39.95 a
month, if you trade 40 times or more a month. It also offers three free
mutual fund transactions a month. It targets the options investors by letting
them buy stock for a commission of just a nickel if it’s part of an options
strategy (more on this when I talk about options in the next chapter).
Needless to say, this broker is for active stock and options traders only.

Premium discounters: Trading
for $13 or more
Premium online brokers aren’t trying to win your business by tempting you
with rock-bottom commissions. They’re not the cheapest, and you can expect
to pay $13 or more for stock trades. But they attempt to justify their higher
cost with the prospect of a more rewarding trading experience, ranging from
a better designed Web site to eliminating maddening system outages. If you’re
going to pay the extra dough, just make sure you’re getting premium service
or you’re wasting your money. The premium online brokers include

 Ameriprise is all about the advice. If you’re looking for access to profes-
sional help for all your financial questions, open an account with Ameri-
prise and expect to get calls from financial planners offering help. You
can also get extras like American Express Gold Cards and discounts on
home equity lines of credit. If these extras sound reassuring, it might be
worth the relatively higher $19.95 commission. But if it sounds like open-
ing the door to telemarketers, this isn’t the brokerage for you, because
trades are relatively pricey and there is a $20 quarterly account fee
unless you meet requirements.
 Bank of America might not be what you think of as a stockbroker, but it’s
one of the large banks aggressively boosting its brokerage services.
Traditionally, banks have targeted the well heeled with personal bankers
who pick out investments like personal shoppers pick out ties for rich
executives. But Bank of America has added self-service brokerage fees with
reasonable commissions starting at $14. And you can get 30 free trades a
month if you keep at least $25,000 with the bank in a deposit account. As
your account grows, you have access to the wealth management services
offered by the bank. Be careful, though, because the bank will hit you with
a $50 fee twice a year if you don’t have other accounts with it.
 Fidelity gets good marks for making its Web site (see Figure 4-3) easy to
navigate and getting trades through quickly, according to a study by
Keynote, an Internet rating service. But again, it’s not going to win a price
war at $19.95, unless you trade 120 times a year, when the commission
falls to a more competitive $8. 
 Vanguard gets bragging rights after winning top online brokerage rating
from J.D. Power in 2006 — despite its higher-than-average $25 trading
commissions for stocks. Vanguard’s site came out on the top for speed,
the quality of customer service, and availability to help customers navi-
gate the site and make investment decisions. Remember, Vanguard’s
stock brokerage offering is separate from the account that lets you buy
and sell Vanguard mutual funds, which I cover later. Just keep in mind
that Vanguard isn’t the cheapest option, and it also charges some
investors a $30 yearly fee.
 Wells Fargo is another bank following the model of using brokerage ser-
vices to tempt customers to put more money in its hands. Wells Fargo’s
self-service stock commissions start at $19.95. But if you keep at least
$25,000 in your accounts, you can get up to 100 free trades a year. The
Wells Fargo plan is a bit better than Bank of America’s in that the $25,000
doesn’t have to be sitting in a deposit account, like a savings account,
but also includes the value of the stocks in your portfolio. But falling
short of the $25,000 balance can be costly, resulting in a $25 a month fee.

Full-service traditional
Because you’re reading Online Investing For Dummies, chances are good that
you’re a do-it-yourself kind of investor or one looking for minimal handholding.
But maybe after reading the preceding descriptions, you’re looking for even
more help. That’s when you might consider a full-service traditional broker. 
Full-service brokers pride themselves on being part of your team of “people”
who you call on routinely for advice, like your real estate agent, housekeeper,
and mechanic. The top full-service traditional brokerages are the Wall Street
firms you’ve probably heard of, such as Merrill Lynch (shown in Figure 4-4),
Wachovia, Smith Barney, Edward Jones, Morgan Stanley, and UBS. And by now,
most can legitimately call themselves online brokerages because they have
Web sites that let you view your accounts. Services that these firms provide
include
 Constant stock recommendations: Most big Wall Street firms have
famous strategists and analysts who think big thoughts and come up
with stock tips. The brokers then spread those tips to you. 
Figure 4-4:

Lynch

service. 
105
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

 Access to initial public offerings: When companies go public, they first
sell their shares to large Wall Street investment banks. Those shares,
especially if the initial public offering is expected to be popular, are often
a sought-after commodity because they have the chance to pop in value
the first day. If you’re an active customer with these firms’ brokerage
divisions, you might get a shot at buying these shares at the IPO price.
(You find more on IPOs in Bonus Chapter 2 on the Web site associated
with this book.)
 Availability of other financial services: If you’re a customer with a 
full-service traditional brokerage, you might get extra financial services,
such as help with your taxes or estate planning. 
But before you get too excited about the extra services that traditional full-
service brokers may provide, there are also downsides to consider, such as 
 High cost: Wall Street firms have to pay for those fancy offices you’re
enjoying somehow. The fees tend to be higher, and you might pay a lofty
commission for each trade or pay a percentage of your assets. 
 Uneven treatment: Remember that it’s unlikely you’ll end up being
Merrill Lynch’s best customer, so don’t expect to get the real goods. For
instance, when shares of the next truly promising IPO are doled out, if
you’re not a top customer or famous, you probably won’t get shares
anyway. (Fees and rates can vary, too, which is why I didn’t even bother
coming up with a table comparing fee structures for the full-service 
traditional brokerage crowd.)
 Potential for conflicts: Because brokers are often paid by commission,
they might have an incentive to urge you to trade more frequently than
you might like. 
Be skeptical if a friend or family member recommends a broker to you. Many
brokerage firms give customers checks for $50 or more or dozens of free
trades if someone they refer signs up. I’m not telling you that you can’t trust
your friends. Just know that people recommending their broker might have a
motive other than telling you which broker is best for you. 
Avoiding Hidden Fees
The stock trade commission is likely the fee you’ll pay the most often, so it’s
wise to pay the most attention to it. But don’t think it’s the only fee. Brokers
often charge a host of other fees, which, depending on your circumstance,
106
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

can add up fast. You should look for a page that discloses these fees, like the
one shown in Figure 4-5. Here are some common hidden fees you should be
aware of: 
 Maintenance fees are monthly, quarterly, or annual fees some brokers
charge you just to have an account with them. Don’t pay maintenance
fees. Period. If you’re paying them, you’re probably at the wrong broker
for you. Most brokers exempt you from paying maintenance fees if you
meet certain requirements. If you can’t meet them, switch to a different
broker. 
 Transfer fees are charged when you want to part ways with your broker.
Expect to get nicked with a $50 or higher fee, which brokers charge sup-
posedly to cover their cost of shipping all your stock holdings and trans-
ferring cash to your new broker. The only way to avoid this charge is
selling all the stocks in the old account and then writing a check to the
new broker drawn on your old account. But this might not work. Keep in
mind that you’ll incur commissions for every stock you sell, and tax con-
siderations might cost you well over $50. Refer to Chapter 3 for a
refresher on capital gains taxes. Some brokers, including TradeKing,
don’t charge a transfer fee.
 Certificate fees are charged if you want your broker to mail you the
actual physical stock certificates you own. It’s usually a $50 or higher
charge.
 Check-writing fees range dramatically from broker to broker. Some
charge you an annual fee to have the privilege to write checks against
your account. Others give you a certain number of free checks and
charge only if you write rubber checks that bounce. 
 Special orders are added fees if you trade more than a set number of
shares. Most brokers also charge extra for placing so-called limit orders —
trades in which you set the price you’re willing to accept. Limit orders are
covered in more detail in the next chapter.
 Margin fees are interest charges resulting from borrowing money from
the broker to buy investments with. Buying on margin is only for the
most risk-ready investors, and I explain why in Chapter 5.
107
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

Finding Out What Reviewers Think
It can be overwhelming to parse through all the brokers’ commissions
because there appear to be more moving parts than in a Swiss watch.
Minimum requirements and fees vary, and it’s hard to know how fast a
broker’s Web site will be until you actually sign up and try it. Luckily, some
professional reviewers have kicked the tires for you. Different rating services
and publications that evaluate brokers each year include
 ConsumerSearch.com: These folks review the reviews, compiling what
other rating services, Web sites, and publications say about everything
from toasters to cars to, yes, discount online brokers. The site, shown in
Figure 4-6, also has a comprehensive section that ranks the reviews of
online brokers and summarizes their findings.
 J.D. Power: Although it’s best known for rating cars, J.D. Power also
evaluates both online and full-service traditional brokers every year. It
rates brokers based on several criteria, including cost, customer service,
how quickly trades are completed, Web site design, data that’s provided,
and overall satisfaction. Read the latest reviews at www.jdpower.

provides tools on its Web site to help you decide which is best for you.
Its findings are available at www.smartmoney.com/brokers.
 Barron’s: A Wall Street fixture since the 1920’s, Barron’s keeps an eye out
for online brokers that serve sophisticated investors best. You’ll have to
subscribe, though, to read the stories online. An online subscription costs
$79 a year. Barron’s Online is available at http://online.barrons.
com/public/main.
 Gomez: It certainly hasn’t been around as long as Barron’s, but Gomez
does bring a bit of science to the process by measuring brokerages’
speed and their likelihood to keep running even during hectic days on
Wall Street. It rates them by constantly measuring the number of sec-
onds you have to wait for the Web site to respond to commands, how
often the system is down for maintenance, and generally how reliable it
is. You can view the updated results at www.gomez.com/products/

Is Your Money Safe? Checking
Out Your Broker
When you’re about to hand over your life’s savings to a broker, especially one
with no offices, you want to make sure it’s a reputable outfit. Unlike bank 
savings accounts, brokerages have no government guarantee. But there are
still some safeguards.
Your first layer of protection comes from the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC). The SIPC was formed by Congress in 1970 to protect
investors by promising to help recover and return cash to investors if their
brokerage closes due to bankruptcy. If cash or stock mysteriously goes missing
in your account, the SIPC might help you recover the funds. The SIPC has helped
in the recovery of $15.7 billion for 626,000 investors since it was formed. If a
brokerage fails and doesn’t have enough money to repay customers, the SIPC
will cover up to $500,000 per customer. You should always check whether a broker
is an SIPC member by logging on to www.sipc.org. In addition, some
brokers carry additional insurance to protect customer assets beyond 
$500,000. All the brokers mentioned in this chapter are SIPC members.
Next, make sure your broker is has the appropriate approval from regulatory
bodies to buy and sell investments. You wouldn’t let someone who isn’t a
doctor remove your appendix, right? You should also make sure your broker is
registered to be a broker. You can do this using the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (FINRA) BrokerCheck at www.finra.org. You can access Broker
Check by clicking the FINRA BrokerCheck link on the top left of the page.
BrokerCheck tells you whether the brokerage is registered with this impor-
tant regulatory body and whether the registration is current. Each state also
keeps tabs on brokerages serving customers in their regions. State regulators
are coordinated by the North American Securities Administrators Association,
which provides access to the public at www.nasaa.org.
Lastly, you want to know whether the broker you’re considering has been dis-
ciplined recently. You can access this info in the Rules & Regulation tab at the
top of the screen at www.finra.org and also at a system maintained by the
New York Stock Exchange’s Disciplinary Action database at www.nyse.com/
DiscAxn/discAxnIndex.html. And the ultimate watchdog on Wall Street
is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which maintains records on
brokers at www.sec.gov and provides tips to investors looking to check out
their brokers at sec.gov/investor/brokers.htm.

Cutting the Cord: Wireless Trading
If the idea of checking up on your portfolio and placing trades while sipping
margaritas by the pool appeals to you, get a life. Well, okay, sometimes you
do need to check up on your account even when you’re not sitting behind a
computer at your desk. To help, plenty of brokers are providing wireless
access to account information so customers can access their portfolios at
any time, be it from a BlackBerry, Treo, or other wireless devices. You have
several ways to accomplish this:
 From a laptop: Most laptops are equipped with wireless capabilities. If
your laptop is set up for wireless access, using popular Wi-Fi technology,
you can get online at thousands of locations that offer wireless internet
connections, called Wi-Fi hotspots. Some hotspots available across the
country are free to use, and you can find them by using this site: www.wifi
freespot.com. You can also connect using Wi-Fi services that charge
access fees, including those in Starbucks, Barnes and Noble, and
Borders locations that are part of the T-Mobile network. If you try to go
online in any of these places, you will be prompted by a sign-up screen
to give a credit card number and pay. You can also sign up ahead of time
at home or find out where this widespread network is available here:
http://hotspot.t-mobile.com.
 From a cell phone or PDA: Several online brokers reformat their Web
pages so they appear on the small screen of cell phones and BlackBerries.
Just open the wireless browser in your Web-enabled phone, BlackBerry,
Treo, or Windows Mobile device and type the address of the broker. Most
brokers, such as E*Trade, will detect you’re accessing them from a phone
and reformat the pages automatically. Others, such as thinkorswim,
require you to go to a special Web site from your phone. (In thinkorswim’s
case, that site is www.tosmobile.com.)
Pay Attention to Where Your Cash 
Is Parked: Money-Market Funds
You’re an online investor, right? So why would you care about money that
you haven’t invested? It turns out that one of the biggest secrets in the 
brokerage world is what happens to cash sitting in your account that’s not
invested. Don’t underestimate how important this is. If you have $10,000 in
cash in your account waiting to be invested, that’s worth $450 a year at a
4.5% rate.

A word about wireless security
Security is a serious concern when dealing with
your money, and I discuss how to keep your
money safe in more detail in Chapters 2 and 18.
But when you access your stock data wire-
lessly, especially from a public area, you need
to pay special attention to security. Here are
three ways to do just that:
1. Make sure your data are encrypted.
Most Internet browsers let you know
whether the data is being encrypted, or
scrambled. If you’re using Microsoft’s
Internet Explorer 7, you can check by look-
ing for the icon of a gold padlock. The gold
padlock icon usually appears to the right of
the address bar when a Web site asks for
potentially sensitive information, such as
account numbers, or when the Web site
address begins with https (s stands for
secure) rather than the usual http. When
you see a gold padlock icon, that’s a signal
to you that the data is being scrambled to
make it harder for the guy sitting next to 
you at Starbucks to read your information.
Your computer and Windows then scramble 
your data. The data is then decrypted, or
unscrambled, by the Web site.
You can click the gold padlock icon to get
more information about the security of the
Web site. Be sure to select the check box
that pops up to confirm that the site’s cer-
tificate, or identification, lists the name of
your brokerage firm. If the gold padlock
doesn’t appear, that might mean the site
uses a different method of securing data,
which is something you should ask your
broker about.
The padlock safeguard is a big help, but
even scrambling isn’t 100% secure. To be
extra safe, look for Internet Explorer’s
address bar to turn green, which validates
the connection is safe, although not all
online brokers support this yet.
2. Use virtual private network (VPN) software. 
A VPN is a technology used to protect your
data from snoops over the Internet. Some
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer this
service to customers, or if you’re using your
work laptop, a VPN might be installed
already. You might also consider subscrib-
ing to a VPN service, such as JiWire’s
Hotspot Helper, which costs $24.95 a year.
You can read about it at www.jiwire.
com/hotspot-helper.htm.
3. Consider digital security keyfobs.
Some brokers, such as E*Trade, provide
keyfobs that digitally display a new 6-digit
code every minute. The idea here is that
you’d then take that code and use it (in addi-
tion to your username and password) to log
in to the Web site. The added wrinkle of an
always changing code makes it extremely
unlikely that a hacker could break into your
accounts. 
Be sure to ask your broker what kind 
of protection it gives you if a hacker 
gets into your account. E*Trade, for
instance, will cover the entire loss. Also,
TD Ameritrade (www.tdameritrade.
com/secrity/index.html) provides
a very detailed guide to all the things you
can do to protect your computer when
investing online. You don’t need to be a TD
Ameritrade customer to use the site. The
site also provides tips if you use browsers
other than Internet Explorer.

Which is my way of telling you that, before choosing an online broker, you
want to be absolutely sure what rate of interest your uninvested cash will get
and how it’s handled. Ideally, you want a sweep account. With a sweep
account, idle cash is automatically scooped up and put into a money-market
account. It’s ideal because you don’t have to do anything, and you’re certain
your money is working for you. Just make sure your money is being swept
into a money market that pays an interest rate that is competitive with the
going market rate. Schwab (www.schwab.com) and Ameriprise (www.
ameriprise.com) are two brokers that offer this. Some brokers offer it only
if you ask for it, such as Zecco (www.zecco.com). There’s usually no addi-
tional charge.
Buying Stocks and Mutual Funds
Without a Broker
Can you be an online investor without a broker? Sure. Some investors want to
buy stocks but don’t want to bother with a broker. There’s nothing that says
you need to have a broker to buy and sell stocks or mutual funds.
Stocks: Direct investments
Direct investments are where you buy the stock straight from the company.
Many large companies, such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble (P&G), and Walt
Disney, will allow you to buy and sell your stock with them and avoid a
broker. Many direct investment programs are connected with dividend re-
investment plans (DRIPs), where the companies let you use dividend pay-
ments to buy, or reinvest, additional shares.
If you’re interested in going with a direct investment program, you can visit
the investor-relations section of the company’s Web site to see whether it
offers one. P&G, for instance, has an elaborate Shareholder Investment Program
that lets you buy as little as $250 in stock and will even reinvest the dividends.
You can read about this program (shown in Figure 4-7) at www.pg.com/
investors/purchaseplan.jhtml.
The other way to find direct investment programs is through directory ser-
vices, such as www.directinvesting.com. Just enter the symbol of the
company you’re interested in, and you can see if the company offers a direct
investment plan.
113
Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

Here are the upsides to direct investing:
 Potential commission savings: The fees charged by direct investment
programs can be lower than what some brokers charge. P&G, for
instance, charges $1 for investments plus a 2-cents-per-share charge if
you buy the stock using money from your bank account and just $2.50
plus 2 cents per share if you mail a check.
 Dividend reinvestments: Dividends can be reinvested for free. If you’re
with a broker, you would often need to incur a commission to reinvest a
dividend into the company stock.
As you might suspect, direct investing has some downsides:
 Not free: Some companies even charge commissions that exceed what
deep discount brokerages charge. For instance, P&G charges $10 to sell
stock. There are also loads of additional fees. P&G charges a 5% quarterly
fee, up to $1.25, for plan maintenance.
 Setup fees: Although opening a brokerage account is usually free, some
direct investment plans charge a fee to get started. P&G, for instance,
charges $7.50.

114
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

 Limited universe: By using direct investment plans, you’re narrowing
your universe of possible investments to the hundreds of the largely
older, blue-chip companies that offer these programs. That means you
miss out on younger or small companies.
 Administrative hassles: With direct investment plans, you need to manage
all your separate accounts, which could be a pain if you have ten or more
investments. You also won’t get access to any of the tax assistance or
research the brokers provide.
Mutual funds: Straight from
the mutual fund company
Mutual funds gather money from many investors and use the cash to invest in
a basket of assets. When you buy a mutual fund, you’re joining a pool with
other investors that own assets, rather than owning the assets yourself. You
can read more about mutual funds in Chapter 10.
Nearly all brokers let you buy and sell mutual funds in addition to stocks and
other investments. And sometimes trading in mutual funds can make sense,
especially if it’s free. Most brokers have a list of “transaction-free” mutual
funds you can buy and sell for no charge. Schwab, for instance, lets you buy
and sell more than 2,000 mutual funds that are part of its OneSource program
at no cost.
But, if you’re not going to buy from the transaction-free lists, you’re wasting
your money buying mutual funds this way. Schwab, for instance, charges $49.95
to buy or sell a mutual fund not on its list. Don’t let your broker’s commission
schedule determine which mutual funds you buy.
One of the best things about mutual funds is that you can buy them with no
transaction fee if you deal directly with the mutual fund company. This can
be a tremendous advantage, especially if you’re making frequent and regular
investments into a fund. After you figure out what fund you want to buy, log
on to the mutual fund company’s Web site, open an account, and buy it. You’ll
save yourself some cash.
When opening an account with a mutual fund company to buy a mutual fund,
be sure to open a mutual fund account, not a brokerage account. Several
mutual fund companies, including Vanguard and Fidelity, offer brokerage
accounts in addition to mutual fund accounts, and the fees are completely
different.

Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker

Opening and Setting Up Your Account
After you’ve made the decision about which broker to go with, the hard work
is done. All you need to do to get started is open an account and get your
cash to the broker. You can do this online or through the mail. If you’re com-
fortable doing this online, which I imagine you are because you’re reading
Investing Online For Dummies, the online route is definitely the way to go
because the cash can be transferred from your bank account and you can be
up-and-running in a few hours or days. Signing up by mailing in a check and
application, on the other hand, could take weeks.
If you’d like to practice setting up an account before signing up for real,
check out the demonstration at www.investingonline.org. But, to be
honest, that’s probably not really necessary because the process is very
straightforward.
The checklist of what you need to know
The biggest button on most broker’s Web site is the Open an Account or Start
Now button, so you won’t have trouble finding it. Typically, that’s all you need
to click to launch the area of the Web site that will set up your account. (If you
want to sign up through the mail, click a link to download the necessary forms.)
Typically, you need to know three things to complete the application:
 The kind of account you want to create: This is usually a cash account
or margin account. I cover margin accounts in more detail in Chapter 5.
 The number of people associated with this account: Is this just for you
or for you and a spouse? This will determine whether you create an
individual or joint account. You can review this in Chapter 3. 
 The tax status of the account: Is this a taxable account or a tax-deferred
account such as an IRA or a fund for college? You can review the differences
in Chapter 3.
Most brokers waive maintenance fees if you’re opening an IRA account
because they figure you’ll keep your money with them for quite some time.
Many also waive the minimum deposits. For these reasons, if you’re just
starting out with online investing, you might consider opening a retirement
account first.
116
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

The checklist of what you need to have
You need these bits of info if you want to set up an account:
 Identification, such as a driver’s license or government issued ID card.
 A Social Security Number is necessary, of course. If you’re creating a
joint account, you’ll also need the Social Security Number of the person
you’re setting the account up with. This is used for tax reporting purposes.
 The bank statement of the financial institution from which you’ll
transfer money. This contains the account and banking routing numbers
you’ll need to instruct the broker to get your cash. Keep in mind some
brokers won’t let you open an account with electronically transferred
money if you’re depositing less than $500. In those cases, you need to
mail a check.
 The address of your employer if you’re an officer, director, or large
shareholder of a publicly traded company.
See, that wasn’t hard. And here’s the best part: Now that you’ve entered all
your information and funded your account, you’re all set to start investing.

Getting It Done: How to Enter 
and Execute Trades
In This Chapter
 Understanding the different ways your broker can hold your shares
 Differentiating between different types of orders
 Finding data about options
 Using put and call options
 Appreciating the upsides and downsides to trading after hours
 Knowing the potential reward and risks of buying on margin
A
ll the theory in the world about online investing won’t do you a bit of good
if you can’t seal the deal and execute your trades. Trade execution is the
process of logging in to your online broker and buying or selling investments.
You might be wondering what’s so hard about buying a stock: Just log in to
the online broker’s Web site and click the Buy button. And in some cases,
you’re right. But sometimes you want to be a little more exacting. There are
ways to tailor your buys and sells so your broker carries out the transaction
precisely how you want it handled. For instance, you might want to buy a stock
only if it falls below $25, or you might want your broker to automatically sell
shares if they fall below a certain price. 
In this chapter, I start at the beginning and go over all the ways you can hold
your stock and how that decision affects how your trades are executed. Then,
I’ll go over the main ways to enter orders — ranging from market orders to
limit orders — and talk about the advantages and costs of each. For the
adventurous types, this chapter examines buying investments using borrowed
money, called buying on margin, and also the risks and return of trading after
hours. I then discuss the basics of options, which present unique ways for you
to boost your returns or cut your losses, depending on how you use them.

Understanding How Stock Trades 
and Shares Are Handled
When you buy or sell a share of stock online, you click a few buttons and
everything is done. In a few seconds, if even that long, you’ll often have a
confirmation sitting in the messages section of your online broker’s Web site
or in your e-mail box. The confirmation is a memo showing you what stock
you bought or sold, the number of shares involved, and the price at which
the trade was executed.
But perhaps unbeknownst to you, after you clicked the Buy button, your trade
wiggled its way through countless computer networks where buyers and sellers
competed for your order to buy stock until it was ultimately executed or filled.
You might never need to know how this works, much like you might never need
to know what’s going on under the hood of your car, but it’s an important part
of investing online. So, the following sections describe a day in the life of a trade
that’s on its way from being an order on your computer screen to a done deal.
Ways you can hold your investments
The biggest factor influencing how your investments will actually make their
way to Wall Street depends on how you hold your shares. The three main
types are
 Street name ownership is the most common with most online brokers.
It’s so common that unless you tell your online broker to do otherwise,
your broker will assume you want your shares owned in street name.
 Holding paper stock certificates is the old-school way of owning stocks.
It’s generally not a good idea for the reasons I outline in the section
“Paper certificate ownership,” a little later. If you insist on paper certificates,
you just have to let your online broker know so it can mail them to you.
Generally, despite the few advantages, this isn’t a great idea.
 Direct registration is when the company issuing the stock holds your
stock for you but lists you, not your broker, as the owner. If you buy
stock through a direct stock purchase plan, as discussed in Chapter 4,
this is a common form of ownership.
Street name ownership
If you’re not sure how to hold your shares, street name ownership is probably
your best bet. For most investors, the advantages of this form of ownership
outweigh the few negatives.
120

Shares kept in street name are listed on the books of the company in your
broker’s name, not yours. The broker then lists you as the owner of the shares
on its books. That might seem scary, I know, but you do have safeguards
against broker fraud, as described in Chapter 4.
Street name ownership has several advantages:
 Easy handling of dividends: Dividends paid by companies you own
stock in are sent directly to your online broker, which then deposits them
to your account. For online investors used to doing almost everything on
a Web site, this is a huge advantage and saves you from having to deposit
dividend checks in your bank’s ATM or mailing them to your broker.
 Central source of company documents: If you’re like most online
investors, you’ll probably own shares of several companies. When you
own the stock in street name, all the paper correspondence sent out by
the companies first goes to your broker. The broker then forwards it to
you. This situation has a giant advantage, especially if you move often:
You can just let your broker know where you live and not worry about
missing important documents.
Your broker can also help make sure you get everything that’s due to
you. Periodically, a company you invested in years ago is sued or forced
by regulators to make payments to past investors. If you own the stock
in street name, you can be certain to receive these old payments, even if
you’re living somewhere else, because your broker will forward the checks.
 Security: It’s up to the brokerage to safeguard your stock. And that’s a
good thing because getting paper stock certificates replaced, if you lose
them, can be a hassle.
 Easy to sell: If your online broker has your shares on hand, you can sell
them anytime you want without having to mail in a paper certificate
first. That saves you time and postage, not to mention the worry about
sending an important document through the mail.
Sounds great, right? But, street name ownership does come with a few
disadvantages:
 Potential delays in dividend payments: Some brokers are quicker about
crediting dividends to your account than others. You might have to wait
a few days to actually receive a dividend after it was paid by the company.
 Hassle if your broker fails: Getting stock certificates transferred back to
your name might be harder if your brokerage become insolvent.
Paper certificate ownership
Maybe the cons of street ownership are enough to make you consider Route
#2 — the paper certificate option. I can tell you that the advantages to paper
certificate ownership include the following:
121
Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades

 Cutting out the middleman: Company materials come straight to you.
This can speed up the time it takes to get some documents.
 Using certificates as loan collateral: When you have the actual certificates,
you might have a little easier time using the stock value to secure a loan.
 Having actual certificates makes it easier to give them as gifts or for
display: A paper certificate can be framed and given to young investors
as a present. There’s something nice about having an item to wrap.
 Being in control: With the certificates in your possession, you know
where they are and can decide who can have them.
In all honesty, though, I have to tell you that the main disadvantages to paper
certificate ownership far outweigh the advantages. The disadvantages of
paper certificate ownership include the following:
 Difficulty in selling: You might not be able to sell the stock as quickly as
you’d like. Paper certificates must be mailed to your broker or to the
company or a firm it hires to handle such matters before the stock can
be sold.
 Burden of keeping your contact information current with the company:
It’s up to you to make sure the company has your current address.
 Responsibility for safekeeping the certificates: It’s up to you to keep
the paper certificates safe. You’ll probably have to spend money to get a
safe deposit box or at least lock the paper stock certificates up in your
home somewhere. And when you send them through the mail, you will
need to insure them in case they get lost. Some financial institutions
recommend insuring mailed certificates for 2% of the market value, for
reasons I explain later in this chapter.
If you decide to hold paper certificates rather than listing them in street
name, don’t lose them. Getting lost paper certificates replaced can be a
hassle and somewhat costly. If the unfortunate event does occur, though,
here’s what to do to try to make it right:
1. Call or e-mail your broker or the company’s transfer agent and
explain what happened.
Transfer agents are firms that companies hire to handle the processing of
shares. The transfer agent will likely ask you to say how you lost the shares
in a written report.
2. Buy an indemnity bond with the help of your transfer agent. 
An indemnity bond protects the company that issued the lost stock in
case someone tries to cash it in later. Indemnity bonds usually cost up
to 2% of the market value of the stock you lost.
For more details on what to do if you lose a stock certificate, the Securities
and Exchange Commission maintains advice at www.sec.gov/answers/
lostcert.htm.

Direct registration
If all my talk about the hassles of losing paper certificates makes you long for
another way of owning stock, you can always go for direct registration. You
get several advantages from having direct registration, including
 Company correspondence coming straight to you
 Being able to sell shares without mailing certificates to your broker
 Not having to worry about keeping the certificates safe
Direct registration has two main downsides:
 Inability to sell shares immediately: Selling shares you hold in direct
registration almost always takes longer than you might think. You may
instruct the company to sell the shares, but your request is generally put
into a pool and executed at set times in the future, such as later in the day,
week, or month. You may also sell your shares by instructing the company’s
transfer agent to electronically send the stock to your online broker. (A
transfer agent is a firm hired by a company to track its shareholders and
record transactions.) The transfer process can take a few days, so the
price might change by the time you’re able to sell the stock.
 Pool of stock choices is somewhat reduced: Most companies offer direct
registration, but not all. Many of the stocks you want to buy might not
offer direct registration.
A second in the life of a trade
When you buy or sell a stock on your online broker’s site, your order is usu-
ally filled in seconds. But, before that transaction is completed, in milliseconds
your order snakes its way through an advanced security trading system that
has taken decades to build. Just a few years ago, it could take about 12 seconds
for a trade to go from your desk to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange
and back. But now that most of the steps have been computerized, it takes
about a second. Using NASDAQ as an example, here’s what happens in the
one second it takes to execute an online trade:
1. You enter your order with your online broker.
2. The order is placed in a database.
3. The database checks all the different markets that trade the stock and
looks for the best price. The different markets might include the NASDAQ
and New York Stock Exchange in addition to electronic communications
networks (ECNs). ECNs are computerized networks that connect buyers
and sellers of stocks.
4. The market that successfully matched the buyer and seller sends a 
confirmation to both parties’ brokers.

Buying paper stock certificates online
Due to the disadvantages listed elsewhere in
this chapter, it doesn’t make much sense to hold
paper stock certificates for the shares in your
portfolio. But some investors still like to buy
paper stock certificates for gifts. Some folks col-
lect old stock certificates much like you’d collect
stamps or coins. There’s even a word for the art
of collecting stock certificates: scripophily. If this
interests you, check out these online services
that let you buy paper stock certificates:
 OneShare.com (www.oneshare.com)
and Frame A Stock
(www.framea
stock.com) are single-share sales sites
that understand the lost art and beauty of
many stock certificates. Both let you buy a
share of stock in companies which have
certificates that are popular with individual
investors. Both of these services even
frame the certificates for you. The sites
make it easy to find the perfect stock for the
need. You can sort through the available
certificates based on the occasion, recipi-
ent, or interest. For men, OneShare recom-
mends Harley Davidson and Boston Beer,
and for women it suggests Tiffany and
Coach. Some certificates are also popular
due to the artwork on them, with Disney
being the best example.
Just be forewarned that you’ll pay much
more to acquire stock this way than through
an online broker. In addition to the share
price and framing fees, there’s also a $39
transfer fee to acquire the stock. A $38 a
share stock might easily cost nearly $130 by
the time all the fees are added.
 eBay (www.ebay.com), not surprisingly, is
a source for paper certificates. But because
eBay isn’t licensed to sell securities like
stocks, it has to be careful about what kinds
of certificates its members sell; otherwise,
eBay risks running afoul of securities law.
Only two types of stock certificates may be
sold on eBay. The first type concerns old or
collectible certificates of defunct compa-
nies, such as old railroads or Internet com-
panies. The other type that may be sold on
eBay are single-share stock certificates
packaged as gifts and marked as being
nontransferable. eBay requires that these
certificates sell for at least twice the cur-
rent market value of the stock as evidence
they’re priced based on their keepsake
value.
 Certificate collection sites such as
Scripophily.net (www.scripophily.
net) provide prices on some hard-to-find
certificates. Even if you’re not a collector,
it’s interesting to see what some of the cer-
tificates go for when they’re popular with
collectors. Some Standard Oil stock certifi-
cates, personally signed by John D.
Rockefeller, for instance, sell for $3,000 or
more. Pixar stock certificates, decorated
with characters from Toy Story like Buzz
Lightyear, were a hot commodity when the
company was bought by Disney. Old shares
of Playboy were popular for their, um, art-
work, because the company’s certificates
used to display some, let’s say, assets. The
old certificates have become even more
sought after since Playboy’s new certifi-
cates were changed to be more PG. The old
shares sell for $300 or more, which is
greater than the share price of the com-
pany. And some infamous companies, like
Enron, also have collectible value even
though the companies themselves have
largely vanished, as shown in the following
figure.

5. The order and the price are reported to the regulatory bodies that over-
see trading activity so they can be displayed to all investors.
6. NASDAQ stores a record of the trade in case regulators want to study
past transactions.
7. NASDAQ sends a contract to the broker who sold the shares and the
broker who bought them.
After all that is completed, the brokers have three days, called T+3, to actu-
ally exchange the cash and shares. Then the money or shares are officially in
your account.
ECNs: You have been assimilated
Back in the heyday of day trading in the late 1990s, many investors believed
they could go toe-to-toe with the biggest trading houses in the world. That
feeling stems from the creation of trading networks called ECNs and their
approval by regulators in 1997. ECNs promised to level the trading field by
125
Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades

letting individual investors trade directly with each other, rather than going
through market makers on the NYSE or specialists on the NASDAQ. Market
makers and specialists are middlemen of sorts. They’re traders that get spe-
cial privileges to information in exchange for making sure trading is going
smoothly.
Several handfuls of ECNs cropped up to cut out the middlemen. The biggest
were Instinet, Brut, and Archipelago. Day traders would sign up for these
ECNs and trade with each other. But because ECNs were so efficient and fast
at matching buyers and sellers, they also caught on with big institutional
investors needing to move massive blocks of stock. ECNs got so popular that
the exchanges began losing some trading volume. If you can’t beat them, buy
them. The NYSE’s parent company, NYSE Euronext, bought Archipelago (now
called NYSE ARCA) in 2005. NASDAQ bought Brut in September 2004 and in
2005 acquired Inet, which was formed from the combination of Instinet with
another ECN, called Island.
What does all this mean for online investors today? Now the distinction
between the ECNs and the NYSE and NASDAQ is less, err, distinctive. They’re
so closely tied together that if you enter a stock order online, your broker is
required to check the prices on ECNs to see whether that’s where it can get
the best price. If you can get a better price through an ECN rather than
through an exchange, that’s where your trade will occur. Some brokers let
you choose where you want your order filled through something called direct
routing. If your account is set up for direct routing, you can instruct the
broker to execute the exchange or ECN of your choice, which is usually NYSE
ARCA or Inet.
Direct routing is a bad idea for most online investors. Online brokers have
sophisticated computers that shop your order to all the top markets automati-
cally. They’re required by regulators to get you the best available price. If you
direct-route your order, you lose this advantage and most likely will wind up
paying more. If there’s an advantage to direct routing, I don’t know what it is.
Getting It Done: Executing Your Trades
If you’re buying something from a regular store, say a new computer, you can
either buy it or not. End of discussion. But in more casual marketplaces, such
as flea markets or garage sales, where prices are fluid and changing, there’s a
strategy to buying and selling things. It might surprise you that buying stock
is more like a flea market than shopping at your local Wal-Mart, where prices
are set. Because investments are priced in real time through active bidding
between buyers and sellers, there are techniques to buying and selling.
126
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

Types of orders
When dealing with investments, you have five main ways to buy or sell them
online:
 Market orders are the most common types of orders and the ones you
will probably use the most. This is where you tell your broker to sell
your shares at the best price someone is willing to pay right now or buy
shares at the price currently being offered. Because these orders are
executed almost immediately and are straightforward, they typically
have the lowest commissions. (In Chapter 4, where I discuss different
online brokers’ commissions, I concentrate on market orders because
they’re the most common.)
 Limit orders let you be pickier about the price you’re willing to take for
a stock you’re selling or the price you’re willing to pay if you’re buying.
With a limit order, you tell your online broker the price you’re willing to
take if you’re selling stocks and the price you’re willing to pay if you’re
buying. The order will execute only if your price, or something better, is
reached.
For example, imagine you own 100 shares of ABC, which are trading for
$50 a share. The stock has been on a tear, but you’re convinced it will
fall dramatically soon, by your estimate to $30. You could just sell the
stock outright with a market order, but you don’t want to because you’re
a bit greedy and don’t want to miss out on any gains in case you’re
wrong. A limit order could be the answer. Here, you’d instruct your
broker to sell the stock if it fell to $45 a share. If you’re right, and the
stock falls to $45 a share, your online broker will sell as many shares as
possible at that price. You can also set a time limit on limit orders and
tell your broker to let them expire after a few days or weeks.
The precision of limit orders can be a shortcoming, too. Limit orders 
are filled only at the price you set. If the stock falls further than the price
you set, the broker might be able to sell only some of the shares, or
none, at the price you set. If that happens, you’re stuck with the stock. In
the preceding example, if ABC opened for trading and plunged straight
to $25, never stopping at $45, you will still be holding the stock. This is a
serious limitation that can give you a false sense of security.
 Stop market orders are similar to limit orders in that they let you set a
price you want to buy or sell shares at. They have a very important
difference, though, that addresses some of the shortcomings of limit
orders. When a stock hits the price you designed, the order converts
into a market order and executes immediately.
127
Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades

Imagine again that you have 100 shares of ABC, which are trading for $50
a share. But this time, you enter a stop market order for $45. And again,
you wake up to find the stock plunged instantly to $25. This time,
though, all your stock would have been sold. But, maybe not at $45.
Your online broker will sell the shares at whatever the price was the
moment your order converted to a market order, which in this case
could have been $25.
 Stop limit orders are like stop market orders, but they’re designed to
cure the danger your shares will be blindly unloaded when a stock is
moving. Stop limit orders are very customizable. First, you can set the
activation price. When the activation price is hit, the order turns into a
limit order with the limit price you’ve set. 
Okay, ABC is trading for $50 a share when you enter a stop limit order
with an activation price of $45 and a limit price of $35. It would work like
this: Again, you wake up to find the stock plunged instantly to $25. This
time, your broker would turn your order into a limit order after it fell
below $45. When the stock fell to $35, the broker would try to fill orders at
that price if possible. Most likely, though, you’d still be stuck with shares.
But unlike with the stop market order, you would not dump the 
shares when they fell as low as $25. 
 Trailing stops are a way to keep up with the times. With regular limit
orders, they’re either executed or they expire. Trailing stop orders get
around this problem by letting you tell your broker to sell a stock if it
falls by a certain number of points or a percentage.
If you’re buying and selling individual stocks, trailing stops can be a
good idea. Even before you buy a stock, you should have an idea of how
far you’ll let it fall before you cut your losses. Some investment profes-
sionals suggest never letting a stock fall more than 10% below the price
you paid. If this sounds like a good idea to you, a trailing stop could
work for you.
Costs of different orders
Market orders are the most straightforward orders, so it shouldn’t be that
surprising that they’re also usually the least expensive.
Some brokers charge extra for limit orders, so check the commission fees
before you start trading. And some brokers, such as Buyandhold.com, don’t
offer limit orders.
128
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

Tailoring your trades even more
When you enter an order for a stock, you have a few other levers you can
pull, including
 Designating lots: Many people buy the same stock many times. Each
time you buy, that bundle of stock is called a lot. When you sell, your
broker will assume you’d like to sell the lot that you’ve held for the
longest time for recordkeeping purposes. This method, called first in,
first out, or FIFO, is the standard and what the Internal Revenue Service
expects. If, for tax reasons, you’d like to sell a specific lot that’s not the
oldest, you can tell your broker which lot you’d like to sell.
 Setting time frames: You can enter an order for a stock that is active
only the day you place the trade. If it’s not filled — perhaps a limit order
for the price you ask for isn’t reached — the order expires. That is called
day only. You can also enter orders and let them stay active until you
cancel them. That is called good till canceled. Good-till-canceled orders
are generally active for up to six months after you enter the order, but
that limit varies for each broker.
 Placing rules: When you issue an “all or none” restriction on your trade,
your broker must completely fill the order or not fill it at all. Say you
want to sell 100 shares of stock at a limit price of $45, but the broker can
find buyers only for 10 shares at that price. If you stipulated all or none,
none of your 100 shares will be sold.
Going off the Beaten Path with
Different Trading Techniques
If all you could do was buy and sell investments, traders would get awfully
bored. Investors looking for a little more excitement can dabble with some
more advanced ways to enter online trades that go beyond everything I have
discussed in this chapter so far. The most common ways to get a little fancier
with your trades are
 Selling stock short: A way to make money even if a stock declines in value.
 Buying stock on margin: This method lets you bet big on a stock you
think will go up. You borrow money to buy stock, which will magnify
your returns if it rises.
 Trading after hours: Perfect for night-owl investors who aren’t satisfied
with the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST regular trading hours of the NYSE and
NASDAQ.

Cashing in when stocks fall: 
Selling stock short
Most investors are pretty optimistic folks. When they go to a restaurant, see
long lines, and enjoy the food, they rush home to buy stock in the company
that owns the restaurant. These types of investors, who hope to profit from a
company’s good times and rising profits, are called longs.
But there’s a whole other class of investors, called shorts, who do just the
opposite. They search the Internet for news stories about diners getting food
poisoning at a restaurant, for instance, and look for ways to cash in on the
stock falling.
Investors looking to short a stock do it through four steps:
1. They borrow the stock they want to bet against.
Short sellers contact their brokers to find shares of the stock they think
will go down and they request to borrow the shares. The broker then
locates another investor who owns the shares and borrows them with a
promise to return the shares at a prearranged later date. The shares are
then given to the short seller.
2. They immediately sell the shares they’ve borrowed.
The short sellers then pocket the cash from the sale.
3. They wait for the stock to fall and then buy the shares back at the new,
lower price.
4. They return the shares to the brokerage they borrowed them from and
pocket the difference.
Here’s an example: Shares of ABC are trading for $40 a share, which you think
is way too high. You contact your broker, who finds 100 shares from another
investor and lets you borrow them. You sell the shares and pocket $4,000. Two
weeks later, the company reports its CEO has been stealing money and the
stock falls to $25 a share. You buy 100 shares of ABC for $2,500, give the shares
back to the brokerage you borrowed them from and pocket a $1,500 profit.
When you short a stock, there are some extra costs to be aware of. Most
brokerages, for instance, charge fees or interest to borrow the stock. Also, if
the company pays a dividend between the time you borrowed the stock and
when you returned it, you must pay the dividend out of your pocket. You’re
responsible for the dividend payment, even if you already sold the stock and
didn’t receive it.

Tracking the short sellers
You might be interested to find out how many investors are shorting a stock
you own, a statistic known as short interest. Some investors even incorporate
tracking short interest in their strategies by seeking stocks that are heavily
shorted, on the theory if the shorts are wrong the stock might surge higher in
a short squeeze. A short squeeze is what happens when the short sellers get
nervous that a stock they’re betting against will rise and they rush out and
buy the stock back so they can return it to the brokers they borrow from.
Exchanges release short interest data on stocks on the third Monday of each
month. You can easily get the data online. A helpful source I’ve found is
NASDAQ.com, shown in Figure 5-1. You can look up the level of short interest
on almost every stock, including those that trade on other exchanges such as
the New York Stock Exchange. Here how:
1. Point your browser to www.nasdaq.com.
2. Enter the stock’s symbol in one of the blank spaces beneath the Get
Up to 10 Quotes heading. Click the silver Info Quotes button underneath
the blanks.

Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades

3. Choose Short Interest from the leftmost drop-down menu.
You see a detailed list showing you the number of shares being shorted,
as shown in Figure 5-1. That number in itself doesn’t tell you much because
different companies have different numbers of shares trading, or shares
outstanding. So, to put the level of short interest in perspective, you also
see the average daily share volume — the number of shares that usually
trade hands in a given day. Lastly, you see days to cover, which is the
number of days it would take, on average, for the number of shares that
are being shorted to trade. Days to cover is calculated by dividing the
number of shares shorted by the average daily share volume. The
bottom line? The higher the days to cover, the greater the amount of real
short interest in the stock.
Living on borrowed time: 
Buying stock on margin
The standard brokerage account is called a cash account. That’s where you
deposit cold hard cash with the broker and use that pooled money to buy
stocks. But when you set up your account, as described in Chapter 4, you can
also request a margin account. This is an account type that lets you borrow
money you can use to buy stocks.
Buying stock on margin isn’t for the faint of heart. Remember, if you borrow
money, you must not only pay interest on that cash but also pay back the
money you borrowed even if the stock goes down. Buying on margin is gener-
ally a good idea only if you’re a highly risk-tolerant investor. You can determine
your taste for risk by reading Chapter 1.
As is the case anytime you borrow to invest, buying stock on margin can
boost your profit when you’re right and sting badly when you’re wrong.
When you buy a stock that goes up, using margin, you can boost your
returns. But if you bet wrong and buy one that goes down, margin magnifies
your loss. To understand why, take a look at the following example:
Imagine buying 100 shares of a stock that goes from $15 a share to $32 a
share. Your investment of $1,500 turns into $3,200. Assuming you paid a $5
commission to buy and sell the stock, your rate of return, as explained in
Chapter 1, is 112.3%, and your profit is $1,690.
It’s calculated like this:
1. Subtract the commission of $5 from the sale proceeds of $3,200. Write
this down.
2. Add the commission of $5 to the amount paid of $1,500. Write this down.
3. Subtract the answer in Step 2 from the answer in Step 1 and divide
that answer by the answer in Step 2. Multiply by 100.
132
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 

That’s not bad. But if you bought on margin, your return would be even
greater. Here’s what I mean. Say your broker has a 60% margin requirement,
meaning you must put up 60 cents of every $1 you invest. In this case, you’d
have to put up $900 of your own cash because that’s 60% of the $1,500 pur-
chase price. You then borrow the remaining $600 at 10% interest. Your gain,
thanks to margin, goes from 112.3% to 180%.
Here’s how your rate of return when using margin is calculated, using the
facts above as an example:
1. Subtract the commission of $5 from the sale proceeds of $3,200.
Write this down, $3,195.
2. Add the commission of $5 to the amount paid of $1,500.
Write this down, $1,505.
3. Multiply the amount you borrowed, $600, by 0.10 to calculate the
interest you owe.
You use 0.1 because that is 10% converted from percentage form. You
get $60.
4. Subtract the answer from Step 2 from the answer from Step 1.
Subtract that difference by the answer from step 3. You get $1,630.
5. Divide the answer from Step 4 by $905, which is the amount of your
own money you put up plus the commission you paid to buy the stock.
Multiply by 100. The answer is 180.1%
If the preceding is too much math for you, do it online. Most online brokers’
sites calculate your margin requirements. If you’re interested in buying on
margin, be sure to make sure the broker has margin-tracking capabilities.
Figure 5-2 shows Fidelity’s Margin Calculator.
The call you don’t want to get: 
The margin call
Most online brokers require investors to maintain a certain percentage of
ownership of stocks relative to what has been borrowed. This is called the
maintenance margin, and it’s typically 30% at most firms. If a stock rises, this
isn’t a problem because the value of the loan becomes a smaller slice of the
position. But if the stock falls in value, the shareholder’s stake shrinks. If it
falls below 30%, the broker requires the investor to put up more cash, or the
shares will be sold.
133
Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades

Imagine that, when you bought the $15-a-share stock above, you borrowed
40% or $6 a share, meaning your ownership stake is $9 a share or 60%. But
say the stock falls to $7 a share. Because you borrowed $6 a share, you own
only $1 of the $7 a share price. That means you own just 14% of the stock,
violating the 30% margin requirement.

The nightshift: Trading 
in the extended hours
One of the great things about stocks and bonds is they’re easy to sell. Unlike
real estate, which usually requires hiring a realtor who sprinkles air freshener
through the house and invites prospective buyers to an open house, you can
sell stocks pretty much instantly. The main stock exchanges are open every
business day, for regular trading hours, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
But thanks to ECNs, discussed above, you can trade before 9:30 a.m. in what’s
called premarket trading and after 4 p.m. in after-hours trading. Here are sev-
eral reasons why some investors pay attention to after-hours trading:
 A chance to react to late-breaking news: Some active traders believe they
can use after-hours trading as a way to profit from news companies that
might report after the close. It’s common for companies to release important
information, either good or bad, after 4 p.m. to give investors time to
digest. But investors don’t have to wait and can place trades after hours.
 An indication of how late-breaking news might affect the stock when
regular trading hours begin: You don’t have to be a high-profile online
trader to get access to after-hours quotes. Most online financial Web
sites discussed in Chapter 2, including Yahoo! Finance (http://
finance.yahoo.com) and MSN Money (http://moneycentral.
msn.com/investor/home.asp), let you see how stocks and indexes
are trading in the after hours. Both of those sites — as well as Google
Finance (http://finance.google.com) — also show you the after-
hours volume, which is the number of shares trading hands. Volume is
very important when looking at after-hours trading because the more
shares trading hands, the more reliable the price is.
Trading after hours isn’t a good idea for most online investors for several
reasons:
 Lower participation: Fewer buyers and sellers participate in after-hours
trading, so there’s a chance you’ll get a lower price for a stock you’re
selling or pay more for a stock you’re buying than had you waited for
regular trading to begin. After-hours trading attracts very little interest,
as Table 5-1 shows. Only about 1% of the trades placed each day on the
NYSE are conducted after hours.
 Limit orders are required: Most online brokers accept after-hours trades
only if they’re entered as limit orders. Limit orders present their own
shortcomings, as explained in the “Types of orders” section, earlier in
the chapter.
 Unpredictable pricing: Sometimes stock prices set in the after hours aren’t
necessarily harbingers for how things will open the next day. They can be 
a poor indicator of the next day’s trading if the after-hours volume is low.

Knowing Your Options: Basic 
Ways to Best Use Options
If you’ve ever put down a deposit so someone would hold something for you,
you know what an option is. For instance, you might pay a landlord a $100
nonrefundable deposit to hold an apartment so that it’ll be available for you
if you decide to rent it. If you don’t rent the apartment, you’re out the $100.
Options are the financial version of that idea. If you own an option, you have
the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an investment, including shares
of stock by a certain preset time in the future. Options can be extremely
powerful in the right hands, and they can either help you boost your returns
or reduce your risk depending on how you use them.
I often describe options as the financial version of dynamite. If used pru-
dently and safely, options can remove perils in the way of your financial
goals. But if abused, misunderstood, or used recklessly, options can blow
your financial plan to smithereens.
When you own an option, you have the power to make someone follow
through on a trade for an underlying asset, such as a stock, no matter what
happens to the price. Options expire on the third Friday of every month.
Need an example? Say ABC stock is currently trading for $30 a share, and you
own an option to buy it for $20 a share on its expiration date in one month.
That option is worth $10 a share, the difference between $30 and $20, which
is its intrinsic value. If you own an option like this that lets you buy a stock for
less than its current value, it’s in the money. But if the price you can buy the
stock at, known as the exercise price, is higher than the current price, the
option is out of the money.
136

The different types of options
Option strategies can get pretty complex. If you’re serious about trading them,
you can find out all the gory details in Future & Options For Dummies, by Joe
Duarte (Wiley Publishing). But I’m perfectly willing to give you the basics.
Two types of options exist:
 Calls give their owners the right to buy a stock at a certain price (called
the exercise or strike price) at a certain time (called the expiration date)
in the future. One call contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares of
the underlying stock. 
 Puts give their owners the right to sell a stock at a certain price at a certain
time in the future. One put contract gives you the right to sell 100 shares
of the underlying stock.
Basic options strategies
The real beauty of both call and put options kicks in because you can either
buy or sell them to other investors. That gives you four distinct strategies: 
 Buying a call: When you buy a call, you have the right to force someone
to sell you the stock at the exercise price you agreed upon ahead of
time. You make money on a call when the stock price rises above the
exercise price. This strategy is for investors that are convinced a stock
will rise and want to bet big. Buying a call isn’t free. You must pay the
seller for the option, in what’s called the premium.
Nothing says you must exercise an option. But, not exercising an option
that’s worth something would be foolish. So foolish, in fact, that most
online brokers will automatically exercise options that are worth some-
thing, or in the money.
 Selling a call: When you sell a call, you’re on the other side of the option
strategy of buying a call. You get paid the premium and pocket the
money. And it gets better; if the stock falls, you keep that money free and
clear. But if the stock rises, you’re in trouble because you’ve agreed to
sell the stock for the lower price. If you don’t already own the stock,
you’re what’s called naked. That means you’ll have to go out and buy the
stock you’ve already sold, no matter the price.
You should never sell a call unless you know what you’re doing. If you
sell a call and don’t own the underlying stock, that’s called writing a
naked call. If the stock rises, your losses are unlimited because in theory
the stock could rise hundreds of points.
137
Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades

If a call sounds like something you’d like to trade, here are places online
where you can find out more:
• The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Options Institute (http://
cboe.com/LearnCenter/cboeeducation/Course_01_02/
mod_02_01.aspx)
• Optionetics
(www.optionetics.com/education/basic/call.asp)
 Buying a put: When you buy a put, you have the right to make someone
buy a stock from you for a prearranged price. You’re betting that the price
of the underlying stock will fall. And like buying a call, it lets you make a
big gamble with little upfront money. It’s another way to bet against a
stock, similar to shorting a stock, as described earlier in this chapter.
 Selling a put: This strategy places you on the other side of the person
who is buying the put. When you sell a put, you’re usually betting the
price of the underlying stock will rise. But you might also sell a put if
you’re willing to buy the stock at the current price but think it might go
lower in the short term. That way, if the stock does fall, you must buy
the stock at the higher exercise price but get to keep the premium.
Selling a put can be extremely risky. If the stock falls, you keep losing
money until it hits $0. Don’t sell a put unless you know exactly what
you’re doing. Some online resources can help:
• The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Options Institute (http://
cboe.com/LearnCenter/cboeeducation/Course_03_01/mod_
01_01.aspx) has a special section dedicated to selling put.
• Optionetics (www.optionetics.com/education/basic/put.asp)

How to get option prices online
Most of the leading stock quote sites provide options prices. They’re usually
called options chains because they show data on options for many exercise
prices and for different expiration dates. Two helpful places to get options
chains are NASDAQ.com (www.nasdaq.com) and Yahoo! Finance
(http://finance.yahoo.com). Options quotes are also provided by most
online brokers.
No matter where you look up options chains online, most providers will give
you a chart with the same basic information, including
 Premiums (or prices) of both call and put options at all price levels:
The bid is how much you will get for selling the option and the ask is
how much you’d pay to buy one.
 Volume: This shows you have many contracts are being bought and sold.
 In the money and out of the money: You can see which options are in
the money or which are out of the money. Remember, a call option is in
the money if the stock price is higher than the option’s strike price. A
call option is out of the money if the strike price is higher than the
stock’s price.
139
Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
Buying trouble by buying calls
Buying calls is the best way to maximize returns
if a stock is about to go up. And that’s why
they’re perfect tools for investors who use 
illegal insider information about stocks for 
personal gain. Illegal insider information is
important information the public doesn’t know
about yet but will move the stock when the
news gets out. It’s illegal to trade using impor-
tant and confidential information you got from
working for a company or being connected to
people with such secret information. For just a
little cash, these investors can post giant gains
when the market-moving news — news they
already know about — hits the market. 
Regulators are aware of this, too, though.
Options activity is one of the first things the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
looks into following a big move of a stock, 
especially on news that a company is being
acquired. A classic case came in August 2005,
when the SEC uncovered a ring of nine investors
who allegedly made more than $6 million in ille-
gal profits largely by buying call options ahead
of the August 3rd announcement that athletic
apparel maker Adidas was buying Reebok. The
case included lurid details of the illegal traders
meeting with an exotic dancer to exchange 
tips as well as secret meetings inside Russian
spas. A few members of the ring worked for
investment banks and knew the deal was
coming, giving them time to make the options
trades. You can read all about it in one of 
the SEC’s complaints at http://sec.gov/
litigation/complaints/2006/comp
19775.pdf.

 Prices for different dates: You can see how much options with different
expiration dates are trading for.
 The trading symbol of the option: Options have five-letter symbols. The
first three letters represent the stock. (Sometimes it’s the same as the
stock ticker symbol, but not always.) The next two letters represent the
month the option expires and its exercise price. Nearly all the options
sites described in this chapter have a feature that will look up a symbol
for you. You can also find out about the symbols from Yahoo! Finance
(http://biz.yahoo.com/opt/symbol.html).
How to buy options online
Most of the mainstream online brokers allow you to buy and sell options.
Some of the brokers are specialists with options and can help you calculate
your gains and losses. Those specialty firms are listed in Chapter 4. You also
need to pay a commission to buy or sell options, just as you pay to buy or
sell stocks. The fees vary by broker. Table 5-3 lists a few examples.

$4.95 plus $0.65 per contract
TD AMERITRADE
$9.99 plus $0.75 per contract
Scottrade
$7 plus $1.25 per contract
Entering an option order is very similar to placing a trade for a stock. You
must follow these steps: 
1. Go to the option-trading section of the online broker’s site.
2. Enter an order to buy or sell a call or put option. 
3. Enter the number of contracts you want to trade. 
One options contract controls 100 shares of the stock.
4. Enter the option contract symbol. 
5. Select an order type, such as a limit or market order.
For more on limit and market orders, see the “Types of orders” section,
earlier in the chapter.

Discovering more about options online
Options aren’t complicated, but they can be a little bewildering to novices.
You need to make absolutely certain you know what you’re doing before
trying to play with options. These online resources can help: 
 Your broker’s Web site: Most brokers have an education section, where
options are explained in detail. Brokerages that specialize on options, like
TradeKing (www.tradeking.com), have very comprehensive tutorial
information.
 The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Options Institute:
(http://cboe.com/LearnCenter/OptionsInstitute1.aspx)
Online tutorials, courses, and educational Webcasts will step you
through the options process before you risk inflicting some major
damage on your portfolio. You can see how the CBOE explains put
options in Figure 5-3.
 The International Securities Exchange: (www.ise.com) This options
exchange provides great options tutorials. Just click the Resource Center
tab on the left side of the screen. From the Resource Center page, select

Insurance to protect you from losing 
money investing online
You can buy insurance to cover you in case your
house burns down or your car is stolen. But
what about your online stock portfolio? Can you
buy insurance to protect yourself from losing a
catastrophic amount of money from investing
online? Yes, you can, but instead of buying a
policy from an insurance company, you can buy
a put option.
Buying a put is normally a way to bet against a
stock. But if you buy a put for a stock you
already own, you have what’s called a protec-
tive put. Say you own 100 shares of ABC. The
stock is trading for $30 a share, and you’re wor-
ried about a market meltdown. You can buy a
put that would give you the right to sell ABC for
$30. Even if the stock crashes and falls to $15 a
share, you can still sell it for $30. You’ve essen-
tially bought catastrophic insurance.

nvestors often wonder why bad things can happen to shares of “good
companies.” It’s common for a company to report seemingly solid news,
like sharply higher profit, and its stock will fall anyway. It doesn’t seem right
to many investors. This chapter answers the burning question you and many
investors might have: “Why do stocks rise and fall?” It’s a two-part answer
because one set of forces causes stocks to move in the short term, and
another set influences stock prices in the long term. I explain what moves
stocks and show you online tools that can help you track market-moving
events. 
How Stocks Get into the Public’s Hands
If you’ve ever seen the screen of a stock trader’s computer, on most days, it
looks like a Christmas tree. Ticker symbols are flashing red and green, indi-
cating that stock prices are moving up and down during the day. But why are
the stocks moving up and down so much? To understand that, it’s helpful to
see how and why companies decide to sell stock to the public, allowing you
to become an online investor. The following sections take a look at how the
process works. 

Step 1: An idea becomes a company
Clever entrepreneurs with an idea for a product or service form a company.
Young companies usually pay for the equipment and materials they need 
by using private money. Let me clarify: They use their money. But, if it’s a
promising concept that could sell on Wall Street, the entrepreneurs might hit
up venture capital (VC) investors for cash. VCs are specialized investors who
buy stakes in very young companies, most of which will fail, on the hope they
hit just one future Microsoft or Google and make a bundle. You can track
trends in the VC industry at The National Venture Capital Association (www.
nvca.org) and PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ MoneyTree Report (www.pwc
moneytree.com). 
When a company finally sells its shares to the public in an initial public 
offering, you can see which VC firms were investors in the prospectus. The
prospectus is a legal document that explains everything about the company
selling shares to the public. You can find out how to access an IPO’s prospec-
tus in Bonus Chapter 2 on the Web site associated with this book.
Step 2: The company expands and grows
If the entrepreneur’s hunch is right and there’s a demand for what the com-
pany sells, the business takes off. At this point, the company needs more
money to grow. The company might remain private by finding large institu-
tional investors, like pension funds, insurance companies or companies that
invest in private companies. These private placement investments aren’t typi-
cally open to online investors. Private placements are very selective sales of
investments to a small and savvy group of money managers, such as pension
funds or insurance companies. But if you’re interested, you can more find out
about them here:
 Drew Field Direct Public Offerings (www.dfdpo.com) is trying to 
allow more regular people to invest in private companies. Some private
companies choose to raise money through Direct Public Offerings (also
known as DPOs) so they can sell their private stock to their customers,
who will be more patient than Wall Street. 
Although some direct public offerings might work out, they’re highly
risky and are only for investors willing to lose their entire investment. 
 Private Placement Letter (www.privateplacementletter.com) pro-
vides information about private placement investments in case you want
to track them. Most of the information concerns bonds that companies
sell to private investors. I discuss how to invest in bonds online in detail
in Chapter 16.
146
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

For an overview of this stage of the process, check out a speech made by Laura
Unger, the former acting head of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
available on the Web at www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch471.htm. Her
speech describes all the ways companies raise money at this stage — as well
as the related dangers associated with such schemes for raising cash.
Step 3: The company goes public
To raise money, the company sells a fraction of itself in an Initial Public
Offering or IPO. The shares are first sold mostly to large institutional
investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and investment banks at the
IPO price. When the large institutions and other initial investors sell their
shares, they’re available for you to buy online. I cover IPOs in more detail in
Bonus Chapter 2 on the Web site associated with this book, but great places
to start researching IPOs include
 Renaissance Capital’s IPOhome (www.ipohome.com) maintains all
sorts of statistics about IPOs, ranging from how many there are to how
well they do. You can also find research about upcoming IPOs and read
their prospectuses.
 Gaskins IPO desktop (http://gaskinsco.com), which provides
detailed information on the types of companies that are coming public
as well as links to expert commentary on the deals.
Step 4: The new shares trade
After the IPO shares get into the hands of investors, the investors are free to
buy and sell them at will on the exchanges. If you have a broker, as described
in Chapter 4, you’re free to participate and bid for stocks you want to buy.
After you buy, you can sell.
This constant buying and selling of shares creates a dynamic way to deter-
mine stock prices. The process of how shares trade hands on the exchanges
is described at length in Chapter 5.
Why Stocks Move Up and 
Down in the Short Term
Shares of large companies generally gain about 10% a year on average, as
explained in Chapter 1. But getting there is far from a smooth ride. The ups
147
Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

and downs can be vicious as investors react to different news and corporate
developments that trickle out randomly.
Stock prices are volatile in the short term because investors can either worry
about or get excited about countless things. Stock prices reflect what investors
know and expect from the company. But stock prices change the second
there’s a bit of unexpected news that changes investors’ outlook for the
stock. Investors instantly react to any news about the company, including 
the following:
 Movement by the rest of the stock market: If the entire market goes up
or down, most stocks move in the same direction. 
 Earnings reports: Such reports are released quarterly by companies to
give investors a status report on the business. Investors usually react
quickly and intensely to these reports.
 Industry developments: What’s happening to the industry as a whole
can affect every company in the field. If one company, for instance, cre-
ates a new product that makes rivals’ offerings obsolete, there can be a
swift reaction.
 Management changes: Who gets hired and fired at the top can be criti-
cal because such moves might signal a turn in the company’s direction
or a power struggle in the executive suite.
 Raw materials: Changes in the price of raw materials can significantly
affect companies that must buy basic ingredients to make their prod-
ucts. Higher raw material costs must be passed on to the company’s
consumer, or profit will suffer.
 Trading momentum: When a certain stock gets its mojo going, it might
seem as if there’s no stopping it. Many times, companies become dar-
lings with investors and can enjoy big rallies as everyone piles in.
 Merger chatter: When the buzz tells you that a corporate wedding is in
the offing, that can be market-moving information because companies
are usually bought out for a premium to the existing share price. 
 Bond yields: The yield on bonds determines how much stocks are
worth to investors, so a move in yields has a swift effect on stocks.
 Economic reports: Official pronouncements about the state of the econ-
omy, including changes in short-term interest rates by the Fed, help
investors decide whether they want to own stocks at the time.
 Legal insider buying or selling: When corporate executives are doing a
lot of buying or selling of their company’s stock, that’s worth watching
closely. When the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) is buying, for
example, investors assume he knows what he’s doing and might want to
go along for the ride. (Don’t confuse legal insider trading with illegal
148
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

insider selling, discussed in Chapter 5. Illegal insider trading occurs
when anyone with special connections to the company, including the
management, use important information not known by the public to
unfairly make a profit.)
The preceding list just gives you a taste of all the things that can cause a
stock that you own to go up or down. In the following sections, I expand on a
few of these things and show you places online where you can track them
insofar as they pertain to investments in your portfolio.
Tracking the market’s every move
Perhaps the biggest factor on the short-term moves of stocks is the direction
of the broader market. Investors generally watch stock market indexes —
tools that track a basket of stocks — to find out what the market is doing.
Popular indexes include the Dow Jones industrial average, Standard & Poor’s
500, and the NASDAQ composite index. You can find out how to track these
indexes online in Chapter 2. Monitoring the broad market is telling because
when market indexes are falling, it’s not uncommon for investors to dump all
stocks, including those of companies that are doing well. Traders describe
this phenomenon with an old cliché: “Investors are throwing the baby out
with the bathwater.”
Getting in tune with earnings reports
Your stock’s ultimate value will be determined by how profitable the com-
pany is in the long term. But even the best market forecasters are unable to
measure a company’s profits 10 years in the future, much less in 20 years. So,
investors tend to overcompensate for their lack of long-term vision by focus-
ing on how companies are doing in the short-term. Earnings reports tell you
how much the company made during the quarter. Earnings reports also con-
tain all the vital financial results for the quarter, including the net income (or
total profit) as well as earnings per share, which is how much of the com-
pany’s profit you can lay claim to as a shareholder.
Investors and online databases usually use the shorthand term EPS when
referring to earnings per share. If you see the abbreviation, EPS TTM, that
means earnings per share over the trailing, or past, 12 months.
All public companies that trade on major exchanges, such as the New York
Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, are required to tell investors how they did
during the quarter. These earnings reports can be incredibly important to
investors in the short term. But stocks that trade on other markets, including
149
Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

the Pink Sheets, are often not required to make these important disclosures,
adding a great deal of risk if you choose to invest in them. You can read more
about the risks of investing in stocks listed on the Pink Sheets in Chapter 2.
Getting the goods
Here are several ways to get your hands on earnings reports the second
they’re released:
 Financial news Web sites: Nearly all the financial news sites described
in Chapter 2, including Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com)
and USA TODAY (http://money.usatoday.com) provide the earnings
reports directly from the companies as soon as they’re published.
Earnings releases are easy to find because in the list of news stories
they’re usually tagged as being from one of two sources: PR Newswire
(http://prnewswire.com) or Business Wire (http://home.
businesswire.com). These reports are very formal and written in
almost legalese language. They describe how the companies did, in
exhaustive detail, and provide the quarterly financial statements. (I
cover how to analyze financial statements in more detail in Chapter 12.)
If you don’t want to take the time to pick apart the company releases,
look for earnings stories written by the wire services, such as Reuters
and The Associated Press. These stories are analyzed by reporters
trained to look for the important things and put their findings in plain
English. Wire stories are also available on most financial news sites.
 Press release distribution services: Most companies hire one of two
companies — either the PR Newswire outfit or the Business Wire outfit,
mentioned in the preceding bullet — to electronically distribute their
earnings press releases. Both these sites let you search press releases
that might have been released by different companies.
 The regulators: You can get earnings reports, called 10-Qs, directly from
the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov). The 10-Qs are
the official reports, so they usually take a few days to be released. Prior
to that, the company must file an 8-K report stating that it put out a
press release with quarterly earnings information. If you’re interested in
getting the information this way, I show you how to do that in Chapter 2.
 Earnings calendars: Earnings calendars like the one maintained by
BigCharts (www.bigcharts.com) let you see what companies have
reported their earnings most recently. In the case of BigCharts, just click
the BigReports tab on the site’s home page and then click the NYSE,
AMEX, or NASDAQ link for the Most Recent Corporate Earnings Releases
row, and you can find out who’s reporting. (Figure 6-1 shows you what
the report for the NYSE looks like.) And if you want to find out what
companies are scheduled to report earnings when, go to Yahoo!
Finance’s earnings calendar at http://biz.yahoo.com/research/

Stocks often react immediately to the release of earnings statements by com-
panies. However, you might be surprised at the counterintuitive reactions
such news sometimes provokes. This can be one of the greatest riddles on
Wall Street, and it reveals just how deeply investors pick apart everything a
company says to determine the price of the stock. Oftentimes, a company
will release sharply higher earnings, but the stock will fall. Pure perversity?
An Alice-in-Wonderland kind of world? Not necessarily. It’s just a complicated
world, as the next section makes clear. (Hey, if it were easy, everybody would
be rich.)
What’s so important about earnings reports?
To get into the head of short-term investors and understand how they read
quarterly earnings statements, ask yourself the following questions: 
 Were the company’s results better than expected? When a company
releases its earnings per share, investors instantly compare those
results to what Wall Street analysts who follow the stock expected. Even
if a company’s EPS is just a penny short of expectations, the stock can
get punished. But the stock can fall even if earnings per share is up, if it’s
not up as much as analysts expected. How do you find out how much
the analysts thought the company would earn?
• Financial wire stories: Most of the wire stories from financial Web
sites contain how figures on much analysts were expecting and
how the actual results compared with said expectations.

Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

• NASDAQ’s Stock Research – Earnings Per Share: (http://
quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/MasterDataEntry.asp?page=
analystinfo) Here you can see how much analysts were expect-
ing the company to earn and whether the actual results were a 
positive surprise or a negative surprise. Yahoo! Finance also has 
an entire section dedicated to tracking the analysts. Just enter the
stock’s ticker symbol and click the Get Quotes button to get the
company’s summary information. Under the Analyst Coverage 
section on the left side of the page, click the Analyst Opinion and
Analyst Estimates links.
When looking up analysts’ expectations for earnings, be sure to find out
how many analysts cover the stock and how many have provided an
earnings estimate. If three or more analysts are on the stock, the esti-
mate is more meaningful than if there’s only one.
 What did the company say about the future? What the company says
about the just-completed quarter is practically ancient history. Investors
spent all quarter anticipating the results and are usually pretty close.
But sometimes a company drops a bomb in its press release regarding
what it expects in the future. Usually, though, companies make comments
about the future in so-called investor conference calls — scheduled tele-
conferences between Wall Street analysts and other investors with the
company’s top brass, where management discusses how the quarter
went and what it expects to happen in the future.
You’re not likely to be on the To Call list for such investor conference
calls, but you can still get the highlights from these calls from wire sto-
ries or earnings news stories. And, if you’re really curious, you can often
access such investor conference calls yourself online from a variety of
sources, including
• The company’s Web site: Start here. There’s usually an Investor
Relations link you can use to access the feed for earnings calls.
Most companies let you click a link to hear the calls as they’re
being made, and many rebroadcast the call for 24 hours after it
occurred.
• Financial news sites: The major sites provide calendars of upcom-
ing conference calls as well as the audio broadcasts from the calls
themselves. Yahoo! Finance (http://biz.yahoo.com/cc) pro-
vides a calendar of company conference calls and lets you listen 
to some as they’re ongoing and some that are over. Briefing.com
(www.briefing.com/Investor/Private/Calendars/Earnings
ConferenceCallListingByCompany.htm) and Earnings.com
(http://earnings.com) provide similar services.

 Are analysts changing their opinions on the company? The minute a
company releases earnings, Wall Street analysts are already picking the
results apart. They’re looking for anything that changes their expecta-
tions for the company. Analysts publish their opinions on stocks in ana-
lyst reports, which I show you how to read and interpret in Chapter 15.
But, for quick ways to find out whether analysts are changing their
expectations, here are some sources: 
• Zacks Investment Research (www.zacks.com) closely tracks ana-
lysts’ opinions of stocks. If analysts change their opinion on a
stock, you can find out immediately. Zacks helps you keep tabs on
the analysts and closely track analyst revisions, which occur when
researchers either increase or decrease their expectations for
earnings. 
From the Zacks Investment Research home page, just enter the
stock’s symbol and scroll down to the section called Brokerage
Recommendations. The Current ABR number is the average broker
recommendation. This number averages all the recommendations
made by the Wall Street analysts. A current ABR of 5 means all the
analysts covering the stock give it a “strong buy” rating, whereas
an ABR of 1 means the analysts give it a “sell.” A 3 means “hold.”
You can also see what the stock’s ABR was in the past so you can
tell whether analysts are getting more bullish or bearish. 
Zacks also provides a Zacks Rank, which scores stocks from a high
of 5 to a low of 1. But unlike the ABR number, which looks only at
analyst ratings, the Zacks Ranks considers four factors: How much
the analysts agree, how dramatically estimates have been increased
or cut, how quickly the average estimate is rising, and how much
the recent financials have differed from the estimate. 
You must subscribe to Zacks to get stocks’ Zacks Ranks, and it
costs $25 a month or $199 a year. However, you can access some of
the stocks with top Zacks Rank scores for free. 
• Reuters (http://today.reuters.com/investing/default
US.aspx) has a comprehensive database of analysts’ ratings on
stocks so you can see how Wall Street is reacting to an earnings
release. Just enter the stock symbol into the Enter Symbol text
field (you might have to scroll down a bit to find it) of the Reuters
Investing home page, choose the Estimates option below the text
field, and then click Go. You’re greeted by a page that lets you look
up what analysts have been expecting and also lets you track
whether the company has the tendency to beat estimates in the
past and by how much. You can view estimates for both revenue
and earnings. 
• Yahoo! Finance’s Upgrades Center (http://finance.yahoo.com/
marketupdate/upgrades) tells you what stocks are getting
higher ratings from the analysts that track them.
153
Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

• Briefing.com (http://briefing.com/Investor/Public/
Calendars/UpgradesDowngrades.htm) shows you what stocks
were downgraded by which analysts on what day.
In addition to tracking earnings reported by companies, it’s valuable to see
how earnings from all the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index are
coming in. S&P 500 earnings are closely watched by pros because it gives
them an idea of how healthy companies are. Standard & Poor’s (www2.
standardandpoors.com/spf/xls/index/SP500EPSEST.XLS) lets 
you see how much companies in the S&P 500 have earned each quarter for
decades and also how much the companies are expected to earn.
Companies and the company 
they keep in their industries
Sweeping changes in an industry can have a tremendous influence on all the
companies in it. A new product coming to the market can affect all the com-
panies in its industry. Apple’s iPod music player, for instance, shook up other
electronics companies, software companies, and music companies. Other
times, good news for one company, such as a change in regulation, can help
other players in the industry. If you’re interested in keeping up with industry
trends, here are several online sources: 
 Specialized boutique research firms: These guys closely track an indus-
try or a collection of related industries called a sector. These firms usu-
ally charge large sums for their research. Sometimes, though, they
provide useful industry data on their Web sites for free. You can usually
find them by searching for “research” and the name of the industry in
most search engines. Table 6-1 lists a few of the more prominent bou-
tique research firms. 
 Industry associations: Can you say “lobbyist”? Industry associations 
are usually groups paid by companies in the industry to represent them
on Capital Hill. So, they’re certainly biased in favor of the industry. Still,
most release helpful information that can tell you about industry trends.
Typically, the easiest way to find such groups is by just entering the name
of the industry and “association” into a search engine, as described in
Chapter 2, and see what that turns up. The online encyclopedia Wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_trade_group) keeps
a list of many industry groups. Table 6-2 lists a few of the larger industry
associations. 
 Pay services: Hoovers.com (http://premium.hoovers.com/
subscribe/ind/dir.xhtml) provides full reports on a wide range 
of industries to subscribers. Standard & Poor’s also publishes industry
154

surveys (www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/
page.category/equityresearch/2,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0.html), but be forewarned, they can cost hundreds of dollars. 
 The U.S. Government: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor
Statistics (http://stats.bls.gov/iag/iaghome.htm) maintains a
set of comprehensive industry data that’s free to the public.
 Competitor information: Sometimes the best way to find out about a
company is finding out what its rivals are saying about the industry. You
can hear what companies are saying about each other with a two-step
process online:
• Find the competitors. You can get Yahoo! Finance (http://
finance.yahoo.com) to display the main rivals of any company. 
Just enter the stock symbol of the company you’re interested in 
into the Enter Symbol(s) text field on the Yahoo! Finance home 
page and click the Get Quotes button. Next, click the Competitors 
option under the Company heading on the left side of the page.
Hoovers.com (www.hoovers.com) will also list a company’s 
top rivals.
You might also want to see which companies in the industry are
planning an IPO or recently have gone public. Regulatory filings
from newly public companies contain great details about the indus-
try. Renaissance Capital (www.ipohome.com/marketwatch/
priced.asp) provides a detailed list of recent IPOs and what
industry they are in.
• Find the competitors’ filings. Regulatory filings published by rivals
can be very revealing. Using the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion’s database, you can look up regulatory filings made by com-
petitors. The annual reports, labeled 10-Ks in the SEC database,
will usually have a section on the industry. And don’t miss the reg-
istration filings made by companies planning to go public, called 
S-1s. There’s usually excellent industry information in those.
(Chapter 2 tells you how to pull regulatory filings from the SEC’s
Web site.)
 BusinessWeek’s Sectors: (www.businessweek.com/investor/list/
main_sectors_toc01.htm) This venerable business magazine pub-
lishes data and commentary on market industries and sectors. It fea-
tures research by Sam Stovall, a Standard & Poor’s strategist known for
closely watching industry trends.
 ClearStation: (http://clearstation.etrade.com) This online
investment community/research hub — owned by E*Trade, the online
brokerage firm — has tons of information about how industries or
groups of industries (sectors) are doing relative to other industries and

Monitoring the big cheese
Investors usually have a strong reaction to management changes. Stocks
might fall when the chief financial officer (CFO) resigns because it might
make folks wonder whether the company’s books are okay. But the opposite
is also true — stocks might rise if a CEO who has worn out his welcome with
investors decides to ride off into the sunset. 
You can track management changes with the help of the following:
 Press releases: Such releases are required by regulators be put out the
moment a company announces a significant personnel change. The news
sources described in Chapter 2 all have this information.
 CEO Go: (http://ceogo.com) This Web site provides detailed data on
the comings and goings of corporate executives. You can get data on
CEO departures and pay, and you can even find out which CEOs have
the best reputations. 
 The Corporate Library: (www.thecorporatelibrary.com) This par-
ticular Web site closely tracks trends and data on executives. It has a
database, for instance, that can tell you which executives hobnob with
each other by sitting on corporate boards together. Most of the data,
though, must be paid for and the charges can vary.

Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

Where it all begins: Tracking 
prices of raw materials
Companies can make more money in two main ways: Either sell more products
or reduce costs. Most companies must buy certain raw materials including
commodities like coffee, copper or oil in order to make what they sell. When the
prices of these goods rise, that can be bad for their bottom lines. I have much
more on how commodities are traded online in Chapter 11, but for just check-
ing price information, you can track the pricing of key commodities at the f
ollowing sites: 
 The Chicago Board of Trade (www.cbot.com) maintains a list of prices
on everything from corn to soybeans, from oats to gold. The front page
of the Web site lists all the prices, and you can click them to get histori-
cal price changes. 
The CBOT has been acquired by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, also
described in this list, so it’ll be interesting to see whether the online
tools are merged, too.
 The New York Mercantile Exchange (www.nymex.com) is a great
resource for prices on many energy products such as oil, gas, and heat-
ing oil. Click the icon of the material you’re interested in to view the 
pricing. 
 Chicago Mercantile Exchange (www.cme.com) is home for the trading of
many financial instruments, making it a good place to see the prices of
different foreign currencies. But it’s also home to many agricultural prod-
uct trading, including pork bellies and live cattle. To see prices, click the
View All Delayed Quotes link on the right side of the home page.

Raw materials costs and that morning cuppa joe
Never underestimate how rising raw materials
costs can jolt a company. For instance, early in
Starbucks’ history, in June 1994, skyrocketing
coffee costs posed a grave danger to the com-
pany as it weighed how to handle the higher
costs. A more recent price shock came in
September 2004, after coffee and sugar prices
spiked more than 35% in a year’s time. Star-
bucks reacted by boosting prices by 3% for all
its drinks. It was the first time Starbucks had
raised prices since August 2000.

Getting with the mo’
Stocks, in the short term, often get what traders call momentum. There’s
always a handful of darling stocks that short-term speculators jump on due
to the fact they might have a hot product or simply because the stock is
going up. Some speculators try to jump into these stocks and hope they can
enjoy the ride higher and get out before the fall. The following sites highlight
these high-octane stocks:
 BigCharts.com: (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com) This site
has a BigReports tab that gives you access to all the stocks with the
biggest moves or those that are up the most or down the most over the
past year. You can also see the stocks with the most short interest. Short
interest is the number of shares being sold short by investors and is an
indictor of how many investors think the stock will go down. (Stock
shorting is described in Chapter 5.)
 USATODAY.com: (http://markets.usatoday.com/custom/usa
today-com/html-mktscreener.asp) This page of the USATODAY.
com site provides lists of stocks that have been actively trading. That
gives you an idea which stocks investors are making heavy bets on. It
can also show you which stocks you own in your portfolio are up the
most that day.
 Briefing.com: (www.briefing.com/Investor/Private/OurView/
IndustryInsight.htm) This page of the Briefing.com site indicates
which industries are investors’ current favorites and have the momen-
tum. It also breaks down details on other market-moving events that are
being followed by investors who attempt to make money by investing
based on stocks’ momentum.
Mania over merger chatter
It’s common for shares of a company being acquired to rise. That’s why
investors love trying to predict takeover candidates.
Trying to guess what companies are buyout bait is not a great way to make
money. Many of the merger and acquisition deals — M&A deals, for short —
investors expect to happen don’t happen, and in rare cases, companies’
shares can fall if investors expected a buyer to offer more.
Most of the leading trackers of merger activity, including Dealogic, Thomson
Financial, and FactSet Mergerstat, sell their data only to institutional
investors able to pay large sums. But some other places track merger activity,
including the following sites:
159
Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

 mergermarket: (www.mergermarket.com) These folks have compre-
hensive merger tracking information, ranging from scuttlebutt on what
companies are in play and some summary data about merger activity.
 FactSet Mergerstat (www.mergerstat.com) This Web site provides
some free data about the merger and acquisition market in its Press
Release area under the Press & Media tab on the front page. Its quarterly
updates are informative and give you an idea about the market.
 Yahoo! Finance: (http://biz.yahoo.com/topic/m-a) Count on
Yahoo! to summarize all its M&A news in one place.
Why bond yields aren’t boring
Stocks can be highly sensitive to changes in the yield on debt sold by the U.S.
government, called Treasuries. Investors keep a close eye on two types of
Treasuries: Treasury Notes that mature in ten years or less and Treasury Bills
that mature in less than a year. The yield on Treasuries is very important
because it indicates what return investors can expect in exchange for taking
no or low risk.
Stocks and Treasuries have an interesting relationship with each other. When
Treasury yields rise, stocks often suffer because there’s less impetus for
investors to risk money on stocks. I discuss the basics about tracking yields
online in Chapter 2 and give more advanced tips in Chapter 16. These sites
help show the relationship between Treasury yields and stocks:
 StockCharts.com: (http://stockcharts.com/charts/Yield
Curve.html) This page of the Web site has a Dynamic Yield Curve func-
tion, which shows you, graphically, how the yields for short-term
Treasuries, typically called bills, compare with yields for long-term
Treasuries, called notes and bonds. This graph is called the yield curve.
But more importantly, it plots the yield curve against the stock market
so you can understand the relationship between bond yields and stocks.
 Smart Money’s Living Yield Curve: (www.smartmoney.com/onebond/
index.cfm?story=yieldcurve) This site plots the yield curve but
also helps you understand it by explaining what it means if short-term
rates are higher, lower, or equal to long-term rates.

The heartbeat of the economy: 
Economic reports
If you can picture a patient at the hospital with probes and sensors on every
inch of his body, you get the idea of how closely investors monitor the health
of the economy. Investors are looking for any sign the economy is speeding
up, slowing down, or going sideways. They rapidly buy or sell stocks if their
opinion changes even a little. You can look in countless places for economic
indicators, but the key sites are 
 Conference Board: (www.conference-board.org) The Big Daddy of
economic prognosticators, the Conference Board, shown in Figure 6-3,
measures everything from manufacturing activity to unemployment
claims, from building permits to consumer confidence. Pay special atten-
tion to the U.S. leading index, which falls when the measures it monitors
predict an economic decline.
Although the Conference Board’s leading index is widely watched, it’s
not always right. Investment pros like to joke that the leading index has
predicted six of the last three recessions. For instance, the indicator fell
in 1984 and 1987, but the economy didn’t contract either time.
Figure 6-3:

Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

 U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics: (http://stats.
bls.gov) The U.S. Government is also in the predicting business, track-
ing a vast majority of the indicators investors focus on, including the 
following:
• The Consumer Price Index, which measures how much prices for
the things individuals buy are changing.
• The Producer Price Index, which tracks prices paid by companies
that create goods. When prices are rising, both bond and stock
investors pay attention because that affects the value of their
investments. Stock investors typically don’t like inflation because
it drives up costs and makes their investments worth less.
• Employee wages.
• Unemployment.
 U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis: (www.
bea.gov) More government predictors at work. The Bureau of
Economic Analysis monitors how fast the economy is growing, generally
using a measure called the Gross Domestic Product or GDP. You can also
look up how much individuals are spending on average, what personal
income levels are like, and how corporate profits are doing.
 The Federal Reserve Board: (www.federalreserve.gov) Investors
look long and hard at the Fed for two reasons. First, the Fed sets short-
term interest rates, which determines how much money is worth. Short-
term rates affect every aspect of the economy, from how fast it grows to
how much you have to pay to borrow money, and how you earn from
investments and savings. You can track the intended federal funds rate
here: www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm.
Don’t confuse short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates. The
Fed sets the short-term rates in order to steer the economy. When the
Fed wants to slow the economy, it tightens by raising short-term rates,
making it more expensive for companies and people to borrow and
spend. It can loosen credit by cutting short-term rates, which boosts the
economy. Long-term interest rates are set by traders who guess the
direction of the economy. The difference between short and long-term
rates is known as the spread.
The Fed publishes the Beige Book eight times a year. The Beige Book
indicates the nation’s economic health. You can view the results at www.
federalreserve.gov/FOMC/BeigeBook/2007.
 National Association of Realtors: (www.realtor.org) The fate of the
housing market has a major impact on the economy as a whole. The
National Association of Realtors’ Web site releases closely watched data
on both new- and existing-home sales, data investors can use to get a
better sense of the health of the economy as a whole.

tant economic reports. You can see which reports are coming up each
week, what they are, how important they are and what analysts are
expecting. It’s all in one place, too, saving you the trouble of bouncing
between all the sites in this list.
 Economics and Statistics Administration: (www.economicindicators.

nomic reports. You can access the calendar under the Calendar tab. The
site also has a free service where alerts of upcoming data releases will

What do they know that you don’t? 
Insider buying and selling
Some investors closely watch what the top officers and directors are doing
when deciding whether they should buy or sell a stock. This is legal insider
buying or selling, which is very different from the illegal insider trading
described in Chapter 5.
Investors assume that when officers of a company are buying the stock, it’s a
sign the company is doing well. Some investors get bearish on a stock when
executives are selling company stock.
When you see executives selling stock, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re
bailing out. Executives might sell stock to buy a home or to diversify their
holdings. Diversification offers great benefits to investors, as I describe in
Chapter 9, so it shouldn’t come as a big surprise if higher echelon types
diversify as well.
Nevertheless, major sell offs or a run on stocks by executives might actually
be saying something significant about the stock. If you’d like to track what
officers are doing, the following sites can help:
 NASDAQ’s Real-Time Institutional Holdings/Insider Ownership: (www.
nasdaq.com) You get to this page on the NASDAQ site by accessed by
entering a stock symbol in one of the Quotes text boxes, clicking
InfoQuotes and then choosing Holdings/Insider Summary from the
InfoQuotes drop-down menu on the new page that appears. You’ll get a
list of what all the big investors, including both officers, directors and
mutual funds are doing. The Insider Trades section shows how many
officers are buying or selling stock, how much and when. You can view
insider-trading data for stocks listed on the major exchanges, including
the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange.
163
Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall

 USATODAY.com: (http://money.usatoday.com) The USATODAY
Money page lets you overlay all the insiders’ buy and sell transactions
on the stock chart. That’s useful because you can see if the officers have
an uncanny ability to buy and sell at just the right time. Enter a stock
symbol into the Get a Quote text field (you might have to scroll down to
find it), click the Go button and then click the Insider Trading link above
the chart on the new page that appears for the full report.
 GradientAnalytics: (www.gradientanalytics.com) Gradient-
Analytics is a well-regarded research firm that looks at insider trading
with great precision. The reports it produces are sold only to large
investors and are very expensive. But the firm’s cofounder, Carr Bettis,
has described some of his techniques in an academic paper, Insider
Trading in Derivative Securities, available at http://papers.ssrn.
com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=167189.
Many market pros who track insider trading don’t get too interested if just 
a few executives are selling. After all, CEOs might want to sell stock for many
reasons such as for buying a house, diversifying their portfolios or sending a
kid to college. But if you see executives at many companies in an industry
dumping shares, you might want to take a closer look.
Knowing how investors are feeling:
Tracking market sentiment
The way investors are feeling about stocks at the moment can greatly influ-
ence the market’s movements in the short term. Typically, during a brutal
bear market, a period of time when stocks are falling in value, investors sour
on stocks and want nothing to do with them. 
When investors hate stocks, market sentiment is negative, and that can be a
good time to buy them because you’ll likely pay less. Investors who buy
stocks when they’re out of favor are called contrarians.
When stocks enter a bull market and start rising, more investors pile in and
push markets higher. Eventually, sentiment becomes overly positive, and
anyone who wanted to buy stock already has. When there’s a whiff of bad
news, these investors bail out and send stocks lower. That’s what happened
during the tech-stock boom in the late 1990s. And, as you might remember,
when investors were overly bullish in March 2000, that was a bad time to buy
stocks. 
A number of online tools can help you monitor sentiment:

investors because the higher the VIX, the more nervous investors are
about the stock market, as defined by the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.

 Investment Company Institute: (www.ici.org) This site tracks how
much money investors are putting into mutual funds. 
So what’s the big deal about mutual funds? It might seem insulting, but
Wall Street pros closely watch fund flows as a measure of what the
“dumb money” is doing. The idea is that if tons of cash surges into
mutual funds, investors are getting overly optimistic, and it might be a
good time to sell. You can see fund flows at www.ici.org/stats/
mf/index.html; as for how effective mutual funds are at pointing out
what not to do, check out Table 6-3. Basically, the market doesn’t always
work out the way the mutual fund investors want.

What Moves Stocks in the Long Term?
Almost anything can move stocks in the short term. Investors are so touchy
on a minute-by-minute basis that they might even sell stocks if a Wall Street
trader sneezes. Long term, though, the market is much more, well, sane.
Several key factors stocks’ returns over the long term: 
 Company fundamentals, such as how much the company generates in
cash and earnings over its lifetime, are the major contributor to how its
stock performs. I discuss how to analyze long-term financial perfor-
mance in Chapters 12 and 13.
 Long-term economic trends set the table for stocks. If there’s a chronic
problem with inflation or low economic growth, that will spell trouble
for many investments. 
166

 Valuations are how much you’re paying for a piece of a company. A
stock’s valuation is a measure of how expensive it is based on how much
the company is expected to earn in profit. This is pursued in more detail
in Chapter 12. 
 Risk is the price you pay for higher returns. If you own a piece of a risky
asset, you should demand a higher return in exchange. Academic
research discussed in Chapter 1 shows how shares of companies that
have been left for dead, called value stocks, have generated higher
returns over the long term because they’re riskier. Shares of small com-
panies and companies based in emerging markets also tend to generate
higher returns because they’re riskier. I describe the relationship
between a stock’s risk and return in Chapter 3.
167
Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
What doesn’t move stocks: Stock splits
My readers are always asking me to explain
stock splits to them. For some reason, individual
investors are fascinated by stock splits, perhaps
because they think they’re getting something for
nothing. 
A stock split occurs when a company believes
its stock price is getting high enough to scare
off investors with sticker shock. Companies
might consider a split if their shares get to $75
or higher. After a split, investors own more
shares, but the stock price is cut. For instance,
when a company does a 2-for-1 stock split,
investors get twice the number of shares, but
the stock price is cut in half. So if you had 100
shares of a $10 stock, worth $1,000, after the
split you’d have 200 shares worth $5. There’s no
change in the size of your stake; you still own
$1,000 in stock. 
Most financial Web sites show you if a stock
has split. MSN Money, for instance, places a
box on a historical stock chart to indicate when
a split occurred. StockSplits.net (www.stock
splits.net) also tracks splits and has a free
newsletter for people who are interested.
The value of stock splits is controversial. Some
academic research shows stock splits are early
signals a company will perform well in the
future. The theory is a company’s management
wouldn’t split the stock unless it was fairly cer-
tain the stock was headed higher. 
Other research, though, finds splits to have neg-
ligible value for investors. Zacks Investment
Research studied small- and midsize companies
going back to 1998 to see how splits of at least
1.5-to-1 affected the shares of companies up to
12 months later. Zacks found no discernable dif-
ference in the returns of companies that split
their stock versus those that didn’t over the fol-
lowing 12 months. 
Some suggest splits are out of style with
investors. Berkshire Hathaway class B shares,
trading for more than $3,578, and Google shares
that traded above $500 have both been per-
ceived as somehow being attractive precisely
because of their high share prices. 

Going back to school with 
academic research
If you’re curious about what moves stocks in the long-term, spend time read-
ing the research put out by academics. Because they’re not pressured to sell
investments, academics have the time to sit down, study markets, and search
for patterns. Some of the work that has come from academia has revolution-
ized investing and has greatly enhanced the understanding of why stocks do
what they do. I mention several critical sources of academic research in
Chapter 1. Other online resources worth checking out include the following: 
 Google Scholar: (http://scholar.google.com) This particular arm
of Google, shown in Figure 6-5, lets you search through millions of acade-
mic papers for those that match your search terms. You can follow the
links to get access to view the research.
 Live.com: (www.live.com) This site helps you quickly search academic
research and view the summaries from a single page. Enter your search
terms and click the Search button. When your Results page appears,
click the More link and choose Academic from the drop-down menu to

 Social Science Research Network: (http://papers.ssrn.com) Here
you can find the primary database for published works by academics.
The database is fully searchable by keyword and author. You can view
some of the research for free, but other parts you have to pay for.
 Jeremy Siegel: (www.jeremysiegel.com) Siegel is a professor at the
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, is best known for
exhaustive market research. Some of Siegel’s data has led to important
discoveries, including the concept that stocks become less risky the
longer they’re held. You can read many of Siegel’s work and research at
this site, but there’s a charge to access most of it. Siegel has also cofoun-
ded a company, WisdomTree (www.wisdomtree.com), which sells invest-
ment products that take advantage of his research. I discuss Siegel’s work
in greater detail in Chapter 11, where I explain exchange-traded funds.
Learning from the wise men
Some investors have so much experience with markets that they’re very worth-
while listening to. No, they’re not always right, but you can learn from their
mistakes. A few examples, in addition to those listed in Chapter 1, include
 Warren Buffett: (www.berkshirehathaway.com) He’s perhaps the best-
known and most successful investor ever, so it’s worth your while to listen
to him. Each year Buffett, CEO of a holding company called Berkshire
Hathaway, releases the company’s annual report in addition to various let-
ters to shareholders. Even if you’re not a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder,
Buffett’s letters are some of the best reads in finance. Not only are they
cleverly written and full of turns of phrase, but they contain market
insight you can’t find elsewhere. Berkshire Hathaway’s financial reports
are available for free on the company’s Web site, shown in Figure 6-6.

Not all academic reports are boring
I’m not going to mislead you; most academic
reports are hardly light reading. Many are
packed with scary-looking mathematical for-
mulas and exhaustive research. But don’t let
this frighten you from taking advantage of these
(often-times free) research reports. Most of the
time, the summary or abstract page at the front
of the report will be enough to give you the gist. 
And sometimes, academic reports can be sur-
prisingly fun. For instance, “Deal or No Deal?
Decision Making under Risk in a Large-Payoff
Game Show” analyzes the behavior of investors
by studying how people react in the popular TV
game shows, including Deal or No Deal. The
study finds that investors tend to get more
greedy and accept greater risk immediately
after a small victory. You can read the study,

I
f there’s one area of investing online that’s evolved most since the last edi-
tion of this book, it’s the ways in which investors can connect with each
other. Online investors used to rely on stock message boards, often called chat
boards, to trade stock tips, gossip, and hunches with each other. Stock mes-
sage boards are still a way for investors to connect, but they’re gradually
being supplanted by new types of networking sites, which have distinct
advantages. In the first part of this chapter, I show you how to get online 
with stock message boards, including how to contribute to them and what to
watch out for. Later, I explore the dangers of penny stocks, which are some of
the favorites on stock message boards and other online forums. And lastly, I
explore the emerging area of social investing sites. 
Finding Kindred Investment 
Spirits Online
Whenever you’re about to try something risky, or at least something you’ve
never done before, it’s comforting to talk to people with experience. That’s

why many investors attempt to connect with each other. You have several
ways to do this: through stock message boards, investment clubs, or social
investing sites. 
These are a few reasons why you might consider adding a social aspect to
your investment strategy:
 Moral support: Many beginning online investors are bewildered by the
things they need to remember. By connecting with other investors
online who have already done what you’re thinking about doing, you 
can gain first-hand knowledge of the risks and rewards.
 A new perspective: You might think you know the best way to manage
your money. But why not run your strategy by others and make sure
you’re not overlooking anything?
 New ideas for investments: Members of online communities come from
different professions and from all over the world. You can use this diver-
sity to your advantage and might even find out about investments you’d
never heard of. 
Getting the Message with 
Stock Message Boards
When you think of connecting with other investors, you probably instantly
think of stock message boards — and for good reason. These informal,
anonymous forums were an early way for investors to chat with each other
online. They give you an instant way to brag about your returns, promote a
stock you own, or flame a stock you’ve sold for a loss. 
Stock message boards aren’t for everyone
Some investors, especially passive investors described in Chapter 1, might
not care what other investors think about their stocks. They’ve formed their
asset allocation — as described in Chapter 9 — and they’re going to stick
with that no matter what. 
But if you’re an active investor and see online investing as a hobby, you
might be very interested in the chatter surrounding stocks you’re consider-
ing. Stock message boards are suited for you if you
172
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 View investing as a form of entertainment: Some investors buy and sell
stocks not so much to accumulate a nest egg, but for speculation. It’s
almost like a trip to Las Vegas. 
 Don’t want to hassle with signup procedures: You can be up and run-
ning with most stock message boards in just minutes and usually don’t
even have to identify yourself. 
 Know the rules: Investors who understand that many of the things 
said on stock message boards are exaggerations, manipulations, or just
plain wrong have a better chance finding any worthwhile nuggets of
information. 
Blindly following what other investors are doing, generally speaking, isn’t a
good strategy and can be dangerous. If you’re looking for stock message
boards for stock recommendations, you’ll likely be disappointed with your
results. 
Understanding the types 
of stock message boards
Although stock message boards have been around essentially since the start
of online investing, they’ve morphed quite a bit through the past bull and
bear markets. But currently, they’re available on a number of different plat-
forms. The following sections explore the various corners of the Internet
where investors congregate to swap info.
Using online stock message boards as the key to your investment strategy
isn’t a good idea. Listening to so many other opinions might cause you to
second-guess yourself and prompt you to buy and sell stocks too often. But
more importantly, you don’t know who you’re chatting with, and such boards
are havens for scammers. Consider Anthony Elgindy, an infamous stock
picker who developed a strong following for some of his picks on Silicon
Investor as “AnthonyPacific,” in addition to promoting stocks on his own Web
site. Elgindy was convicted in 2005 in federal court on multiple counts of
securities fraud and extortion. Remember, always consider the source when
using stock message boards to pick stocks. 
The investing areas of general Internet portals 
Each of the main general Internet search engines and portals contain mes-
sage boards. But they aren’t created equally, and some get much higher
levels of participation than others. The big players here are
173
Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online

 Yahoo! Finance: (http://finance.yahoo.com) Yahoo! Finance has
become a top destination for the casual stock message board partici-
pant. Just enter a stock symbol of a company you’d like to hear about
into the Enter Symbol(s) text field, click the Get Quotes button, then
click the Message Board link in the News & Info section of the new page
that appears. You can scroll down through the messages and read them,
but if you want to reply to messages, you’ll need a Yahoo! sign-on ID and
password.
 MSN Investor’s: (http://moneycentral.msn.com/community/
message/default.aspx) This section of the MSN Money site works a
little differently than Yahoo! Finance. You can start by checking out the
Message Board Summary page, which shows broad investing topics that
are being actively discussed. If you’re looking for a message board about
a particular stock, select the Topics and Tickers link under the Message
Board section on the left-hand side of the page. Scroll down and you’ll
see a list of the letters of the alphabet. Click on the letter the company
name starts with and you’ll see which stocks are being discussed. 
 Google Finance: (http://finance.google.com) Google Finance pro-
vides stock message boards if you enter the company’s symbol, click the
Search Finance button, and then click the Discuss Your Stock link on the
new page that appears, where Your Stock is the stock whose symbol you
just entered. 
Specialized stock message boards
These boards are often the most popular sites with individual investors who
see themselves as being more advanced than those using the general Internet
portals’ boards. Examples include
 Raging Bull: (http://ragingbull.quote.com) One of the favorite
spots for day traders and active speculators, you can find a board 
on just about anything, ranging from individual stocks to specific 
industries — you can even trade investing jokes!
 Silicon Investor: (www.siliconinvestor.com) This site tends to
attract investors primarily interested in large and mid-sized publicly
traded companies. 
 Investors Hub: (www.investorshub.com) Discussions here tend to
focus on who’s hot (and who’s not) among smaller companies. 
 ADVFN: (www.advfn.com) Advanced Financial Network (ADVFN) is the
parent company of both Silicon Investor and Investors Hub. ADVFN is a
popular source for European investors to discuss investments that are
important across the pond. 
174
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 ClearStation: (http://clearstation.etrade.com) This site
attempts to organize the random chaos of thousands of messages by let-
ting you sort them based on the reputation of the author. You can even
receive an alert when a certain ClearStation member you trust posts
information.
Stock message board aggregators
You can waste a great deal of time hopping between all the different stock
message boards. Some sites, called aggregators, try to solve this problem by
pulling in the messages into one place. They include
 BoardCentral: (www.boardcentral.com) Board Central offers a single
place to get messages from Yahoo! Finance, RagingBull, ClearStation,
Google, Silicon Investor, and others. It also ranks the stocks that are
being talked about the most as well as those stocks that investors are
most often searching for.
 InstantBull: (www.instantbull.com) This site also compiles mes-
sages from multiple stock message boards. InstantBull’s biggest advan-
tage is that you can quickly read the messages by just moving your
mouse over the subject line. You can see how the site is structured in
Figure 7-1.

Knowing the ulterior motives of some
online stock message board members
Although many of the people who use online stock message boards might be
upstanding individuals just looking to help their fellow man, great caution is
warranted. People can abuse online stock message boards for personal gain
in several ways, including the following:
 Hyping stocks they own: Some members might exaggerate or even
make up good news regarding a stock they own, hoping to fool others
into buying the stock. This is commonly called a pump-and-dump scheme
or ramping.
 Disparaging stocks they’re shorting: Investors can profit from a falling
stock by shorting shares, as described in Chapter 5. Some investors
might spread false rumors about a company with hopes that such
rumors will cause a panic and get others to sell. 
 Promoting companies that pay them: Questionable companies can hire
legions of stock promoters to stoke enthusiasm for their shares. These
promoters might float a stream of positive press releases online, trying
to create the appearance the company has lots going on. 
176
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
Stock message boards and the Enron debacle
Despite the many problems with stock message
boards, sometimes they can contain very valu-
able pieces of information. You should carefully
monitor the boards for comments that appear to
be from informed employees. The stock mes-
sage boards, in fact, were one of the only
places where investors were warned about the
coming collapse of Enron in 2001, one of the
largest bankruptcies in U.S. history.
Between 1997 and 2001, ahead of Enron’s fall,
there were more than 129 detailed posts on
Enron’s stock message board on Yahoo!,
according to James Felton and Jongchai Kim in
their article “Warnings from the Enron Message
Board.” These posts, many that appear to be
from employees, indicated serious problems 
at the company, even while most Wall Street
analysts rated the stock “buy” or “strong buy.”
In April 2001, for instance, an anonymous post
read, “It will soon be revealed that Enron is
nothing more than a house of cards that will
implode before anyone realizes what happened.
Enron has been cooking the books with smoke
and mirrors. Enron executives have been oper-
ating an elaborate scheme that has fooled even
the most sophisticated analyst.” 
That post appeared online four months before
Enron employee Sherron Watkins wrote 
the famous warning letter to Enron CEO Ken 
Lay. You can read the article at http://
papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?
abstract_id=918519#PaperDownload.

Determining what exchange 
or market a stock trades on
If you’re going to be using stock message boards, you need to know the differ-
ence between unlisted stocks and stocks listed on an exchange. Some of the
most popular stocks discussed on stock message boards aren’t listed on an
exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Instead, they trade on informal and
lightly regulated electronic markets such as the Pink Sheets or OTC Bulletin
Board. 
It’s important for you to know whether a stock trades on the Pink Sheets or
OTC Bulletin Board, because if it’s trading there, it doesn’t have to meet the
same listing standards that any stock on the exchanges needs to meet. That
means the stocks have less oversight. For instance, stocks on the Pink Sheets
aren’t required to file audited financial statements. And many stocks on these
exchanges are abandoned shell companies that can be used by fraudsters to
create a pump-and-dump scheme. (These dangers are covered in greater
detail in the “A penny saved: Beware of penny stocks” section, later in this
chapter.) But for now, you want to know how to find out where your stock
trades. The following step list shows you how to find out the primary market
for a specific stock : 
1. Point your browser to NASDAQ.com (www.nasdaq.com)
2. Click the Symbol Lookup button.
The Symbol Lookup screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
You can find the Symbol Lookup button toward the middle of the screen,
just below the Get Up To 10 Quotes section — the one for entering ticker
symbols as part of a stock quote search. Since we’re looking for a stock’s
exchange, leave the radio button on its default Stocks setting.

3. Enter either the company’s name or ticker symbol
If you know the company’s name, enter it into the first blank, next to
where it says Name. If you only know the symbol, enter that into the
second blank, next to where is says Symbol.
4. Click the Go button at the bottom of the screen.
A new page appears, listing the results of your search
5. View the company name and look at the market.
The entry under the Market heading — the heading at the far right of the

A penny saved: Beware of penny stocks
If you spend much time looking at online stock message boards, you might
notice that many of the messages are posted about stocks that trade for less
than $1 — so-called “penny” stocks. That’s partly because penny stocks, due
to their tiny share prices, allow investors to buy large numbers of shares.
Owning large chunks of stock is appealing to the same speculator-types that
flock to stock message boards to begin with. 
But penny stocks can also be popular on stock message boards because
they’re easily manipulated. Unlike giant stocks like General Electric or Cisco,
which are so valuable that you’d need billions of dollars to budge the stock,
penny stocks can be nudged with just a few hundred bucks. Just a small
amount of hype or negativity can have a large effect on a penny stock’s share
price. A stock has to move only from one penny to two pennies to double a
fraudster’s money.
Many penny stocks also trade on the generally unregulated Pink Sheets and
OTC Bulletin Board markets, considered to be the Wild Wild West of online

investing. It’s best to avoid investing in penny stocks, but if you can’t resist
be sure you have
 Read the warnings from regulators: The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) has released multiple warnings to investors about
investing in penny stocks, including this must-read guide: http://sec.
gov/investor/pubs/microcapstock.htm. You should also search
for the company’s name and officers using the tools at the SEC’s main
site (www.sec.gov) to see whether there have been prior problems.
The SEC outlines the unique risks of investing in Pink Sheet stocks at
http://sec.gov/answers/pink.htm.
 Checked the company’s level of disclosure: Pink Sheets (www.pink
sheets.com) rates companies with one of four icons, shown in Figure 7-3,
indicating how much information they provide to investors. The highest-
quality rating is Current Information, followed by Limited Information,
No Information, and then Caveat Emptor. Just enter the stock’s symbol,
and you can view the rating. 
The OTC Bulletin Board (www.otcbb.com) offers similar information on
its stocks. The site, for instance, has a Delinquency/Eligibility list show-
ing companies that haven’t met its standards. (www.otcbb.com/
DailyListContent/delistings/OTCBBDelOpenReport.pdf). 
And you can find additional cautionary information at www.otcbb.com/

Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online

 Done your due-diligence: You should, at the very least, see whether the
company has released any financial statements. (Chapter 2 has more on
how to check for financial statements.) And if financial information is
available, you should carefully analyze it using the guide in Chapter 12.
StockPatrol (www.stockpatrol.com) also features in-depth investiga-
tive reports of companies, including many penny stocks. StockPatrol’s
search feature will show you whether a stock you’re interested in has
been written about. Just reading the stories, meanwhile, will give you an
idea on how to investigate penny stock companies.
 Double-checked that you can’t do better: With thousands of stocks
listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, you should be able to find a listed
stock you’d like to invest in. 
Tapping into Online Newsgroups
Newsgroups are similar to stock message boards in that they’re giant online
bulletin boards where members can post largely anonymous comments. But
unlike stock message boards, which run on Web sites, most newsgroups live
on a pretty ancient network, called Usenet. Usenet is a corridor of the
Internet that’s roped off for discussion groups.

Don’t be fooled: Starbucks wasn’t a penny stock
Some penny-stock investors claim many suc-
cessful stocks like Starbucks and Microsoft
started out as penny stocks. They look at long-
term charts online, as described in Chapter 6,
and say those stocks started trading at less than
$2 a share. That is simply not true, and it’s
worthwhile to understand why.
Consider Starbucks. Some investors look at a
long-term chart and claim the coffeehouse
chain’s shares closed on their first day of trad-
ing on June 26, 1992 at $0.672 apiece. And if you
look at a chart, that appears to be true. But it’s
an illusion caused by stock splits. When a stock
splits, as described in Chapter 6, the company
cuts its share price and increases the number
of shares. A stock split has no effect on the
value of the stock or company, but changes his-
torical prices because most charting services
split-adjust historical stock prices. Starbucks’
shares have had five 2-for-1 splits since they
debuted on NASDAQ.
To find out what the actual closing price of
Starbucks’ stock was on June 26, 1992, you
must undo the effect of the five splits that
occurred after that date. You do that by multi-
plying the split-adjusted stock price in 1992, or
$0.672, by each split amount. For Starbucks,
that’s 0.672 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = $21.50. That
means Starbucks’ actual price at the end of its
first day of trading was $21.50, not 67 cents. 

Usenet hosts newsgroups pertaining to just about any topic you can imagine,
and some you can’t. You can find forums where members talk about groom-
ing their pets, tuning their cars, and, oh yeah, investing online. 
How to locate specific online newsgroups 
Because there are thousands of forums on Usenet, they’re all carefully cate-
gorized by topic. Usenet uses a very precise naming convention so you can
zero in on a topic quickly and find the appropriate forums. Usenet forums are
given a three-part address, much like a street address. First, there’s the broad
category, or section, which is equivalent to the state on your home address.
Beneath these main sections are the secondary sections. Using my address
metaphor, the secondary section is like your city. Lastly, the groups are
broken into very specific topic areas, much like your street address.
A typical newsgroup address would look like this: section.second 
section.topic. For instance, a newsgroup dedicated to mutual funds is
misc.invest.mutual-funds, where misc is the section, invest is the
secondary section, and mutual-funds is the topic. 
In case you haven’t noticed yet, the whole newsgroup address naming con-
vention is bit of a hassle. That’s why you’ll probably access newsgroups
using Google Groups, as described in the following section. Google Groups
handles the whole Usenet address nightmare for you. 
Some sample investing newsgroups you might consider include the ones in
Table 7-2.

How to participate in online newsgroups 
So, you understand how Usenet addresses work and the kinds of topics that
are available. But how do you access these newsgroups? Because news-
groups are essentially in the public domain, you can access them in many
ways, including the following:
 Google Groups: (http://groups.google.com) Probably the best
way to access Usenet newsgroups, Google Groups (see Figure 7-4) lets
you search all available newsgroups by entering the group name or topic
in the search field — all without installing any special reader software
often required by browsers. Try terms like “investing,” “investing online,”
and “money.” There’s no need to remember or look up the complicated
Usenet addresses. Google Groups also organizes newsgroups by topic
area. Just sign up for the service or log in using your Google Gmail
account information — although some newsgroups may require 
additional registration. 
If you know the Usenet newsgroup address, such as misc.invest.
stocks, Google Groups can still help. Just enter the Usenet address in
the search field and you can access the newsgroup.

 Yahoo! Groups: (http://finance.dir.groups.yahoo.com/dir/
Business___Finance/Investments) Yahoo! Groups doesn’t actually
connect to Usenet; rather, it links you with groups created within Yahoo!.
In this particular corner of Yahoo! Groups, you can find newsgroups that
discuss everything from mutual funds to day trading.
Although newsgroups can be okay sources of investment chatter, social
investing sites are typically better bets because they make their users more
accountable. (I discuss social investing sites later in the chapter.) Generally, 
I find that newsgroups are best suited for getting technical help when you’re
having computer problems — when you’re having questions about personal
finance software, for example. Just post a question to a group listed in Table 7-3,
and the experts will help you out. You might also use newsgroups to hear
what people are saying about a company’s products to give you the 
inside track.

Connecting with an Investment Club
If online stock message boards seem too wild and scary but you’d still like 
to connect with other investors, you might consider an investment club.
Investment clubs are typically gatherings of investors in a certain geographic
area who meet at a local restaurant or a member’s house to shoot the breeze.
Members pitch stocks they think the group should buy or sell. Investment
clubs also have a bit of a party feeling to them, because they’re usually
designed to be fun, educational, and, oh yeah, profitable. If your city doesn’t
have an investment club, or if meeting with people in person doesn’t fit your
schedule, there are a few online investment clubs cropping up. Whether the
club you’re interested in joining is held in the local Moose club or online, you
may be required to buy in by adding money to a pool of cash. 
183
Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online

How to find an investment 
club that suits you
If you’re interested in an investment club, here are several (online) ways to
get started:
 National Association of Investors Corporation, also known as Better-
Investing (www.betterinvesting.org) is one of the top associations
of investment clubs. BetterInvesting’s Web site lets you find investment
clubs in your area. There are also online classes you can take to work on
improving your investing success. And if there’s no investment club near
you, you can find out how to start a club of your own or join an online
investment club.
 The Motley Fool (http://boards.fool.com/Boards.asp?fid=
10002) maintains a discussion board where investors in different states
can find investment clubs. Just enter the discussion group for your state
and say you’re interested in joining. 
 Bivio (www.bivio.com) is perfect if you’d like the friendly and personal
nature of an investment club but don’t have time to attend monthly
meetings. Bivio is a collection of online investment clubs. You can search
through the club home pages and choose a club to join or even start
your own.
 Value Investors Club (http://valueinvestorsclub.com) is a selec-
tive group of just 250 members who pick stocks. You must apply to be
accepted, and if you get chosen, you must submit two stock picks a year.
Understanding the drawbacks 
of investment clubs
Before you rush out and join an investment club, be aware of the potential
drawbacks: 
 Bad decisions by others will cost you. If the loudmouthed guy in the
club talks the group into buying a stinker, you’re going to take a bath, too.
 They give an incentive to tinker. Many investment clubs consider them-
selves to be long-term investors, or shareholders who hang onto a stock for
at least a year and usually much longer. But an investment club wouldn’t
be much fun if the members never actually bought or sold anything. That
means there’s somewhat of an incentive to be constantly buying or selling
investments.
184
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Compromise can hurt. Although nothing is wrong with agreement,
having several people steering a portfolio sometimes means there’s no
single and coherent strategy. 
 Members’ investing skill levels can vary. Some investment club mem-
bers are only there for the fun, food, and friends. That can leave much of
the grunt work for the few members with the skill or desire to make
money in the club.
The Brave New World: Social Networking
Meets Online Investing
As the Internet grows up, it’s becoming more clear the Internet is all about
connecting people who might never have crossed paths in real life. Myspace.
com has become the digital version of a high-school lunchroom and is the
place for people to talk about what’s in and what’s not. YouTube lets anyone
with a video camera film just about anything and share it with the world. And
the online video game Second Life has morphed into a fully developed world
where real estate has actual value and companies spend real money market-
ing to the online community. 
Online social networking is now trickling into the investment world, and early
signs seem promising. Social investing sites answer some of the shortcom-
ings of stock message boards and investment clubs. 
Social investing sites as a higher 
form of stock message boards?
Social networking stands to be a major advance in how investors interface
with each other. Unlike stock message boards, which cloak their users in
anonymity, social networking is based on posting actual trades and often
even investors’ real names. And unlike simulations, discussed in Chapter 2,
social investing sites are based on real trades with investors’ real money. The
main advantages of this exciting new area of investing online are
 Showing what’s possible in the real world: Anyone can get lucky pick-
ing winning stocks with funny money. Social investing sites take away
the fantasy aspect of simulations by encouraging users to disclose
actual stocks they own and when they bought and sold them. You can
use that information to determine who’s credible versus investors who
talk a big game and those who might have ulterior motives. 
185
Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online

 Separating the good from the bad: Social investing sites often let you
know how often different members are right about their picks. 
 Providing some safeguards: Brokers operating social investing sites are
overseen by securities regulators. Fraudsters know this and might avoid
certain social investing sites because they could be easily tracked and
monitored. It’s similar to how a bank robber might not target a bank
that’s across the street from the police station.
Plugging into social investing sites
I discuss several popular social investing sites below, but they all, at their
core, work roughly the same. Follow these six steps to get involved in social
investing: 
1. Pick a site. 
Social investing sites are essentially gated communities of investors. You
want to choose the site that fits you best and has a pool of investors you
can identify with. I’ll help you choose in the later section, “Choosing a
social investing site.”
2. Register.
Most social investing sites require you to give more details about your-
self than some stock message boards do. That might be a slight burden
at first, but it’s also one of the ways these sites eliminate users that
insist on being cloaked in privacy.
3. Create a profile.
Here you describe yourself, only giving details you’re comfortable shar-
ing with the rest of the social investing site. Typically, you might say
how long you’ve been investing, what kind of investor you are, and what
types of stocks you prefer.
4. Enter your transactions.
The biggest thing that separates social investing sites from stock mes-
sage boards is that other users can see your real trades if you give per-
mission. That means you’ll need to import your trades or give the site
permission to share them. Trades may be imported several ways, either
manually by you or automatically when you enter an order to buy or sell
shares with your online broker. 
5. Set your permissions.
Permissions are rules telling the social investing site how much personal
information you’re comfortable with sharing. You can choose to use a
fake name, or handle, or reveal your real name. You can decide whether
186
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

you’ll let other users look at your trades or send messages to you. This
is an important step. The more information you reveal about yourself,
the more credibility you’ll have on the site with other users. 
Be careful about listening to stock tips and recommendations by social
investing users who reveal very little personal information about them-
selves. These users might be cloaking themselves for the same reasons
some investors are attracted to the anonymous world of stock message
boards.
6. Look around. 
After you’re set up with a profile, you can peruse the community to find
people you might want to be “friends” with. These are investors you
think are worthwhile listening to. You can also read other investors’
blogs (Web logs), which are their personal narratives on how to invest. 
Starting to get social: Trying 
social investing sites
Two types of social investing sites exist: standalone sites and broker-
operated sites. You need to decide which is better for you. The standalone
sites might appeal to you if you want to 
 Keep your social investing and brokerage accounts apart from each
other. 
 Try out social investing with test trades before linking your real account.
 Maintain your online accounts with traditional or discount online 
brokerages that don’t offer social investing. 
 Use multiple online brokerage accounts and be able pull in all your 
holdings and trades to one social investing site. 
You might think about signing up with your online broker’s social investing
service if you want to
 Have your trades automatically shared with other users, after granting
your permission. 
 Don’t want to bother getting another username and password and trying
to remember them.
 Feel that the other members of the brokerage firm have similar investing
goals and styles as you.
187
Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online

Choosing a social investing site
After you’ve chosen whether you want to join a standalone or broker-
sponsored social investing site, it’s time to pick one. This is an emerging area,
and new players will certainly be showing up, so be sure to search for new
social investing sites that have started since this book was published.
Most online brokers don’t offer social investing capabilities, yet. If your
broker hasn’t jumped on the social investing bandwagon yet, and you want to
try it out, you might consider some of the dedicated social investing sites.
Here’s a few to try:
 Covestor: (www.covestor.com) A standalone social investing site that
lets regular online investors emerge as experts, Covestor, with your per-
mission, pulls in your real trades from more than 100 online and tradi-
tional brokerage firms. Other investors can see what kinds of stocks
you’re buying and see how well they’re performing. All the investors are
ranked so visitors can choose who’s worth listening to. 
 Collective2: (www.collective2.com) This site is like most other
social investing sites in that it tracks and shares your real trades. But
unlike Covestor, which downloads your trades from your online brokers,
Collective2 works in reverse. You enter your real trades in Collective2,
which then sends your orders to actual brokers. The system directly
connects with a handful of brokers. Alternatively, you can download
TradeBullet software (www.tradebullet.com), which routes your
orders from Collective2 to additional brokerages. 
Two online brokerage firms, TradeKing and Zecco, have been the innovators
in the area of social networking. Both offerings are very pioneering and it will
be interesting to see if other online brokerage follow suit and add social net-
working to their sites, too. Here are the details:
 TradeKing: (www.tradeking.com) TradeKing is an online brokerage
that offers social investing. The online brokerage, discussed more fully
in Chapter 4, lets its investors interact with each other. You can decide
how much information, if any, you choose to share with other members.
Often times, you might just begin with a profile page and, after you get
more comfortable, begin sharing more — including your trades.
TradeKing makes it easy to find the honest investors by giving them
Certified status. These are investors that are most forthright and open
with their real-life investing activity. 
You don’t have to have a brokerage account to take advantage of the
community site. But if you don’t, remember that other TradeKing users
probably won’t take you all that seriously because they can’t see your
real-life trades. You can read more about how TradeKing ranks as an
online broker in Chapter 4.
188
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Zecco Share: (www.zecco.com) Zecco Share, as with TradeKing, is
interesting because it lets investors share their real-life trades. Zecco
Share makes it easy to find others with similar goals by allowing you to
search for investors with the same approach, experience, or research
style. After you find other investors you trust, you can communicate
with them, watch their trades, and even receive an e-mail if they buy or
sell anything. 
Finding Information for 
Investors Like You
Online investors typically fall in one of two categories: active or passive. But
investors can classify themselves in many other ways, be it by age, experi-
ence level, or gender. Plenty of Web sites are dedicated to serving specific
demographics if that’s what you’re looking for.
Sites for kids
There’s nothing better than encouraging young people to start investing.
Several sites are dedicated to young investors:
 Young Investor (www.younginvestor.com) is filled with fun quizzes
and games to help your kids understand the value of money and 
investing.
 Investing for Kids (http://library.thinkquest.org/3096) offers
different stock games for kids and educational materials.
 Kids’ Money (www.kidsmoney.org) provides all sorts of money man-
agement tips for children.
 Young Investors Network (www.smithbarney.com/yin) is a site
offered from Smith Barney to make investing approachable and fun.
 Moneyopolis (www.moneyopolis.com) brings a video-game like
approach to teaching kids about money.
 Planet Orange (www.orangekids.com) lets kids climb mountains and
avoid alligators in the quest to learn more about managing their money.
189
Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online

Some parents have told me they get their kids interested in investing by split-
ting their allowance in two parts. One part is paid in cash and the other is
automatically deposited into a savings account that the child chooses. It’s a
good way to show children how money saved can snowball.
Sites for women
To be honest, there really isn’t that much of a difference between how a man
or woman would invest. But some sites are tailored to females and provide
various money-management suggestions:
 Wi$eUp (http://wiseupwomen.tamu.edu) contains calculators and
tutorials for young women.
 Women’s Institute for Financial Education (www.wife.org) describes
and answers many money questions that women have.
 iVillage (http://home.ivillage.com/homeoffice/saveinvest/
topics/0,,4tn5,00.html) contains quizzes and information for
women hoping to take control of their money.
Sites for seniors
The financial goals and objectives of senior citizens are completely different
than those of a 20-something just entering the workforce. These sites address
the unique situation of older investors:
 AARP: (www.aarp.org/research/financial) The American
Association of Retired People (AARP) lists information critical to older
investors, helping with investing and retirement planning.
 MSN Money: (http://moneycentral.msn.com/retire/home.asp)
This section of the MSN Money site contains information older investors
need to make sure their nest eggs last.
 ElderNet: (www.eldernet.com/money.htm) This section of the
ElderNet site pinpoints links to tutorials, calculators, and other online
tools to help individuals become financially independent.
Seniors are constant targets for unscrupulous money managers, so they need
to be extra cautious. A group of retirees, many living in the Leisure World
retirement community in Orange County, California, learned this the hard
way and lost their life savings as a result. The retirees invested $12 million
with Christopher Peter Cook and his CD Services, Inc., between 1995 and
190
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

1998. Cook promised the retirees interest rates higher than banks were offer-
ing, but he said money could be withdrawn anytime. It turns out, though, that
Cook and associates were funneling the money into inappropriate invest-
ments and took 52% of investors’ money as “commissions,” according to the
Department of Justice (http://losangeles.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/
pressrel07/la062507usa.htm). If investors asked for their money, they
were told there was a 50% early withdrawal fee. The Cooks ended up taking
$4.8 million from the investors. Cook was convicted of mail fraud and money
laundering and sentenced to nearly eight years in prison. 
Before you give your money to anyone to manage, you should run the person’s
name through FINRA’s Broker Check system (www.finra.org/Investor
Information/InvestorProtection/ChecktheBackgroundofYour
InvestmentProfessional/index.htm). Make sure the person has 
the proper licenses to give financial advice and hasn’t been disciplined in 
the past.

 Choosing the right benchmark
I
t’s surprising how many investors keep buying and selling stocks online
even when they have no idea whether they’re beating the market or not.
They’ll brag at cocktail parties about the winning stocks they’ve bought. But
if you ask them what their rate of return is, they’ll look at you blankly. Most
online brokers don’t help either, because many don’t have tools that accu-
rately measure your returns. 
To me, investing online without knowing how you’re doing is like driving 
with your eyes closed. As an online investor, it’s pretty much up to you to 
calculate your own returns. To help you get back in control, this chapter first
shows you how to manually calculate your returns and how much risk you’ve
taken to get those returns. In case you want more handholding, I then discuss
online sites and software that do all the calculations for you. Either way you
choose, you’ll be miles ahead of other investors who keep investing without
knowing whether they’re successful or not.
The Importance of Tracking 
Your Performance
You learn from an early age to monitor your progress with most things. As
babies, your height and weight were plotted on charts to illustrate how
quickly you were growing and how your size ranked with other infants. In
school, your progress was constantly monitored using letter grades and

tests. And at work, annual reviews and pay often reflect the job you’re doing
and show what’s working and what’s not. 
That’s why it’s so strange that many people don’t monitor their investment
performance. Investors often look through their portfolios, see a few stocks
that are up since they bought them, and assume they’re beating the stock
market. 
Psychology plays a big part in investing. Many online investors tend to get
overly confident if they’ve recently picked a few lucky stocks. That prompts
them to take more uncalculated risks in the future, which might cost them
dearly. Investors also tend to wipe out painful losses from their memories.
They remember only the winners. And other investors beat themselves up
for losing money on a stock, blaming something that had nothing to do with
the loss. By measuring your performance, you can try to remove some of the
emotion from investing. (Morningstar, the independent investment research
outfit, has a great little lesson on how human nature can affect your success
investing online; check out http://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/
printlesson.asp?docId=145104&CN=com.)
I suspect most folks don’t bother monitoring their investment performance
because it requires some math and a few scary-looking formulas that most
investors don’t understand. This chapter, though, demystifies how to track
your portfolio’s risk and return. I start by showing you how to do the calcula-
tions yourself. 
It’s important for you to understand how all the calculations are done so 
you don’t blindly rely on Web sites to do it for you, but I also know that not
everyone has the time or the willingness to crunch down performance stats
themselves. And that’s why I’ve included online tools that do the math for
you. If you get confused at any point in this section about calculating perfor-
mance manually, don’t dismay. Just skip ahead to the section “Using Online
Tools to Calculate Performance for You.” 
Why it’s worth the trouble 
measuring your returns
Studies have shown that people who regularly weigh themselves tend to have
more success reaching their fitness goals. It’s similar with investing online. 
If you take the time to measure your results, you’ll likely be a better investor.
After all, even if your investments aren’t doing well, if you track your perfor-
mance, you might be able to adjust your strategy. Some investors, for instance,
might find that constantly buying and selling stocks isn’t working for them.
194
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

These investors can adjust accordingly and might find more success being
passive investors. (You can review the difference between active and passive
investors in Chapter 1.)
If you take the time to measure your performance, you’ll be able to figure out
whether you’re going to do the following 
 Reach your financial goals. When you invest, you typically estimate the
rate of return you need to reach your goal, such as funding retirement or
paying for college. By tracking your returns, you can see whether you’re
on the right path or not. And if you’re not, you can consider ways to
improve your results, including changing your asset allocation. I discuss
how to design the right asset allocation for you in Chapter 9.
One of the first things you should do before you start investing is decide
how much risk you can tolerate and what rate of return you need to
meet your goal. You can find out how to do this in Chapter 1.
 Hurt yourself more than help. If you’re an active investor who’s con-
stantly buying and selling stocks, you might be wasting your time and
hurting your portfolio. If you find that your returns are lower than what
you could get by just buying an index mutual fund, you might be better
served following a more passive approach. 
 Find your mistakes. You might have a good investment plan that’s work-
ing, except for a few investments or stocks that are killing your perfor-
mance. By tracking your results, you can find what’s hurting you and
make adjustments if needed. 
Curious what the top mistakes investors make might be? Check out
www.cfainstitute.org/aboutus/investors/articles/
12investormistakes.html, where the CFA Institute has posted a 
Not to Do list compiled by prominent professional money managers.
You’ll also find my own take on the top 10 mistakes made by investors 
in Chapter 17.
Why you want to measure your risk, too
I can’t tell you how many investors ask me for “ten stocks to buy now.”
Investors get so obsessed with the potential return for winning stocks that
they forget the other side of the picture: the risk. After all, you can get a great
return by putting all your chips on black at the roulette table. But are you
willing to risk it all? By measuring how much risk you’re taking on with your
investment, you’ll know whether you are
195
Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance

 Getting adequate returns: When you invest in a savings account, you’re
not taking any risk, so you shouldn’t expect a giant return. But if you
invest in a risky stock, you should demand to be compensated with a
bigger return. If you’re not, you’re being shortchanged.
 Invested properly: Some investors aren’t matched up with their invest-
ments very well. If you’re risk-adverse and can’t stomach it when your
portfolio falls just 5% in value in a year, you shouldn’t be invested in
risky stocks that go up and down wildly. You might consider changing
what types of investment you own so you can smooth the bumps. This is
done by creating your asset allocation. (You find out how to use online
tools to create a portfolio that fits your personality in Chapter 9.)
 Prepared for volatility: If you know how risky your investments are
ahead of time, you won’t be surprised when the value of your account
swings up and down. That foresight will help stop you from doing some-
thing in haste you’ll regret, such as selling all your stocks in panic. 
To get higher returns, you must accept more risk. Return and risk are tied at
the hip. However, investing in a risky asset doesn’t always mean you’ll get a
higher return. As you find out in Chapter 9, there are many risky assets that
have generated poor returns over the years. You’ll want to avoid these 
investments because they’re bum deals.
Calculating Your Performance Yourself 
If Web sites and software programs can calculate your portfolio’s risk and
return for you, why bother learning to do it yourself? I’ve found that many 
of the automated ways of calculating performance use slightly different meth-
ods, so you’re not always clear what’s going on. And with something this
important, you don’t want to rely solely on a Web site that might or might not
be accurate. If you know how performance is measured and can approximate
your performance yourself, you’ll know if you’re getting the right information
from the automated tools. 
If you don’t care to know how portfolio returns are measured and just want 
to do it online, go to MoneyChimp’s Portfolio Performance Calculator (www.
moneychimp.com/features/portfolio_performance_calculator.
htm). It automatically calculates your portfolio’s return if you enter your
portfolio’s beginning and ending balance and indicate whether you deposited
or withdrew money.
196
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

The easiest way to calculate returns
If you haven’t deposited money into or taken any money out of your broker-
age account, it’s relatively easy to measure your rate of return for the year.
Just follow these steps:
1. Get your account balance at the end of the year and write it down.
You can get your year-end balance from your online broker’s Web site or
from a printed statement.
2. Get your account balance at the end of the previous year and write it
down.
Again, this information is available from your broker’s Web site or from a
printed statement. 
3. Subtract the answer from Step 2 from the answer in step 1. Divide that
difference by the answer from step 2 and then multiply by 100.
Say your portfolio was worth $10,000 on December 31, 2006, and it was
worth $12,000 on December 31, 2007. You would subtract $10,000 from
$12,000 and get $2,000. Divide $2,000 by $10,000, multiply by 100, and
the answer is 20%. You earned a 20% rate of return in that year.
Don’t worry about dividends and splits when using this approach. And don’t
concern yourself if you’ve bought or sold stocks. As long as your dividends
and sale proceeds go into the brokerage account, this way of calculating your
return reflects all these things.
An easy way to calculate returns if you’ve
deposited or taken out money
You’re probably already asking the logical question: What if you deposited
money into or withdrew money from your brokerage account? It complicates
things a bit, but it’s still not hard. There’s an easy way to calculate your
return when there are deposits to or withdrawals from your account. 
Say your portfolio was worth $10,000 on December 31, 2006, and it was worth
$12,000 on December 31, 2007. But you made the following withdrawals and
deposits to you account, as shown in Table 8-1.

Okay, time to start crunching some numbers:
1. Get your account balance at the end of the previous year.
Using my example, you’d write down $10,000, which was your balance
on December 31, 2006.
2. Get your account balance at the end of the current year.
You’d write down $12,000, which was your supposed balance at the end
of 2007.
3. Add all the money you’ve added to your account during the year.
In my example, you’d write down $2,000 ($1,000 from March 20 plus
$1,000 from October 1).
Only include fresh money you’ve deposited into your account. Don’t
include dividends that were paid.
4. Add up all the money you’ve withdrawn from your account during the
year.
In my example, you’d write down $500. That’s the only withdrawal you
supposedly made.
Include just withdrawals from the account or checks you have written
on the account. Do not include stocks you’ve sold if you left the pro-
ceeds in your account. 
5. Subtract the answer from Step 4 from the answer from Step 3. Divide
the result by 2 and write down the answer.
In my example, you’d write down $750. You’d get that by subtracting the
$500 in supposed withdrawals from the $2,000 in supposed deposits.
Divide the answer, $1,500, by 2. 
6. Add the answer from Step 5 to the number from Step 1.
You’d write down $10,750. You’d get that by adding $750 to the number
from Step 1. 
198

7. Subtract the answer from Step 5 to the number from Step 2.
You’d write down $11,250. That’s $12,000 minus $750. 
8. Subtract the answer from step 6 from the answer in step 7. 
You’d write down $500. That’s $11,250 minus $10,750. 
9. Divide the answer from Step 8 by the answer in Step 7 and multiply
by 100.
You’d get your 4.7% rate of return by dividing $500 by $10,750 and multi-
plying by 100.
You might want to calculate how your portfolio is doing before the end of the
year. For instance, in June, you might want to get your mid-year performance.
That’s no problem. Just use the value of your portfolio at any date in the year
in Step 2. All the formulas remain the same.
The hardest way to calculate returns
The methods of calculating your returns described in the preceding sections
can get you accurate measures of your rate of return. But, as you can imag-
ine, there’s always a way to measure returns even more precisely. Some
mutual funds, for instance, use a complicated calculation called the dollar-
weighted return or internal rate of return. This requires advanced computing
that’s beyond the scope of this book. I show you some Web sites in this chap-
ter, though, that have computerized performance tracking tools that can mea-
sure your internal rate of return for you. 
You can find out more about different methods of calculating portfolio
returns at the following sites:
 Investment Performance Analysis (www.andreassteiner.net/
performanceanalysis/index.php) provides numerous free spread-
sheets and tools that can help you precisely measure how your portfolio
is doing. Be forewarned, though, these tools are very advanced.
 dailyVest (www.dailyvest.com) provides performance calculation ser-
vices for large investment companies. But dailyVest’s Web site contains
an in-depth description of the different ways returns are measured. 
 USATODAY.com’s Ask Matt (www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/
columnist/krantz/2006-06-27-tota-return_x.htm) explains in
all the gory details how to calculate your returns using either the easy
way or the hard way. Why would you trust someone who calls himself
Ask Matt? I can vouch for this character because it’s moi. Ask Matt is a

running feature at USATODAY.com, and this particular column deals with
the issue of measuring performance. 
 Microsoft Excel’s help page (http://office.microsoft.com/
en-us/excel/HP052093411033.aspx) provides instructions on how
to use the spreadsheet software to perform sophisticated performance
tracking. 
 Gummy Stuff (www.gummy-stuff.org/Dietz.htm) provides a 
free spreadsheet that can measure your returns by using advanced 
techniques.
Calculating How Risky Your Portfolio Is
The returns you get from investing online are only half of what you need to
know. Just as important, if not more so, is how much risk you took on to get
those returns. Measuring risk is a little more controversial. There are many
ways to do it, and investors generally disagree on the best way. 
Most investment professionals, though, acknowledge the value of measuring
risk by studying its standard deviation. Yikes, that’s a scary term and one that
might conjure up memories of statistics class. But by using readily available
online tools, you can use standard deviation as a way to get a handle on how
much risk you’re accepting in investing. Standard deviation is a mathematical
way to determine how much your portfolio swings in value from its average
return. 
Just know this: When your portfolio’s standard deviation is a large number,
there’s a good chance you’ll see some big ups and downs in your portfolio’s
value. And when the standard deviation is low, you have a good idea your
portfolio will pretty much give you your average return every year. 
Statistics tell us that 68% of the time, your portfolio should not rise by more
than its average return (plus the standard deviation) or fall more than its
average return (minus the standard deviation). And 95% of the time, your
portfolio shouldn’t rise by more than its average return plus two times its
standard deviation or fall by more than its average return minus two times its
standard deviation. 
For example, if you put your money in a five-year certificate of deposit that
pays 5% interest, the standard deviation of your return would be 0. In other
words, you will get 5% a year no matter what. But if you invest in a risky
stock that returns 15% a year on average, your standard deviation might be
closer to 40. That means 68% of the time you can expect your portfolio to 
200
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

be up 55% (the 15% average return plus the standard deviation) or down 25%
(the 15% average return minus the standard deviation). 
A simple way of calculating 
your average return
Before you can measure how risky your portfolio is, you must first calculate
its average yearly return. Earlier in the chapter you found out how to calcu-
late your portfolio’s annual returns. Next, you need to use those annual
returns to measure your portfolio’s average annual return. You can do this
easily by taking all your annual returns, calculated using the directions in the
earlier sections, and analyzing them. 
After you calculate your portfolio’s annual returns for each year, you’ll want
to write them down or put them in a spreadsheet. I’ll use the returns listed in
Table 8-2 as an example.

If the returns above look familiar, they should. Those are the annual returns
of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which tracks large company stocks, over
the past five years.
How do you measure your average return? You can’t just take a simple 
average by adding up all the returns and dividing by five. Doing that will 
give you the wrong answer. Instead, you must calculate the geometric mean.
The geometric mean is the way to correctly measure stock return, trust me. 
I could explain the technical difference between simple averages and geomet-
ric means, but we’ll both get headaches for no good reason. If you’re truly 
curious, Deborah Rumsey does a nice job explaining it in her Statistics 
For Dummies (Wiley). 
201
Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance

If you don’t want to go to the trouble to measure geometric mean as
described shortly, the Average Return Calculator at Hugh’s Mortgage and
Financial Calculators (www.hughchou.org/calc/areturn.php) can do 
it for you. Just enter your returns for each year, and the site calculates the
geometric mean or what it calls the “true average return.” Easy Calculation
(www.easycalculation.com/statistics/geometric-mean.php) can
also calculate the geometric mean.
You can calculate geometric means using a financial calculator or a spread-
sheet. But this is Investing Online For Dummies, right? So, I show you how to
do it online by using the Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator you see in
Figure 8-1 (available at www.graftacs.com/geomean.php3). 
Before you rush and type in the returns from Table 8-2 into Horton’s Geo-
metric Mean Calculator, you need to follow an additional step. Horton’s
Geometric Mean Calculator can’t handle negative numbers. I know you don’t
think you’ll ever have a negative return, but just in case, I show you what to
do. Just add 100 to each of the returns, giving you what you see in Table 8-3.
Figure 8-1:
Horton’s

can do
much of 
the work 
for you.

Enter those returns into the blanks in Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator
labeled Point 1 and Point 2 and so forth. After you have entered the returns,
scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Submit button. At the top of the
page, you see the geometric mean, from which you subtract 100. In this exam-
ple, the geometric mean is 106.20. You just subtract 100 from 106.20, and you
find out your portfolio has a geometric mean return of 6.2%. 
If you’d rather measure your portfolio’s geometric return in a spreadsheet,
Microsoft Excel has a GEOMEAN function that will do it for you. And if you
don’t have Microsoft Excel, you can download a fairly capable spreadsheet
program for free. It’s called OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org). And
although it’s not as slick as Excel, it’s hard to argue with the price. (Open-
Office’s Calc spreadsheet program calls its function the GEOMEAN function
as well.)
Calculating your risk
If you used Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator to measure your portfolio’s
average return, you’ve also measured your risk. At the top of the page, right
below the geometric mean, is the risk, or standard deviation. In this example,
the standard deviation of the portfolio is 18.8 percentage points, as shown in
Figure 8-2.
Microsoft Excel has a function that measures risk. The STDEV function can
measure the standard deviation of returns that you enter. 
Standard deviation works best as a measure of risk if you have many years 
of data to study. If you’ve been investing for only a few months or years, 
you can convert your quarterly results into a yearly or annualized number.
Investopedia (www.investopedia.com/articles/04/021804.asp)
shows you how to do this. If all this seems like too much effort, just use the
online risk-measurement tools described a little later in this chapter.

Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance

What does it all mean? Sizing 
up your portfolio
You did it. You measured your portfolio’s average return and risk. Now what?
You can start by shopping for a new pocket protector. But then, you’ll need to
compare your portfolio’s risk and return with another investment so you can
put it into perspective. You can see how your performance stacks up by com-
paring it with a benchmark called an index. An index is a basket of stocks
used to measure your success. If your portfolio’s risk is higher than the
index’ risk, you want to make sure you’re also getting a higher return. 
Chapter 2 describes most of the popular market indexes. The Standard & Poor’s
500, due to its general acceptance and the fact it closely tracks the stock
market, is the most common index used to size up investors’ returns. If you
want to compare your portfolio’s risk and return to the S&P 500 for the same
time period, you can download the S&P’s annual returns from Standard & Poor’s
by first going to this page — www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/
site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_500/2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,12,
0,0,0,0,0.html — and then clicking on the S&P 500 Historical Returns link at
the bottom of the page. The site opens a spreadsheet. Click the annual total
returns tab and enter those returns into Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator.
The result you get is the S&P 500’s risk and return for the same years.
If you want an easier way to compare returns, you can see how your portfolio
fared relative to the long-term returns of major types of investments, such as
the ones in Table 8-4.

Are your returns lower than the long-term returns on the S&P 500? If so, 
you want to make sure your risk is lower too. You can read the definitions of
corporate bonds, and different types of Treasuries called Treasury bonds,
Treasury notes and Treasury bills in Chapter 16.
Finding other things to compare 
your returns to
You don’t have to compare your stock portfolio to the S&P 500. Investors
commonly choose different indexes to compare their performance to. It’s
important to rank yourself against the right index in order to get a good
understanding of how you’re truly performing. For instance, if you want to
know how fast your sports car is, you’d compare it with another sports car,
not an economy car. You can benchmark your returns against
 More specific indexes: If you’re investing mainly in small company stocks,
you’ll want to compare your results against an index that tracks small com-
pany stocks. iShares’ Index Returns Chart (www.ishares.com/tools
/index_tracker.jhtml) is a colorful and easy-to-use way to find out
how specific areas of the market have performed. You can track stocks of
different sizes, sectors, industries, regions, countries, and commodities.
You can also measure different time frames, such as five days or five years. 
Russell’s Index Returns Calculator (www.russell.com/Indexes/
performance/calculator/calculator.asp) can also help you do
this. You can download a series of annual returns from many types of
stocks, including large company stocks (measured by the Russell 1000)
and small company stocks (measured by the Russell 2000) going back 13
years. You can then enter those returns into Horton’s Geometric Mean
calculator and see how your portfolio stacks up.
205
Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance

Some investors choose to slice the market even more finely when select-
ing a benchmark. For instance, if you invest mainly in large, undervalued
stocks, you would want to compare your performance to a large value
index that owns similar stocks. 
 Broader indexes: The Capital Markets Index (www.cpmkts.com) gives
you an idea of how a diversified basket of stocks, bonds, and money
market investors have performed. You can use this index to measure
your portfolio’s returns. 
 A basket of index mutual funds: Index Funds Advisor (www.ifa.com/
portfolios) has created a number of portfolios of index mutual funds
that can be used as benchmarks. The IFA portfolios are excellent bench-
marks because they are passive index funds designed to deliver the opti-
mum return for the risk taken. You can see where your portfolio would
fit on the risk and reward chart. There’s also a risk and return calculator
(www.ifa.com/portfolios/PortReturnCalc/index.aspx) that
you can use to see what the IFA portfolios have done between specific
time periods. If you’re getting lower returns for higher risk, you might
consider switching to a more passive investment strategy. Table 8-5
shows a sample of some of the returns over the past 20 years.

Using Online Tools to Calculate 
Your Performance
If you understand the inherent value of tracking your portfolio’s performance
but maybe the math involved is just too onerous, you’ve come to the right
section of this chapter. Here I show you automated tools that will crunch
your performance numbers for you. There are three main advantages to let-
ting your computer do the heavy lifting in measuring performance:
206
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Ease: All you have to do is enter your trades, and the computer does the
rest. There’s no need to look up formulas. You also don’t risk making a
mistake in the calculations.
 Speed: The calculations are already programmed in, so after the data is
entered, the system can spit out your performance. There’s no need to
fire up a calculator.
 Customizable: You can tinker and have the system calculate what your
performance would have been, for instance, if you didn’t have that one
stinker in your portfolio. 
Completely relying on online tools to tell you something as important as your
portfolio’s risk and return isn’t ideal. Different sites might use different
methodologies and it might be difficult to find out what precisely is being
measured. With that said, it’s better to rely on online tools than not measure
your portfolio’s risk and return at all.
Looking at online performance 
measurement tools 
Because many new investors are just now getting interested in tracking their
performance, there’s been a flurry of new tools promising to do the job. They
generally fall into these four categories:
 Financial software: This is software you install on your computer that
crunches the math. It includes personal finance software (discussed in
Chapter 1), which contains performance-tracking abilities. There’s also
specialized software designed just to track returns.
 Online stock simulations and social investing sites: Most of the stock
simulation sites (discussed in Chapter 2) and social investing sites (dis-
cussed in Chapter 7) have adequate performance measurement capabili-
ties. I single out a few in this chapter. 
 Portfolio-tracking sites: These services allow you to enter your stock
holdings and help measure your returns. Portfolio-tracking sites are kind
of like Swiss Army knives: they perform a variety of portfolio tracking
tools in addition to measuring your portfolio’s returns. Many portfolio-
tracking sites, for instance, alert you if a stock is about to pay a dividend
or provide links to online news stories about stocks you own.
 Performance-tracking Web sites: These Web sites are designed with the
express purpose of tracking portfolio performance. Because performance-
tracking sites focus on performance tracking, they tend to give a great
deal of information on your portfolio’s risk and return and are very 
precise and exacting.
207
Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance

Using personal finance and performance-
tracking software
If you choose to go the software route, it stands to reason that you’re going
to be buying and/or downloading software and installing it on your PC. This
software runs on your computer and crunches down your returns and some-
times your risk, too. Examples include the following:
 Microsoft’s Money: (www.microsoft.com/money) This Microsoft
product features a portfolio-tracking feature, called Portfolio Manager,
that measures your returns on all the stocks you buy and sell. It’s conve-
nient if you’ve already been using Microsoft Money because you’ve
already downloaded or entered your trades. The software also down-
loads stock quotes automatically, helping you to routinely track your
performance. Portfolio Manager lets you sort all your investments in
dozens of ways, so you can separate your winners from your dogs.
 Intuit’s Quicken: (www.quicken.com) A major player in the financial
software field, Quicken has an advanced Investing Center that monitors
all your returns. What makes Quicken unique is that it measures the
expected risk, or standard deviation, of your portfolio in addition to
returns. Quicken compares your portfolio’s risk with the risk of different
benchmarks, including small and large stocks. You can access this fea-
ture within Quicken by choosing the Portfolio Analyzer feature on the
Investing tab. See Chapter 1 for more information on Quicken and
Money.
 BetterInvesting’s Portfolio Manager: (www.biportfoliomanager.
com/index_bipm.php) BetterInvesting’s entrant in the financial soft-
ware market is an advanced software program designed to meticulously
track your portfolio’s returns. You enter your transactions, and the soft-
ware does the rest with a great level of precision. The software costs
$169 if you’re not a member of the Better Investing organization.
 Analyze Now!: (www.analyzenow.com) Technically, Analyze Now!
doesn’t offer a software program; rather, it provides you with a collec-
tion of free spreadsheets that will help you calculate everything you
need. The Investment Manager spreadsheet not only calculates your
annual returns, but also helps you optimize your tax strategy and pick
the right type of brokerage account. The Free Return Calculator calcu-
lates your portfolio returns even if you moved money in and out of your
account. Select Free Programs on the left-hand side of the Web site to
download the spreadsheets. 
208
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Spreadsheet plug-ins: If you’re already a spreadsheet jockey and want 
to track your performance that way, you need a way to pull current
stock quotes into your spreadsheet. Microsoft provides a free plug-in
that downloads the day’s stock quotes into Excel at www.microsoft.
com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=485FCCD8-9305-4535-
B939-3BF0A740A9B1&displaylang=EN.
The QMatix XLQ plug-in (www.qmatix.com/XLQ.htm) goes a step 
further by pulling both current and historical stock quotes into Excel.
But QMatix software will cost you $74, and other data access charges
might apply.
Using stock simulation and 
social investing sites
Most stock simulation and social investing sites offer performance-tracking
tools. I describe stock simulations in Chapter 2 as a way to get your feet wet
by choosing stocks and investing online. And I cover social investing sites 
in Chapter 7 as a way to connect with other investors. The performance-
tracking capabilities of these sites are noteworthy, including the following
 TradeKing: (www.tradeking.com) This site’s Certified Trades (acces-
sible from the Community menu on the home page) section tracks your
performance. You can share your performance with other TradeKing
members so they can see how talented you are. It’ll also help you deter-
mine which members of TradeKing’s social investing site are worth 
listening to. 
 Marketocracy: (www.marketocracy.com) This social investing site
deserves special mention. It uses a performance measurement tech-
nique that isolates your performance and determines whether it’s the
result of skill or luck. 
 Covestor: (www.covestor.com) In addition to being a leading social
investing site, Covestor also has an impressive performance tracking
tool. It’s one of the few social investing sites that measures both risk 
and return. And it uses the complex Global Investment Performance
Standards, used by professional money management firms, giving you
accurate results. 
Online brokers are so competitive they often look at what others are doing
and match it. Be sure to check with all the online brokers to see whether they
have added any portfolio performance tracking tools. 
209
Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance

Using portfolio-tracking Web sites
Just about all the sites that track market information, described in Chapter 2,
contain portfolio trackers. These sites allow you to enter your holdings or
transactions and then sit back, waiting for them to tell you how much your
stocks are up or down for the day and year and several, including Yahoo!
Finance, let you download your portfolio into a spreadsheet. Portfolio-
tracking sites do many things in addition to measuring performance. Still,
some of these portfolio-tracking sites can have also advanced capabilities,
including the following:
 Morningstar.com: (www.morningstar.com) Morningstar has a stand-
out portfolio tracker because it tells you more than just whether your
stocks went up or down for the day or year. If you click the Performance
tab for your portfolio, you can see how its value has changed over the
past 12 months. Morningstar will also e-mail you each day, telling you
how your portfolio did, or send you alerts when a stock moves up or
down 10% in a day or a mutual fund you own got a new manager. The
Portfolio X-Ray feature applies advanced statistics techniques to see
whether your portfolio fits your needs. Morningstar will import an exist-
ing portfolio you might have saved at MSN Money, Yahoo! Finance or
using personal finance software. The Portfolio X-Ray feature, though, is
available only to subscribers to Morningstar’s premium service, which
costs $145 a year.
 StockSelector.com: (www.stockselector.com) A portfolio service for
the more active trader, StockSelector.com provides ample links to all
sorts of company news and other data designed to help you buy and sell
stocks. Stock Selector routinely spotlights specific stocks its members
are paying attention to, such as the Latest Member Pick available near
the bottom of its main Web page.
 USATODAY.com: (http://portfolio.usatoday.com/custom/
usatoday-com/login/splash.asp) The Portfolio section of the
USATODAY site features a tracking system that’s pretty similar to those
available on other sites. What makes this portfolio tracker unique though,
is that it looks at all the portfolios of all the site’s users and finds which 
50 stocks are the most popular. Those popular stocks, called the USA
TODAY Readers’ Choice 50, are compiled and made available for every-
one to view both in the print edition of USA TODAY and online at www.
usatoday.com/money/markets/readerschoice.htm. You’ll need to
create a free username and password the first time you visit.
Most portfolio-tracking sites make it easy to download your stocks to a
spreadsheet. Using Yahoo! Finance, for instance, you’d scroll to the bottom of
your portfolio, click the Download Spreadsheet link, and then click Save. 
210
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

Using performance-tracking Web sites
Performance-tracking Web sites focus on measuring how your portfolio is
doing. These sites provide much more detail about your portfolio’s risk and
return than general portfolio-tracking Web sites. They take the mathematics
seriously and explain exactly how they’re getting the numbers they are get-
ting. But best of all, their computers do the work so you don’t have to. Sites
to check out include the following:
 RiskGrades: (www.riskgrades.com) As the name suggests, this Web
site is completely focused on risk, which many investors ignore. The site
uses an advanced risk-measurement system to assign either individual
stocks or your portfolio as a whole a RiskGrade. The lower the RiskGrade,
the less risky your portfolio or stock is. A RiskGrade of 0 means the
asset has no volatility. A RiskGrade of 1000 means the asset is ten times
more volatile than one with a RiskGrade of 100. You can also see how
RiskGrades change over time as the factors that affect stocks in the
short term come to bear. (I detail the factors affecting stocks in the short
term in Chapter 6.)
 Profitspi: (www.profitspi.com) This site lets you enter your trades
and quickly calculates your returns. You can sort your stocks to see
which ones are performing the best and instantly compare your results
to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ and Standard & Poor’s
500. You can also download the results to a spreadsheet.
 Icarra: (www.icarra.com) Icarra is primarily a sophisticated perfor-
mance-tracking site that has social investing aspects. It’s one of the few
sites that can calculate your returns similarly to how mutual funds track
their performance — by using the advanced internal rate-of-return
method described earlier in this chapter. Icarra.com also lets you bench-
mark your performance against several major market indexes. You can
share your performance with other users if you choose. 
 Stockalicious: (http://stockalicious.com) This site with the
trendy name allows you to enter your trades and see how your perfor-
mance matches up against the market and other users. It’s designed to
be slightly easier to use than some portfolio-tracking sites. You can also
easily share your trades with your friends.
By measuring your portfolio’s risk and return, you’re already miles ahead 
of many other online investors. You have the know-how to tweak and refine
your investments to make sure you get the optimal return for the risk you’re
taking.

 Using online tools to pick the right asset allocation
 Creating a custom index to track your asset allocation’s success
You wouldn’t sail a ship without a map or bake a cake without a recipe,
but so many online investors do the equivalent when they buy and sell
stocks and other assets without understanding how they fit into a broader
plan. That plan, in investment language, is called an asset allocation. Your
asset allocation determines how much of your portfolio is placed into differ-
ent types of asset classes, or types of investments — typically stocks, bonds,
and cash. By following this plan, you can make sure you get the maximum
return for the amount of risk you’re taking. One controversial study even
claims more than 90% of a portfolio’s swings, on average, is due to the asset
allocation. 
In this chapter, I show you how an asset allocation plan can improve your
success investing online. You also find out how to build your ideal asset allo-
cation using online tools to help you find an allocation that’s right for you. 
The Recipe for Your Online 
Investing: Asset Allocation
Many investors make the mistake of chasing random stocks they hear about,
buying them and throwing them into their portfolios. They pick up stock tips
from TV and neighbors and blindly invest. Some of these investors wind up
owning so many stocks they have an unmanageable portfolio, which gener-
ates disappointing returns. Others try to be more selective and invest in just
a few stocks they think are promising, but they later find out their portfolios
are too risky for their taste. 

The answer is simple: Approach investing like a chef with a recipe in hand.
Rather than tossing all sorts of ingredients into your portfolio pot and guess-
ing what it will taste like, it’s best to know what needs to go into the pot to
get what you want. In investing, this plan is called an asset allocation.
An asset allocation might be general and tell you what percentage of holdings
to put in stocks, how much in bonds, and how much in cash. But it can also
get more detailed and exotic, calling for a dash of large U.S. company stocks,
a pinch of international stocks, and just a touch of bonds. 
Asset allocations are designed to let all the investments in your portfolio
blend together into a stew that will be most likely to generate the highest
possible return for the lowest amount of risk. 
The advantages of creating and sticking with an asset allocation include
 Diversification: Hands down, diversification is the biggest advantage of
having an asset allocation. An asset allocation will call for certain per-
centages of your portfolio to be in certain investments. For instance, you
might put 70% in stocks and 30% in bonds. You want your investments to
be spread into different investments that tend to move up and down at
different times. That will hold the value of your total portfolio steady —
and reduce risk — over time. 
 Rebalancing: A great way to boost your returns without taking on addi-
tional risk, rebalancing pretty much does what the term implies.
Periodically, one group of investments in your asset allocation will fall 
in value. Stocks might fall and bonds rally, for instance. When that hap-
pens, the percentage of your portfolio in stocks will fall below your plan,
and the percentage in bonds will rise. To stick to your allocation and
maintain the percentages, you need to buy more of the investments that
have fallen in value and sell those that have gained. And when you do
that, you will be buying investments when they’re cheaper and selling
them when they get pricier, which isn’t a bad strategy.
 Discipline: Staying in control is priceless with online investing. Because
trading online is so inexpensive and easy, it’s tempting to chase after
popular stocks that are in the news or new investments other investors
are talking about. Many of those investments end up disappointing
investors, though, because they’re overvalued. I explain how to measure
a stock’s valuation in Chapter 13, but if you stick with your asset alloca-
tion, you can avoid this pain. 
What’s so great about diversification? 
If you were to design the perfect portfolio, you’d certainly want the maximum
returns for the least amount of risk. The way you do this is by diversifying, or
spreading your risk over a wide swath of investments. This certainly can
reduce risk, which I define in Chapter 8 as standard deviation. 
214
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

A high standard deviation means the portfolio is riskier, and a low standard
deviation means it’s less risky.
The first aspect of diversification is the idea of safety in numbers. As you add
more stocks to your portfolio, you reduce the odds that a vicious decline in
any one stock will depth-charge your portfolio. 
Before you rush out and buy thousands of stocks, though, you need to be
aware of two things. First, your portfolio’s risk falls by smaller amounts as
you add stocks. For instance, the reduction of risk when you go from 30
stocks to 40 is less impressive than when you go from one stock to two. 
Also, before you start buying every stock you can get your hands on, remem-
ber that there are better ways to buy hundreds of stocks at a time: You can
buy index funds and exchange-traded funds. These single investments are bas-
kets that own hundreds of stocks. So with just one trade, you get the same
benefit of an investor who spends hundreds of dollars in commissions build-
ing a massive portfolio of stocks. That’s why for many investors, buying an
index fund or exchange-traded fund is the optimum strategy. (I talk about
index funds in Chapter 10 and exchange-traded funds in Chapter 11.)
Zig-zag: The second element 
of diversification 
Diversification isn’t just the result of owning many stocks. You can reduce
your risk further by combining different types of assets that zig when the
others zag. Stocks that move differently than each other are said to have little
correlation with each other. Investors build asset allocations by piecing
together investments from popular asset classes such as the following:
 Cash is typically parked in funds that buy short-term IOUs, such as
money market funds. Money market funds are discussed in Chapter 10.
 Bonds are generally longer-term IOUs issued by governments and 
companies. 
 U.S. stocks are the shares of the thousands of companies that trade 
on U.S. stock markets. 
 Foreign stocks are shares in companies that trade on exchanges in other
countries. Foreign investing is covered at more length in a bonus chap-
ter on international and emerging markets at the companion Web site for
this book.
 Emerging market stocks own pieces of companies in up-and-coming
economies. The risk is very high, but the returns can be high, too.
215
Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation

 Real-estate investment trusts (REITs) own commercial property such as
strip malls, apartment buildings or offices. They tend to have low corre-
lation with other asset classes, making them attractive in many asset
allocations. Invest in REITs, a Web site dedicated to REITs, provides a
page that explains the benefits to REITs (www.investinreits.com/
reasons/diversification.cfm). The page, called Diversification
Benefits of REITs, provides a study from market research firm Ibbotson
Associates that explains how REITs can benefit your portfolio.
TIAA-CREF (www.tiaa-cref.org/support/basics/getting_started/
asset_classes.html), a large investment manager that specializes on
retirement planning for people in the education and medical fields, provides
a helpful primer on the different asset classes.
Smart asset allocations put the asset classes together in optimal ways. For
instance, foreign stocks and U.S. stocks don’t move in lockstep with each
other, so they work together well in a portfolio. Bonds and stocks also move
differently. Blending the right doses of these different investments together
helps give you the perfect portfolio and is the very purpose of diversification. 
The degree to which investments move together is called the correlation. 
It’s a complicated mathematical problem that is discussed at more length in
Statistics For Dummies, by Deborah Rumsey (Wiley Publishing), and online 
at www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp. 
Just know this: When an investment moves identically to the market, it has a
correlation of 1 with the market. When an investment moves exactly opposite
to the market, it has a low correlation, or –1. If you can find investments with
a low correlation and add them to your portfolio, you might be able to reduce
your portfolio’s risk. 
The secret to creating a portfolio is a balancing act between three factors:
expected returns, risk, and correlation. Sure you want to pick asset classes
with high returns and low risk, but you also want those asset classes, which
tend to move differently than each other. That way you get the best return
and lowest risk possible. Designing a perfect asset allocation can require
more higher math than a college physics final exam. To make things easy,
later in this chapter, I show you Web sites that can do the number crunching
for you.
But for now, just know that most asset allocations will recommend you own a
certain percentage of stocks, bonds and cash. Some asset allocations, though,
dissect some asset classes, especially U.S. stocks, with even more precision.
U.S. stocks are generally sliced into the categories described in Table 9-1.

Let me explain the boxes in Table 9-1. Each box contains a size, such as large
or small, and a style, such as value or growth. 
Bigger isn’t always better: 
Understanding size
You’ll often see references to large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap
companies when you’re researching asset allocations. Those terms are criti-
cal to asset allocations and are the basis on how online asset allocation sites
work. 
When you hear reference to large-cap companies, for instance, it’s a way 
to describe the company’s total market value or market capitalization. The
market cap is the total price tag the stock market places on a company and 
is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares the com-
pany has outstanding. Market cap is a valuable way for investors to look at
stocks because studies show that companies with similar market values have
similar returns, risk, and correlations. For instance, small companies tend to
have higher returns than large companies, but they’re also riskier. 
That begs the question: What’s a small company and what’s a large company?
That changes over time as the stock market rises and falls. But, Table 9-2
gives you a general idea of where the lines are drawn.

Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation

The definitions of large, medium, and small companies are constantly chang-
ing as the stock market rises and falls. You can look up current definitions
from Russell, a big name in index tracking (www.russell.com/Indexes/
membership/US/Reconstitution/cap_ranges.asp).
Want to know whether a stock you own is a large or small company? Nearly
all the quote services described in Chapter 2 can give you the market value.
You can even type a stock’s symbol into Google (www.google.com), click
the Google Search button and the market value will appear below the stock
price. Just take that market value figure and see where it ranks in Table 9-2. 
Picking investments with the right styles
Companies’ market values aren’t the only thing that matter when it comes to
asset allocations. Some investors also pay attention to stocks’ styles, such as
value and growth. The definition of what makes a value or growth stock isn’t
as cut and dried as market value. You’ll learn ways to decide if a stock is con-
sidered to be a value stock or growth stock in Chapter 13, but for now, just
know that value stocks are those that are generally bargain-priced. Value
stocks tend to be cheaper relative to the earnings and dividends they are gen-
erating. Value stocks, though, are cheaper for a reason: They’re perceived as
being risky because they are in trouble or in a mature industry. Growth stocks,
on the other hand, generally command lofty prices relative to their assets and
earnings because investors expect them to grow rapidly in the future. 
When you put market value, style, and correlation together, you have every-
thing you need to construct a perfect portfolio. These are the building blocks
that help you get the highest return for the amount of risk you’re taking on.
Table 9-3 shows the long-term returns, correlation, and risk of some of the
types of investments suggested by asset allocation sites.

Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation

 IndexInvestor.com: (www.assetallocation.org) Here you can find
in-depth explanations of why asset allocation is so important as well as
guidelines for creating your own asset allocation plan.
Investors commonly make the mistake of thinking their portfolios are diversi-
fied if they own shares of companies in many different industries, such as
energy, financial, and technology. But if you own only shares of a large energy
company, large financial company, and large technology company, you might
not be truly diversified.
How rebalancing steadies your portfolio
When you have an asset allocation, you’re given a recipe that you stick with.
And doing this forces you to be a smart investor by buying more of certain
asset classes when they’re down. It may seem counterintuitive to buy invest-
ments when they’re down. And, to be clear, buying individual stocks when
they’re plunging can be hazardous. Individual stocks are a different animal,
and are explained more fully in Chapter 12 and Chapter 13. But if you invest
in index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that own large baskets of
hundreds of stocks, buying when shares go on sale can be smart because you
lower your cost. This approach, called the rebalancing bonus by respected
financial historian William Bernstein, is described fully here: www.efficient
frontier.com/ef/996/rebal.htm.
Rebalancing is only advised when you’re buying diversified baskets of assets,
such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, which track sections of the
market. Buying individual stocks is a completely different animal. Buying
when a stock is nose-diving is called “catching a falling knife” and can be haz-
ardous to your financial health. 
How discipline will save your portfolio
from getting spanked 
When you have an asset plan, it gives you something to stick to if the markets
get choppy. Sometimes that saves you from yourself and helps you resist the
temptation to chase after the hot stock or an index your neighbors are talking
about. And that’s a good thing because investing in last year’s winner is a
good way to find this year’s loser. 
For instance, large growth stocks were the rage between 1995 and 1998 and
were the top-performers in each of those years with gains of between 24%
and 42% a year, according to Callan Associates. But jumping into the hot
asset class was a bad idea. Between 2000 and 2006, large growth stocks
220
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

underperformed other stocks badly. The Callan Periodic Table of Investment
Returns (www.callan.com/resource/periodic_table/PertblDark.
pdf) uses a color-coded chart that shows how asset classes rarely stay 
on top.
Using and Finding Your Perfect 
Asset Allocation
There are three main ways to design your asset allocation
 Follow guidelines. These simple rules, available on Web sites I point
out, are great if you just want to keep things simple. 
 Take a risk-based approach. Calculate how much risk you can tolerate
and select a blend of investments to give you the highest return for that
risk. 
 Take a return-based approach. You can work backwards and measure
how much return you need to meet your goal and design a portfolio that
will get you there. 
In this chapter, I help you choose an asset allocation, which gives you a
roadmap of the types of investments you should buy to get the returns you’re
looking for. But an asset allocation doesn’t do you any good if you don’t act
on it. In Chapter 10, I show you how to buy the investments your asset alloca-
tion calls for by picking the right mutual funds. Chapter 11 gives you the low-
down on exchange-traded funds, and in Chapter 13, I show you how to find
individual stocks that match your asset allocation. 
Determining your current asset allocation
If you own any investments now, you already have an asset allocation. It just
might not be what you think it is, and it might not be designed to give you the
returns and risk you want. It’s important to understand what types of invest-
ments you own currently and what your current asset allocation is. You can
do this by using the following:
 Personal finance software: The big players here are Microsoft’s Money
and Intuit’s Quicken. Both can classify all the stocks, bonds, and mutual
funds in your portfolio and tell you what percentage of your holdings are
in each. You can read more about both in Chapter 1.

Using guidelines
If you’re the kind of investor who wants to have an asset allocation but 
doesn’t want to delve into all the complications, this method is for you. The
resources covered in the next sections make asset allocation easy, either by

or letting you choose from simple but effective allocations. 
Intuit’s Quicken financial software
Quicken has a helpful Asset Allocation Guide that lets you choose from sev-
eral off-the-shelf asset allocations. You can look them over and decide which
one gives you the level or return you’re interested in at the amount of risk
you can tolerate, such as conservative, moderate, or aggressive. 
EasyAllocator.com 
The EasyAllocator site (http://easyallocator.com), shown in Figure 9-3,
is true to its name. After signing in or creating a new account ( free, by the
way) just click the Allocator tab and enter the balances of your taxable and
retirement accounts. When you’re done, click the GO button. EasyAllocator
doesn’t help you decide how much risk you can tolerate. It leaves that up to
you and asks you to decide by marking Very High, Very Low, or something in-
between in the Risk Tolerance question. EasyAllocator does let you tailor
your asset allocation a bit by deciding what types of stocks you want included
or excluded. You can leave out micro-cap or real-estate stocks, for instance.
The site then breaks down your asset allocation for you and tells you what
your risk exposure will be if you use that allocation. Even better, it recom-
mends specific low-cost index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds you
should buy, and gives you the ticker symbols.

Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation

EasyAllocator is one of the few systems that looks at all your accounts,
including your taxable and retirement accounts, as a whole. This is a smart
approach. Not only does EasyAllocator create an allocation, but it shows you
the types of investments to hold in which types of accounts to save yourself
taxes. The tax advantages of certain accounts are explained in Chapter 3. But
EasyAllocator does much of the work for you.
For instance, if you’re going to own bonds, you could own them in a retire-
ment account. That way, when the bonds pay interest, you don’t have to pay
the tax until you withdraw the money, which could be in 30 years. Meanwhile,
your taxable accounts are good places for your holdings in stock index funds
that don’t generate large dividends. Lastly, if you own risky investments with
large expected returns, such as emerging market stocks, you should put them
in your Roth IRA. That way, you’ll never have to pay tax on the large gains
you’re likely to obtain. 
Efficient Frontier
Efficient Frontier (www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/cowards.htm)
is a site managed by well-known and well-respected market scholar and advi-
sor William Bernstein. He suggests a Coward’s Portfolio, which he says is
designed to be an easy way for investors to build a solid portfolio with inter-
national exposure. He also suggests which mutual funds to buy to match the
portfolio. 
Scott Burns’ Couch Potato portfolio 
Scott Burns has put together a site (www.dallasnews.com/shared

appeals to anyone who appreciates the simple. In his role as financial colum-
nist for Dallas Morning News, Burns recommends the easiest-to-follow alloca-
tion you can find: 50% stocks and 50% bonds. Put half your money in an index
fund that tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500, which I discuss in Chapter 10, and
half in one that tracks the bond market and you’re done. That’s it. Burns

Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System 
Manifesting some good Midwestern common sense, the folks at the Iowa
Public Employees’ Retirement System have set up a free and easy-to-use
online tool that gives you an idea of what your dream allocation would be
(www.ipers.org/calcs/AssetAllocator.html). You tell the system
how old you are, how much you have, how much you save, your tax rate, and
your risk tolerance by moving a series of sliders back and forth. It then spits
out your asset allocation.
SmartMoney.com Asset Allocator 
Part of the Dow Jones publishing empire, SmartMoney’s Web site has come
up with its own asset allocator (www.smartmoney.com/oneasset). The
tool lets you move various sliders to indicate your personal preferences for
risk and return, just like the one from Iowa. If you enter your current port-
folio, the Asset Allocator tells you the dollar amount you must sell or buy of
each investment type to achieve your ideal asset allocation.
AARP Asset Allocation Planner 
It should come as no surprise that the American Association of Retired
People has its own asset allocator (www.aarp.org/bulletin/yourmoney/

questions to help you understand how much you should invest in cash,
stocks, and bonds. 
Gummy Stuff 
Coming straight from the Great White North, the Gummy Stuff site is chock-
full of tutorials, spreadsheets, and financial tools, including an asset allocator
(www.gummy-stuff.org/allocations.htm). It lets you play with differ-
ent asset allocations and see how you would have done. 
Picking an asset allocation based 
on your risk tolerance
Some investors may decide they want to tailor their asset allocation with a
bit more precision for their individual taste. And if you’re like most investors,
the disappointment you feel when your portfolio falls more than you’d like is
definitely greater than any happiness you might feel at eking out a slightly
better-than-expected return. That’s why online tools that assess your
appetite for risk, and then design a portfolio, make sense for many investors.
A few to try include the following:
225
Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation

 IFA.com: (www.ifa.com/SurveyNET/index.aspx) The folks at Index
Fund Advisors offer a Risk Capacity Survey — mentioned in Chapter 1 —
as a way to determine what kind of investor you are. The survey asks
you a battery of questions to assess how much risk you can take, which
is the way it recommends a portfolio to you. The Quick Risk Capacity
survey has just five questions, and a longer survey has 25 questions.
After you answer the questions, the Web site suggests one of several
portfolios. The most risk-tolerant investors are pointed to Portfolio 100,
and risk-adverse investors to Portfolio 5. 
IFA’s asset allocations are much more detailed than some of the sites
that provide guidelines. For instance, rather than suggesting owning
large-cap stocks, IFA.com distinguishes between large-cap stocks and
large-cap value-priced stocks. The portfolios also recommend specific
index funds sold by asset management firm Dimensional Fund Advisors,
which you can buy through a financial advisor licensed to sell them.
 Vanguard’s Investor Questionnaire: (https://flagship.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/FundsInvQuestionnaire) This section of the Van-
guard site, shown in Figure 9-4, asks you ten questions in an attempt to
try and figure out how much risk you can stomach. At the end, the site
recommends that you own certain mixes of short-term reserves, stocks
and cash. You can view all the recommended portfolios at https://

 CNNMoney: (http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/assetalloc
wizard/assetallocwizard.html) CNNMoney steps you through
four questions designed to figure out what kind of risk taker you are. It
then generates a fairly basic asset allocation mix. 
 Asset-Analysis: (www.asset-analysis.com/assetalloc/aaquest.
html) With a name like Analysis of Asset Allocation, you can’t go wrong,
right? This section of the site steps you through five questions that mea-
sure your appetite for risk. When you’re done, the site determines how
much risk you can take and tells you how much of your portfolio should
be invested in cash, bonds, emerging markets, domestic stocks, real
estate, and international stocks. 
Picking an asset allocation 
based on your goals
The other way to figure out how to allocate your portfolio is to first deter-
mine what kind of rate of return you need to reach your goal and then pick an
asset allocation that will get you there. Several of the asset allocation sites
take this approach: 
 MSN Money’s Asset Allocator (http://moneycentral.msn.com/
investor/calcs/assetall/main.asp), which starts by asking you
the rate of return you desire. You can choose a rate of return between
4.5% and 11.5%, and then the site crunches down the right mix of 
investments. 
Want to calculate the rate of return you need to reach a goal? Try Money
Chimp’s Return Rate Calculator (www.moneychimp.com/calculator/
discount_rate_calculator.htm). Just enter how much money you
have now, how much you need to have, and when you need to have it,
and the calculator tells you the rate of return you need.
 TIAA CREF’s Asset Allocation Evaluator (https://ais2.tiaa-cref.
org/cgi-bin/WebObjects.exe/DTAssetAlcEval), which designs
your allocation based on what your goal is, as shown in Figure 9-5. The
first question it asks is what you’re saving for, such as retirement, educa-
tion, or a first home. The site then asks you additional questions that are
relevant to that specific goal.

much you’ll earn based on 50-year historical returns of cash, stocks, and
bonds. You can then tweak the allocation to see whether you can get the
rate of return that you need.

O
nline investing isn’t just for individual stock pickers. The Internet can
also be used to pick, track, and monitor investments in mutual funds —
funds that pool money from many investors so that it can then be invested 
in stocks, bonds or other assets. By pooling money, mutual funds give small
investors some of the benefits enjoyed by larger investors, especially the
ability to spread money over many investments, or diversify. Mutual funds
are the way most people invest. More than 96 million individual investors,
and half the nation’s households, own a piece of mutual funds. U.S. mutual
funds hold more than $10.4 trillion in investor assets, which they pool
together and use to buy stakes in investments. 
In this chapter, I explain how online tools can maximize your success invest-
ing in mutual funds. I also show you how to use online tools to pick the right
investments for you and walk you through the process of setting up an
account to buy or sell the funds. 
The Feeling Is Mutual: Understanding
Mutual Funds
If all the work it takes to pick individual stocks, described in Chapters 12 
and 13, sounds exhausting, mutual funds might be for you. By their design,
mutual funds give investors what they’re looking for with minimal work. Most

mutual funds own large baskets of stocks, giving investors the benefit of
diversification (as described in Chapter 9) right off the bat. And mutual funds
come in many flavors, allowing investors to buy exactly what they want, such
as specific types of stocks or industries. Want to own small value-priced
stocks? No problem, there’s a mutual fund you can buy that takes care of it.
Passive investors can also buy index mutual funds, which match market
indexes and charge low fees. Active investors can choose from actively man-
aged mutual funds that rely on human stock pickers who try to beat the
market (although very few do). 
There’s just one problem. The sheer number of mutual funds is so enormous
that it’s hard to know where to start. There were 8,120 mutual funds at the
end of 2006. That’s greater than the 5,906 stocks trading on the New York
Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Meanwhile, the amount of money invested in
funds, called net assets, also continues to swell. 
Considering the pros of mutual funds
Just because mutual funds are so popular, though, that doesn’t mean they’re
right for you. You might decide that buying individual stocks is more your
speed. Even so, it’s worth first considering what you gain and lose by invest-
ing in mutual funds. First, what you gain:
 Instant diversification: If you buy just one mutual fund, you own a piece
of dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks. Buying a share of a fund is more
cost effective than buying and managing hundreds of stocks yourself. 
 Easy asset allocation: As I explain in Chapter 9, it’s important to have an
asset allocation that helps guide you in what kinds of stocks you should
buy to get more return for the amount of risk you’re taking on. Some of
these asset allocations get pretty specific, calling for a certain percent-
age of your portfolio to be in small value-priced stocks or large stocks.
You can easily pick up the right exposure by buying mutual funds dedi-
cated to these sizes and styles. Buying just five or more mutual funds can
give you an easy-to-manage and completely diversified portfolio. 
 Low fees: By pooling your money with many other investors’, you gain
significant cost savings. Large mutual fund companies can save money
on commissions, research, and other fees, which means they pay less
than what you’d have to pay if you were doing all this on your own.
Mutual funds must also disclose their fees, so you can quickly find those
that are the most efficient. The Securities and Exchange Commission
(www.sec.gov/investor/tools/mfcc/mfcc-int.htm) describes
how fees can eat into your returns.
230
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

If you’re interested in keeping your costs down, index mutual funds have
extremely low fees, sometimes less than 0.1% a year. If a fund charges
0.1%, that means if you have $1,000 invested, you pay just a $1 fee 
that year.
Drawbacks of mutual funds 
worth considering
Despite mutual funds’ advantages, they have some significant drawbacks that
might be deal killers for you:
 Lack of control: When you buy a mutual fund, you’re putting your
investment in the hands of an investment company. If you invest with an
actively managed fund, which hires a professional portfolio manager to
select stocks for the fund to buy, you don’t have much say in investment
decisions. If the manager sells a stock — one you think is a good long-
term hold, for instance — there’s nothing you can do about it. This is the
case with index mutual funds, too. If a stock is added to the S&P 500, for
instance, your S&P 500 index fund will buy the stock, too.
 Tax inefficiencies: When mutual funds buy and sell stocks during the
year, their actions often create result in tax bills you weren’t expecting.
The most unfortunate type occurs when a fund sells a stock for a gain. 
Yes, you have to pay tax when you sell an individual stock for a gain. But
you can decide when to sell that stock. Mutual funds may sell stocks for
gains anytime, including a time that’s not good for you. That gain is then
distributed to you, the mutual fund owner, and you must pay tax on it.
Capital-gain distributions often come with no warning and can spoil a
well-thought out tax plan. This tends to be much less of an issue with
index mutual funds because the turnover, or number of stocks bought
and sold, tends to be lower than with actively managed funds.
231
Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
Capital-gain distribution nightmare
Capital-gain distributions are one of the biggest
drawbacks of actively managed mutual funds.
These distributions can be very large and unex-
pected, two things you don’t want when it
comes to managing your taxes. Consider the
whopper of a capital-gain distribution paid by
Fidelity’s Magellan mutual fund in 2006. After the
fund changed portfolio managers, the new man-
ager cleaned house and sold off giant chunks of
stocks owned by the fund under the previous
manager. That resulted in 19% of the fund’s
assets, or more than $22 a share, to be distrib-
uted to shareholders. Making things worse, if a
portfolio manager sells stocks owned for a year
or less for a gain, shareholders who own the
funds in a taxable account can get hit with high
short-term capital gains taxes. Capital gains
taxes are explained in detail in Chapter 3.

 Index shadowing: The most sinister actively managed funds are those
that pretend to be adding value by picking winning stocks but are 
actually just tracking or shadowing the market. It’s unfortunate when
this happens because investors are paying for the expertise of a fund
manager but not getting anything in return. These investors could get
the same results, and save money on fees, by investing in low-cost 
index funds. 
Types of Investment Companies 
Investment-fund companies are usually structured in one of two ways. The
structure dictates how the value of the fund is determined and how you buy
and sell your shares. The main types of structures are the following:
 Open-end investment companies: These folks are all mutual funds, 
all the time. Open-end investment companies — also known as fund
companies — buy baskets of stocks and then sell pieces of the portfolios
they’ve assembled to outside investors. The price of a share of a mutual
fund is set at the end of each day when the fund company adds up the
value of the shares it owns and divides by the number of shares out-
standing. The result, called the net asset value (NAV), is what one share
of the mutual fund is worth. The NAV is how much the mutual fund com-
pany would pay you if you redeemed, or sold, your shares. You can
redeem or purchase shares through most of the online brokers dis-
cussed in Chapter 4 or directly from the fund companies.
How do you find a mutual fund’s NAV? Nearly all the sites that provide
stock quotes, described in Chapter 2, provide the mutual fund’s NAV if
you enter the fund’s symbol. Some sites provide additional information
about the fund. For instance, Morningstar also tells you
• Performance of the fund compared to other similar funds and the
closest benchmark.
• Long-term returns going back three and five years.
• Total assets invested with the fund. This is a tally of how much
investor money is invested in the fund. 
• Portfolio managers’ names.
• Dividend yield, if any.
• Expense ratio, which is an important area that’s discussed more
fully later, in the section “Deciphering the morass of mutual 
fund fees.”
• Purchase information. There is a link to the fund company to help
you find out how to invest.
232
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Closed-end investment companies are part mutual fund, part stock. Like
open-end investment companies, closed-end funds buy portfolios of
stocks. But closed-end funds don’t redeem shares held by investors
directly. Instead, shares of closed-end funds trade on the stock market
just like a regular stock. That means the price is set very differently than
with mutual funds. Investors study the value of the stocks in the closed-
end portfolios and decide how much the basket is worth. The price of
the fund moves during the day as buyers and sellers agree on a price.
The fact investors set the price on closed-end funds often creates an
interesting situation where the price of the closed-end fund is less than
the value of the stocks owned by the fund. When that happens, that
means the closed-end fund is trading at a discount.
You can find all the closed-end investment companies that are trading
for a discount by logging into Morningstar’s closed-end fund center
(http://news.morningstar.com/CELists/CEReturns.html?
fsection=CELists) and clicking the Premiums/Discounts column
twice to sort by funds trading for a discount.
You can also find out more about closed-end funds in general at the
Investment Company Institute (www.ici.org/statements/inv/
bro_g2_ce.html) as well as at the Closed-End Fund Association (www.
closed-endfunds.com).
Categorizing Mutual Funds
Because there are more mutual funds than stocks, it’s probably not too sur-
prising that there are also many types of mutual funds. Mutual funds at their
most basic level come in four basic flavors: those that invest in stock funds,
bond funds, money market funds, and hybrid funds. But if you drill down, you
find even more categories. The following sections give you a sense of how
categories and subcategories branch off from each other.
Stock funds
Stock funds invest in shares of publicly traded companies. These funds typi-
cally go for large gains by pursuing one of a number of strategies:
 Growth funds are filled with shares of companies investors generally
expect to expand their earnings the fastest. Portfolio managers of
actively managed growth funds are typically willing to pay higher valua-
tions for growth stocks because they think the companies are worth it.
233
Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds

Growth index funds buy shares of companies that have the highest valu-
ations, often measured by the price-to-book ratio, a concept I explain in
more detail in Chapter 13. 
If you’re young and retirement is still years off, many experts advise to
invest in growth funds. The trouble, though, is that academic studies
have shown growth funds, including growth index funds, tend to own
the most overvalued stocks. That means they tend to have lower future
returns and higher risk than value funds that own less glamorous stocks.
 Value funds own companies that are generally out of fashion or consid-
ered to be ho-hum and mature by Wall Street. Actively managed value
funds are constructed by portfolio managers trained to look for under-
valued stocks, or stocks that sell for less than what they’re truly worth.
Value index funds generally own stocks that have the lowest valuations. 
 Income stock funds seek to invest in companies that pay fat dividends,
such as utilities and real-estate investment trusts (REITs). Income stock
funds aren’t looking for stock price appreciation.
 International funds invest 80% or more of their money in companies
located outside the U.S. Some international funds concentrate on spe-
cific areas of the world, such as Europe or Japan. Yet others, called
emerging markets funds, focus on up-and-coming parts of the world.
 Global funds invest in companies in any part of the world, including 
the U.S.
 Sector funds pick specific industries investors often like to invest in,
such as technology, energy, and utilities.
Bond funds
Bond funds own diverse baskets of bonds, which usually have similar charac-
teristics. Bond funds are generally seen as a way to reduce risk because they
collect income from a variety of borrowers. If one borrower defaults on the
loan, you own many other bonds and aren’t wiped out. There are many types
of bond funds, which I will discuss in more detail in Chapter 16. The main
ones to know about are the following:
 Government bond funds tend to invest in debt issued by the U.S. gov-
ernment. These funds usually invest in Treasuries that mature in the
short-term, intermediate term, or long-term, or a blend of each. 
 High-yield bond funds, nicknamed junk bond funds, generate higher
returns by investing in debt issued by companies with shakier finances.
The overall risk is reduced by spreading the investment over many com-
panies’ debt. 
234
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Corporate bond funds own bonds issued by large companies. Their
yields are generally higher than those paid by government bonds but
less than high-yield bonds.
 Municipal bond funds invest in debt issued by state and local govern-
ments. These bonds can be attractive because they’re usually not taxed
by the federal government. 
Money market funds
Money market funds are a great place to park cash you might need at short
notice. They invest in very low risk short-term Treasuries issued by the fed-
eral government or IOUs from banks. Money market funds can be great
places to get a decent return on cash you’ve set aside for emergencies. The
SEC (www.sec.gov/answers/mfmmkt.htm) provides more information
about money market funds.
Hybrid funds
Hybrid funds blend aspects of all the types of funds in the preceding sections
into a unique package that suits some investors. Some examples include the
following:
 Balanced funds split their portfolios into a preset mix of bonds and
stocks. Investors who want to diversify their holdings between stocks
and bonds can in theory just buy one of these and leave it up to the
portfolio manager.
 Target date funds are an increasingly popular type of investment where
you tell the mutual fund company how old you are and it determines the
right mix of investments for you. It will split your money into a preset
blend of stocks and bonds. As you age, and your appetite for risk declines,
the funds automatically shift your portfolio to be more weighted toward
bonds and away from stocks. TargetDatePortfolio (www.targetdate
portfolio.com) provides additional information about these types of
funds and can help you find some that might fit your needs.
 Fund of funds are mutual funds that buy other mutual funds. The idea is
that these funds can assemble a collection of mutual funds so you don’t
have to.
235
Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds

What to Look for in a Mutual Fund
When you’re shopping for a fund, you want to have a checklist of all the
things that are important. Pay attention to the following things:
 The fund’s style: If your asset allocation calls for investing in large value-
priced stocks, you want to go with a fund that invests in large value-priced
stocks. Sounds easy, right? Watch out, though, because the name of a
mutual fund might make it sound like one thing, when in reality it’s 
something else. 
How could this “what’s in a name” business affect you? Say you’re debat-
ing between two mutual funds that claim to invest in small stocks. Both
have the words “small stock” in their names, but the funds might define
small stock differently.
Finding out which one owns smaller stocks is easy. Log in to the site of
mutual fund tracker Morningstar (www.morningstar.com), enter the
first mutual fund’s ticker symbol, press Enter, and then click the
Portfolio link on the left of the new page that appears. You see the fund’s
average market value, which measures how much the average stock
held by the fund is worth. Do the same for the other fund and compare
the results. If you want a small-cap fund, make sure the average market
value falls in the small range in the chart in Chapter 9. Figure 10-1 shows
you what happens when you check the Vanguard 500 Index’s portfolio.

Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Long-term performance: It’s tempting to chase after mutual funds that
did the best last year or in the last decade. But studies have shown
explosive mutual funds are rarely able to maintain their streaks. You
should concentrate on a fund’s five- or ten-year track record, at the least.
If you can get performance data going back further, that’s even better.
And always compare a mutual fund’s performance to the comparable
index. If you’re looking to buy a mutual fund that invests in large value-
priced stocks, you should compare its performance to a large value
index. 
 Turnover: The amount of buying and selling a fund does is called its
turnover. It’s important to keep turnover low because when your fund
sells stocks, you can face serious tax consequences if it causes capital-
gain distributions.
 Ratings: Mutual fund trackers Morningstar (www.morningstar.com)
and Lipper (www.lipperweb.com) rank mutual funds based on many
dimensions of their performance. Although you can’t rely solely on
these rankings, they’re worth paying attention to. Plus they’re easy to
understand.
 Size: There’s a dilemma when shopping for actively managed mutual
funds. When they get too large and have huge chunks of money to
invest, performance usually suffers as they struggle to find enough
investments to plow the money into. A general guideline on this is if you
own a fund that invests in large companies, it might be getting too big
when it has $50 billion in assets. You can find out how much money is
invested in a fund by logging in to Morningstar.com, entering the fund’s
symbol, typing enter, and checking out the default Snapshot page. 
Popular funds attempt to stop themselves from getting too bloated by
closing to new investors. When this happens, if you were already an
investor in the fund, you can add money, but you can’t buy the fund if
you’re not already an investor.
Being too small can be a problem, too. If a fund doesn’t attract enough
assets, it might be shut down. 
 Fees: The fees are how much the fund charges you every year to invest
your money. The fees charged by your fund are typically taken annually
no matter what. That means even if the fund falls in value, you pay fees.
That’s why fees are one of the most important things to pay attention to.
They’re so important that the next section is dedicated to understand-
ing them. 
Actively managed mutual funds tempt investors with the promise that their
portfolio managers are so smart they can beat the market. The reality,
though, is very few beat the market consistently, and they wind up charging
investors fees for a promise that’s never realized. A look at history shows
how the odds are stacked against active mutual fund managers. Of the funds
237
Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds

that existed in 1970, only 37% were still around by 2005, according to John
Bogle (www.vanguard.com/bogle_site/sp20060515.htm), founder of
Vanguard, which pioneered the low-cost index mutual fund. The other 63% of
mutual funds were shut down due to poor performance. Even if you picked
one of the survivors, you didn’t necessarily score. Of the funds that lasted,
45% lagged the stock market, and 36% turned in performance that nearly
matched the market. That means just 7% of the funds that existed in 1970
beat the stock market by more than one percentage point a year. That’s why
investing in a low-cost index fund, for many investors, is often the best
option.
Deciphering the morass 
of mutual fund fees
Mutual fund performance swings up and down, along with the stocks and
bonds the fund is invested in. But one thing that’s for sure, the mutual fund
company will make sure to collect its cut.
If you’re not careful, mutual funds can sting you with all sorts of fees. The
good thing, though, is that all fees must be disclosed ahead of time so you
can avoid expensive funds if you know what to look for. The short list of
things to be on the lookout for includes the following:
 Front-end loads are charged to investors immediately when they buy a
fund. These fees are the most sinister because a bite is taken out of your
portfolio even before you get started. Investor outcry has helped to
drive these fees down to 1.3% in 2006 from 5.6% in 1980. Regulators
don’t allow funds to charge more than 8.5%. You can read more about
how the regulators oversee fees from the Securities and Exchange
Commission (www.sec.gov/answers/mffees.htm). You can usually
spot a fund charging a front-end load because it sells what’re called
Class A shares.
 Back-end loads are essentially commissions charged when you redeem
shares. They’re also called contingent deferred sales and will sometimes
be waived if you own the mutual fund shares long enough. For instance,
you’ll be socked with a 5% fee if you redeem shares in a year or less, 4%
if you redeem in two years, and the fee keeps falling until it vanishes
after you own the fund for five years. Back-end loads include so-called
12b-1 fees that the fund company charges shareholders to promote its
fund. These fees cannot exceed 0.75% of the fund net assets per year to
pay for marketing costs. Funds that charge back-end loads are desig-
nated as Class B shares.
238
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Redemption fees are charged when shareholders redeem, or sell, their
shares. Redemption fees are technically different from back-end loads
because the fees go to paying the costs that arise from your redemption.
But they sting just the same. Regulators prohibit redemption fees from
exceeding 2% of the amount sold. 
 Purchase fees are charged when shareholders buy shares of a fund. This
fee might not be called a front-load fee, but it is still a fee you must pay
upfront and costs you money. 
 Management fees are the ongoing fees the mutual fund charges you to
run your money. 
 Other fees include exchange fees if you shift money into a different fund
owned by the same mutual fund company, or an account fee if you, for
instance, don’t meet a minimum account balance.
Although it might seem like the number of charges levied by mutual funds are
limitless, mutual fund fees have been falling. The average fees and expenses
collected by stock mutual funds were 1.1% in 2006, down from 2.3% in 1980.
And the fees of bond funds have fallen to 0.8% from 2.1% during the same
time period.
No-load mutual funds don’t charge front or back-end load fees. But that doesn’t
mean they’re free. Even no-load funds can charge redemption, purchase,
exchange, and management fees. 
You can easily find out online how much a fund charges in fees. Enter the
symbol at Morningstar.com and click the Fees & Expenses link on the left in
the new page that appears. The site shows you both the initial (front-end
load) and deferred fees (back-end load) plus all other fees, including 12b-1
and management fees on a screen like the one in Figure 10-2. Morningstar
also shows you how much the fees will eat from your portfolio over the next
three, five, and ten years.
Before paying a load, be absolutely certain there isn’t a less expensive mutual
fund/index mutual fund that will accomplish the same thing for you. The
Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov/investor/tools/
mfcc/mfcc-intsec.htm) provides a fee calculator that shows just how
costly fees can be. Personal Fund (http://personalfund.com) can also
analyze mutual funds’ fees and calculate how much they will cost you.

Finding mutual funds that work for you
With so many mutual funds to choose from, you need your computer’s help
to find the ones best suited to you. You can use computerized screening tools,
which scour a database of all mutual funds, looking for criteria you select. A
number of Web sites provide such screening tools, including the following:
 Morningstar: (www.morningstar.com) That Morningstar is on the list
shouldn’t come as a surprise. To pinpoint the types of funds you’re look-
ing for, just click the Funds tab on the Morningstar home page, scroll
down a bit and then click the Fund Screener link under the Find a Fund
header on the left side of the page. You can screen mutual funds based
on everything from the type of fund, such as large-value, to funds with
expense ratios below certain levels, low turnover, average market values
of specific amounts and ten-year returns that you choose. You can even
exclude funds that charge loads or only view funds that have received
Morningstar’s highest ratings. When you’re done entering all your crite-
ria, click the Show Results tab, and you get a list of all the funds that
meet your standards.

It’s generally a good idea to stick with mutual funds that charge total
fees of well below 1.5%. 
 Lipper: (www.lipperweb.com) The other big-name mutual fund
tracker, Lipper, lets you begin a search by clicking the Fund Screener link
on the right side of its home page. You can narrow your search by type
of fund (such as stock or bond) or classification (size and fund family,
for instance). You can also limit your search to funds that receive
Lipper’s top rating in five categories, including total return, consistent
return, preservation, tax efficiency, and expense. 
 MSN Money Mutual Fund Screener: (http://moneycentral.msn.
com/investor/finder/customfunds.asp) This corner of the MSN
Money site offers an easy-to-use system that lets you search for very
specific funds that meet your needs. You can also save your search crite-
ria in case you want to try again later.
Many of the discount online brokers provide free access to mutual fund
screening tools, most of which are based on either Morningstar or Lipper
data.
How to buy mutual funds 
with an online broker
You have two main ways to buy mutual funds: directly from the mutual fund
company or through a broker. 
Nearly all the online brokers discussed in Chapter 4 let you buy mutual
funds. Buying this way is convenient because your mutual fund holdings will
be listed on your account statements next to your stock investments. 
To buy a mutual fund this way, just log in to your account and enter the
mutual fund’s stock symbol and proceed to buy it just as you’d buy a stock.
The online broker’s site then gives you the NAV (net asset value) from the
previous day. (After the stock market closes, the mutual fund determines the
NAV for the day. That NAV, measured after the market closes, determines the
price you pay for the shares.)
Some online brokers charge exorbitant commissions for buying and selling
mutual funds. Table 10-1 shows you some sample commissions from a few
top online brokers.

Online brokers often offer a number of transaction-free mutual funds that you
can buy and sell for no commission. Just be careful, though, because these
online brokers also usually hit you with a short-term redemption fee, even on 
a transaction-free mutual fund, if you sell the fund too quickly after buying it.
These fees are usually around $50.  
How to buy mutual funds without a broker
You might not want to fuss with getting a broker, or perhaps you hate being
limited to the transaction-free mutual funds. You might be a candidate for
buying shares directly from the mutual fund companies. This might save you
money because mutual fund companies typically don’t charge commissions. 
If you’re interested in buying a fund that isn’t one of the transaction-free
choices with a broker, it’s best to buy directly from the fund company to
avoid paying commissions. It’s especially a good idea if you plan to periodi-
cally make small investments, which could ring up hefty fees if you use a
broker.
To buy mutual funds from a mutual fund company, you need to set up an
account, which you can do pretty quickly online. After you decide which fund
you’d like to buy, just log in to the fund company’s site and click a link that’s
usually labeled Open an Account. You have to answer the same questions
needed to open an online brokerage account, described in Chapter 4, includ-
ing your address and type of account (individual or joint). You also need to
tell the mutual fund company whether you want dividends deposited to your
account or used to buy additional shares of the fund. You can fill out the
application online in about 20 minutes or print it and mail it in.

Most mutual fund companies offer Automatic Monthly Investment programs
(AMI). If you sign up for an AMI, the fund company automatically takes money
from your bank savings or checking account each month. It’s a good way to
make sure you’re regularly saving money. Some funds will even let you start
with a smaller initial investment if you sign up for the AMI.

Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds

Comparing Mutual Funds to Each Other
When you’re choosing a mutual fund, it’s always a good idea to compare sev-
eral similar funds to each other to make sure you’re getting the best one for
your needs. You want to consider both the fund’s characteristics and risk. 
Putting funds’ characteristics side by side
MSN Money (http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/home.asp)
offers a useful tool that lets you compare mutual funds. For instance, it shows
you the average price-to-earnings ratios of all the stocks the funds hold. The
price-to-earnings ratio, discussed at more length in Chapter 13, is one way to
see how pricey stocks are. Just visit the site and click the Research Wizard
link on the menu on the left-hand side of the page — right under the Funds
heading. Enter the first mutual fund’s symbol and hit the Go button. This
takes you to the fund’s snapshot page. Click the Comparison link under the
Guided Research heading on the left-hand side of the page. In the Enter a
Symbol to Compare blank, enter the symbol of a mutual fund or two you’d
like to size up based on all the key factors and click the Compare button.
Analyzing a mutual funds’ risk
Understanding the potential returns you might enjoy from a fund is just half
of the equation. It’s equally — if not even more — important to know how
much risk you’re taking on to get the return. Many of the same online tools
used to measure your portfolio’s risk, explained in Chapter 9, can be used to
gauge your mutual fund’s risk, too. 
Online mutual fund investors, though, can get additional information about
risk from Morningstar. Enter the mutual fund’s ticker symbol at Morningstar.
com in the Quotes blank at the top left-hand side of the page and press Enter.
Next, click the Risk Measures link on the left side of the new page that
appears. You see all the vital measures of the fund’s risk, including 
 Standard deviation: As explained in Chapter 8, standard deviation is a
way to measure an investment’s risk. All you really need to know is that
the higher the standard deviation, the higher the fund’s risk. 
 Sharpe Ratio: This measure gives you, at a glance, an idea of how 
much bang you’re getting from the mutual fund for the risk you’re taking.
The higher the Sharpe Ratio — named after Nobel Laureate William
Sharpe — the more return you’re getting for the risk.
244
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 R-Squared: This measure helps you figure out how much of a fund’s
movement is due to the judgment of the portfolio manager and how much
is due to the movements of the stock market. The closer R-Squared is to
100, the more the fund mirrors what’s going on the stock market. An
index fund tracking the S&P 500, for instance, would have an R-Squared
of very close to 100.
Don’t pay a mutual fund manager high fees for just investing in an index.
You could pay much less and just buy an index fund. To know whether
your manager is shadowing the market, look at R-Squared. If an actively
managed fund you own has an R-Squared close to 100, consider dumping
it and buying an index fund.
 Beta: Measures how sensitive your fund is to movements by the rest of
the stock market. A fund with a beta of 1 moves up and down by the
same order of magnitude as the stock market. A beta of 0.75 shows the
fund tends to underperform by 25% when the market gains but declines
25% less when the market falls. If you want less wild swings in your
financial life and can accept lower returns as a result, look for a fund
with a low beta.
 Alpha: Definitely one of the best statistics out there for measuring
mutual funds. This single number tells you whether the portfolio man-
ager is adding value or destroying value. When a fund has a negative
alpha, that means it performs worse than it should, based on the
amount of risk that’s being assumed. When the alpha is positive, it
means the manager is adding value by getting a better return than would
be expected for the risk being taken. Always look for mutual funds with
positive alphas. In measuring alpha, Morningstar compares all funds not
only to the market (S&P 500), but also to the index that most closely
matches a fund’s investment objective.
Getting the Full Story: Reading 
a Mutual Fund’s Prospectus
Mutual fund companies are required by regulators to clearly explain to
investors, in writing, everything an investor would need to know. This infor-
mation is contained in a regulatory filing called the prospectus. These docu-
ments are very detailed and worth reading before you invest in a fund. 
Nearly all the most vital data contained in mutual fund prospectuses are cap-
tured by mutual fund Web sites described in the preceding sections. There’s
no need to dig through a prospectus to get things like fees or investment
objectives. But a section of the prospectus that’s often left out of the Web
sites is the risks section, which outlines all the things that could go wrong.
245
Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds

That’s worth checking out. Also, the SEC provides guidelines on what to look
for in the prospectus at www.sec.gov/answers/mfinfo.htm.
You have several ways to get the prospectus online, including the following: 
 The Mutual fund provider’s Web site: The mutual fund company’s Web
site almost always has a link to the prospectus. 
 Sources for regulatory filings: Mutual fund prospectuses are regulatory
filings, so you can retrieve them from many of the same places you can
get companies’ filings, described in Chapter 2. The Securities and
Exchange Commission’s Web site (www.sec.gov) provides the informa-
tion for free. (Figure 10-3 shows the SEC’s Search page for Mutual Funds
Prospectuses.)

Getting more information about funds
The funny thing about mutual funds is that they can be extremely hands-off
or an addiction. On the one hand, you can buy a target date mutual fund, 
set up an AMI and never think about your mutual fund again. But, you can
also read about the ins and outs of mutual funds and keep up on all the new
developments. If you’re interested in studying funds, there are some sites to
check out, including the following:
 MAXfunds.com: (www.maxfunds.com) Maxfunds features a blog that
constantly presents news developments regarding the mutual fund
world. 
 Brill’s Mutual Funds Interactive: (www.brill.com) Brill’s digs deeply
into timely mutual fund topics such as whether target-date funds would
make sense for you or how to pick mutual funds that hold up well during
economic downturns. 
 John Bogle’s Web site at Vanguard: (www.vanguard.com/bogle_
site/bogle_speeches.html) A collection of Vanguard founder John
Bogle’s speeches, this page is an invaluable source for investing insights
not just for mutual fund investors, but for everyone.
 USATODAY.com: (www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/columnist/
waggon) Home for the Mutual funds guy at USATODAY, John Waggoner,
this page features regular columns in which Waggoner discusses mutual
fund developments as well as strategies to improve your success.
 TheStreet.com: (http://find.thestreet.com/cgi-bin/texis/
tscsection/?k=Mutual%20Funds&sec=Mutual%20Funds&sub
menu=personalfinancemenu&ref=tscnav) It’s a long URL, but it’s
worth all the typing. The Mutual Funds section of TheStreet.com pro-
vides a good selection of stories written about mutual funds.

Finding and Buying Exchange-
Traded Funds
In This Chapter
 Finding out how exchange-traded funds differ from mutual funds
 Locating ETFs that that fit your needs using online tools
 Understanding how ETFs are bought and sold online
 Uncovering ways to research exchange-traded funds
A
relatively new type of fund called an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is
exploding with popularity. Like index ETF mutual funds, ETFs invest in
baskets of stocks tied to a stock market index. But ETFs differ from mutual
funds in that they trade during the day just like an individual stock. This
important difference gives ETFs an edge over mutual funds for some
investors. 
ETFs have lured $422.5 billion of investors’ cash since they started to catch
on in the early 1990s. In this chapter, I explain how online tools can maximize
your success investing in mutual funds and ETFs. I help you use online tools
to pick the right investments for you and show you how to set up an account
to buy or sell the funds. 
Getting to Know the Newcomers: ETFs
Exchange-traded funds have been one of the biggest developments in the
world of finance since banks started giving away free toasters to customers.
ETFs are baskets of stocks, much like mutual funds, that trade like stocks.
You can buy and sell them using your online broker just like you would with
other stocks. All ETFs have trading symbols and qualify for the low commis-
sion rates from online brokers. You can even get price quotes by using your
favorite stock-tracking Web sites, including those listed in Chapter 2.

You can buy and sell ETFs by using the online broker you’ve already signed
up with. Just enter the ETF’s trading symbol, and you can buy and sell just
like you would shares of a company’s stock.
Investors like ETFs because they’re easy to buy without the hassle of signing
up for accounts with mutual fund companies or checking to see whether
they’re transaction-free. Unlike mutual funds, which update their price once a
day after the market closes, ETF prices are constantly updated during the
trading day. That means investors can just buy ETFs and sell them whenever
they want during the day. This explains why the number of ETFs has taken
off, as shown in Table 11-1.

ETFs have the same advantages of mutual funds, as described in Chapter 10.
That includes diversification and access to specific corners of the stock
market, including certain sizes of stocks or industries. ETFs, though, offer
several advantages over mutual funds including the following:
 Intraday trading: Mutual funds price once a day, meaning you don’t
know how your portfolio has done until the markets close and the fund
companies get around to publishing the net asset value (NAV) for the
day. The prices of ETFs constantly update during the day just like
stocks. 
 Access to tougher areas of the market: Investors interested in buying
commodities, bonds, and currencies can buy them easily, just like buying
a stock, thanks to ETFs. And because ETFs are priced during the day,
speculators can get in and out of risky positions anytime they want.
ETFs are a great way to add foreign exposure to your portfolio, as I
explain in the “Broadening Your Horizons: International Stocks” bonus
chapter on the Web site associated with this book.
250
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Low fees: If you thought the fees on index mutual funds were low, ETFs
in many cases are even lower. It’s not unusual for ETFs to charge lower
maintenance fees than mutual funds that mirror the same stock index by
owning all the stocks in the index. The average expense ratio of ETFs is
roughly 0.5%, well below the 1.1% charged by mutual funds.
 Tax advantages: Due to their structure, ETFs rarely stick investors 
with capital-gain distributions. That helps investors plan tax strategies.
Keep in mind, though, many ETFs still pay dividends, which are usually
taxable.
 Offer advanced trading options: Most ETFs offer options, specific trad-
ing vehicles I discuss in Chapter 5. That’s attractive to investors who
want to do more than just buy or sell the investments. ETFs can also be
shorted, a technique used to bet an investment will decline in value that I
also explain in Chapter 5. 
Invest in Popular Indexes with ETFs
So far, most ETFs track a stock market index much like an index mutual fund.
That’s not a bad thing because indexes often outperform actively managed
mutual funds and have lower fees. 
Most of the oldest and largest ETFs, not surprisingly, track the most popular
stock and bond market indexes. Some of the largest ETFs that track widely
followed indexes include those listed in Table 11-2.

How to Find the Right ETF for the Job
As with mutual funds, one of the toughest things about ETFs is just finding
them amid the hundreds of choices out there. But as with mutual funds,
online screeners can help you scour through the universe of ETFs and find
the ones that fit your needs. The following list gives you a representative
sampling:
 ETFConnect: (www.etfconnect.com) This particular site allows you to
search for an ETF by using a keyword or by selecting a type of ETF, such
as those that track bonds and stocks. Searching by keyword is especially
handy if you’re looking to invest in a somewhat offbeat type of stock,
commodity, or part of the world. Want to invest in an ETF that invests in
natural resources stocks, for instance? Just type the words natural
resources in the search field, click the Go button, and you get a list. 
 ETFZone: (www.etfzone.com/data/funds.php) ETFZone provides
an advanced ETF screener that lets you find ETFs based on their size
and style (such as large cap, value, or growth) and also by short-term
and long-term returns.
252
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Morningstar: (http://screen.morningstar.com/ETFScreener/
Selector.html) Yes, Morningstar does ETFs, too. This section of the
site provides a complete screening tool, with detailed search capabilities
that help you quickly find the ETF that passes all your criteria. 
Some investors seek ETFs that track specific industries. Morningstar
makes it easy to find them. From the screener, select the industry you
hope to invest in from the Morningstar Category drop-down list. You can
also search for the industry’s name by using ETFConnect.
 Online brokers: The big players often provide tools that help you find
the right ETFs for you. For instance, TD Ameritrade (https://wwws.
ameritrade.com/cgi-bin/apps/Horizon) offers a site that studies
your investment objectives and suggests ETFs that might help get you
there. 
 ETF providers’ Web sites: The largest ETF providers, Barclays Global
(www.ishares.com), Vanguard (https://flagship.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/funds/etf), and State Street (www.ssgafunds.com)
provide very detailed information about their families of funds. 
Don’t assume these are just worthless promotional sites. They’re well
organized and make it easy to find what you’re looking for. You can find
some interesting features on these sites, including State Street’s Corre-
lation Tracker (www.ssgafunds.com/resources/correlation_
tracker.html), which can tell you which ETFs have a low correlation
with any stock you enter. (Investments are said to have low correlations
with each other when they don’t move in lockstep with one another.)
Buying ETFs with low correlations, as I explain in Chapter 9, is attractive
because it can lower your portfolio’s total risk.
Curious which stocks an ETF owns? All the online resources I mention here
provide ETFs’ top holdings. These are the stocks that have the largest posi-
tions in an ETF. 
Tracking ETFs’ every move
Because ETFs are priced during the day just like stocks, they can be useful
tools to tell you what types of stocks and industries are moving each day.
NASDAQ’s ETF center (http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/investment
products.asp) provides in-depth analysis of the ETFs that went up and
down the most in value each trading session. It also shows you the most 
popular ETFs, ranked by trading activity, or volume. (Volume is a measure of
how many times shares of a stock trade hands.) The ETF Dynamic Heatmap
(http://screening.nasdaq.com/heatmaps/heatmap_ETF.asp) uses 
a color-coded grid to show which ETFs are moving the most. 
253
Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange-Traded Funds

ETF fees can vary
Using screening sites like the ones in the preceding section, you can easily
find and compare the fees charged by ETFs. Here’s how you do it using
ETFConnect, for example:
1. Point your browser to www.etfconnect.com.
2. Enter the symbol or name of the ETF you’re interested in checking
fees for into the Search field in the upper-right corner of the page and
then click the Go button. 
3. Look over the screen. 
254
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
Don’t assume the most popular ETFs are the best
When you buy an ETF, you’re most frequently
buying a basket of stocks mirroring a stock
index. And when shopping for index funds, you
typically want to find the ones that either best
track the type of stocks you’re interested in or
have the lowest fees. 
Ask yourself the same questions you consider
when buying an index mutual fund: 
 How large is the ETF? In the case of an ETF,
the more assets under management, the
better. You don’t want to invest in a small
ETF that doesn’t attract enough investors
and ends up being shut down. This is becom-
ing more of an issue as more ETFs are
rushed to the market. 
To find out how large an ETF is, go to the
Morningstar site (www.morningstar.
com), enter the ticker symbol of the ETF in
the Quotes field, and then press Enter. On
the new page that appears, click the
Snapshot link on the left side of the page
and you’ll find the fund’s total assets. 
 What index does the ETF track? Some
small-cap indexes, for instance, track the
Russell 2000, and others track the Standard
& Poor’s 600. Both track small stocks, but
there are differences between the indexes
themselves. Make sure that you’re tracking
the index you prefer. 
Imagine, if you will, that you want to buy an
ETF that invests in small companies. It’s a
good idea to check the Web site of the ETF
company and check the average market
value of the stocks held by the ETF and
compare it with the competition. 
 What are the expenses? If everything else
is equal, there’s nothing wrong with looking
at the price tag and going with the ETF that’s
cheapest. Vanguard, a low-cost leader in
mutual funds, has emerged as a low-cost
leader in ETFs as well. Vanguard almost
always deserves serious consideration for
that reason. The rampant competition in the
ETF business has dramatically driven down
fees. That’s why it’s worthwhile to use one
of the screening tools mentioned in this
chapter to see what fee the fund charges
and compare it to other options. 

The screen shows all the vitals about the ETF, including its price, the
fund company that sponsors it, when it was created, what it invests in,
and what its top holdings are. You also see the breakdown of industries
it owns and what countries the stocks are based in. 
4. Scroll down until you see the ETF Facts box.
You need to scroll down quite a ways — the box is on the right side. The
ETF Facts box shows you several things, including the ETF’s expense
ratio. 
The expense ratio is a very important number that tells you the annual
fee the ETF provider will charge you for owning the ETF. If you invest
$1,000 in an ETF with an expense ratio of 0.5%, that means you’ll pay an
annual fee of $5. You want to compare this ratio with other ETFs you
might be considering. You can see a sample in Figure 11-1.
Finding out how pricey an ETF is
Stock investors commonly look at the price-to-earnings ratio, or P-E, of an indi-
vidual stock to find out how expensive it is. The higher the P-E, the more
richly valued the stock is, as I explain in detail in Chapter 13. But ETF
investors can also use P-E ratios to find how cheap or expensive the stocks
held by the ETF are. 
Figure 11-1:
You can find
all sorts of
particulars
about 
ETFs at
ETFConnect,
including
the all-
important
expense
ratio. 
255
Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange-Traded Funds

Several Web sites provide P-E ratios for ETFs. Using Yahoo! Finance (finance.
yahoo.com) , enter the ETF’s symbol into the search field at the upper left
area of the page. Click the Get Quotes button. You see the ETF’s P-E listed on
the right-hand side of the quote box, next to the label P/E (ttm), which stands
for price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing (or last) 12 months. 
Yahoo! Finance also provides risk and performance measures for ETFs. The
risk measures, such as standard deviation, help you determine how much the
ETF will give you indigestion by swinging up and down in value. (These risk
measures are explained in detail in Chapter 1.) The performance measures
tell you how well the ETF has done. After entering an ETF’s symbol, just click
the Performance and Risk links on the left side with the blue background. 
To get the P-E ratio of an ETF from Morningstar (www.morningstar.com),
enter the symbol of the ETF you’re interested in and click the Go button. In
the new page that appears, click the Portfolio link on the left side. There you
can find the ETF’s P-E ratio and how it compares with the Standard & Poor’s
500 index. You can also find lots of other details on the Portfolio page, such
as other valuation ratios and which industry sectors the ETF’s holdings 
fall into. 
ETFs That Go off the Beaten Path
Most ETFs are pretty typical and closely track their designated indexes. But
ETFs are so new and relatively easy to create that some companies, including
the following, have experimented with some interesting concepts: 
 WisdomTree (www.wisdomtree.com) lets investors bet on academic
research from Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel. Rather than following
the lead of most ETFs and index mutual funds, which hold bigger chunks
of stocks that have the greatest market values, Siegel suggests that it’s
better to own bigger chunks of companies that pay large dividends.
There’s an entire set of WisdomTree funds, enough to satisfy any asset
allocation, based on this theory.
 Rydex Investments (www.rydexfunds.com) offers some offbeat ETFs,
including the Rydex S&P Equal Weight (symbol RSP) which holds equal
chunks of all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index. 
 PowerShares (www.powershares.com) provides ETFs that track just
about any industry you can imagine, ranging from biotech to companies
working on nanotechnology as well as specialized portfolios that include
companies that pay large dividends or buy back their stock.
 ProShares (www.proshares.com) is attempting to make advanced
trading strategies more accessible. For instance, its Short QQQ ETF
(PSQ) goes up when the NASDAQ 100 goes down, giving investors a way
to bet against technology stocks. Similar funds let investors bet against
other indexes like the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones industrial average. 
256
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

ETFs Have Issues, Too
ETFs are great for many investors looking for ways to keep their costs down
and simplify their lives. After all, you can buy all your stock and ETF invest-
ments from the same brokerage account. But ETFs have drawbacks, too, as
the following list makes clear:
 Commissions: Unlike mutual funds, which can often be bought with no
commissions through online brokers or directly from fund companies,
ETFs are treated like stocks. That means your online broker’s standard
stock commission applies. That can be a deal-killer if you make frequent
and small investments. Unless you use an online broker with free trades,
such as those discussed in Chapter 4, you might be better off with an
index mutual fund.
 Temptation: The ability to trade in and out of ETFs is too irresistible for
some investors — the kind who can’t keep their fingers off their mouse
buttons. If the constant pricing of ETFs encourages you to trade too
much and veer off your asset allocation course, you might be better off
with mutual funds.
 Invisible cost: the spread: ETFs come with an invisible, but costly fee.
Just as with stocks, ETFs have a bid and an ask price. The bid is the
price other investors are willing to pay for the ETF, and the ask is the
price the seller will take. The difference, called the spread, costs
investors money. 
For example, say you bought 100 shares of an ETF at the ask price of
$100. Most likely, you’d only be able to sell it for $99.90 or less, costing
you in effect 10 cents a share. The less popular an ETF, the wider the
spread becomes, and the greater this cost becomes. Are you curious
about what an ETF’s bid and ask prices are? They’re available from the
same places you get stock quotes.
 Premiums and discounts: ETFs are priced based on what buyers and
sellers are willing to pay for the basket of stocks they own. That means
it’s possible the price of an ETF might be greater or less than the value
of the stocks it owns. When the ETF price is greater than the value of the
stocks it owns, that situation is a premium, and when the opposite is
true and the ETF is worth less than the value of its stocks, the ETF is
said to be trading at a discount. You can look up the size of the premium
or discount for an ETF at www.etfconnect.com. 
Don’t get overly concerned with the premium or discount. Most ETFs’
premium or discount is rather small. And for popular ETFs, it’s practi-
cally nonexistent. 
257
Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange-Traded Funds

A Few Final Things to 
Consider About ETFs
One of the reasons ETFs have been so popular is that they make it easy to
invest in assets that were difficult to invest in before. By buying a single ETF
just as you’d buy a stock, you can instantly invest in a basket of companies
working on alternative energy or in financial commodities like gold. Since
ETFs have made it much easier to invest in a wide array of investments, it’s
more important than ever for investors to know how to find out exactly what
they’re buying when they purchase an ETF by reading the prospectus. This
section will show you how. 
Using ETFs as a way to invest in themes
Investors might periodically want to get a stake on a trend they feel will be
important in the future. Some investors, for instance, feel global warming is a
serious issue and want to invest in stocks that are finding new sources of
energy that generate less pollution. Other investors can’t bear to invest in
companies they feel contribute to social ills, so they focus on socially respon-
sible ETFs. ETFs are perfect for this kind of thing because you can invest in
an index that tracks a basket of stocks involved in the theme you’re inter-
ested in. You can invest in the trend by just buying one investment and
spread your risk over several companies. 
ETFs that invest in specialty areas of interest generally charge higher expense
ratios and may not generate large returns to warrant the costs. Before invest-
ing in an investing theme, make sure you’re not getting caught up in a fad.
Also, make sure you’re not spending money on management fees that could
have been better spent just donating directly to charity. 
A few examples of specialty ETFs include those listed in Table 11-3.

Investors who buy an ETF that tracks a theme might feel they’ve reduced
their risk by owning many companies, not just one. There’s a bit of truth to
that because you’re spreading your risk over many different companies. But
don’t make the mistake of thinking that owning an ETF alone saves you from
risk. You’re still at risk if the trend falls apart.
Betting on commodities and 
currencies with ETFs
Buying commodities like oil, gold, and steel, even today, isn’t as convenient
as you’d think. You usually need to establish a special account with a broker
that specializes in commodity trading if you want to invest in commodities
directly. Buying and selling currencies can be a hassle, too. That’s why ETFs
are a boon for stock investors who would like to add some commodities and
currencies to their portfolios. 
Most of the major commodities and many currencies can be invested in
through ETFs. Table 11-4 shows examples for many of the major commodities.

Just because you can invest in commodities doesn’t mean you should. Gold,
for instance, has been a poor long-term performer that has generated subpar
returns and greater risk. Be sure you understand the risks of commodities
before jumping in. 
Reading the fine print: The prospectus
Like mutual funds, ETFs must be fully described to investors in a prospectus.
These documents describe ETFs’ structures, investing objective, fees, and all
other details to investors — and are filled with legal jumble. But they’re
worth taking a look at if you’re going to invest in an ETF. 
There are several main ways to get the prospectus online, including from the
following sources:
 The ETF provider’s Web site: If you log in to the Web site of the com-
pany that provides the investment, you can almost always find a link to
the prospectus. This is typically the easiest way to find a prospectus. 
For example, say you’re interested in investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.
Log in to State Street’s Web site (www.ssgafunds.com), enter the ticker
symbol of SPY into the Enter Ticker field, and click the Go button. On
the new page that appears, you see a View Prospectus link on the right
side. Click it to check out the prospectus.
260
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 

 Sources for regulatory filings: ETF prospectuses are regulatory filings,
so you can retrieve them from many of the same places you’d use to get
companies’ filings, as described in Chapter 2. Due to the structure of
ETFs, though, it’s easier to download prospectuses directly from the ETF
provider. Many ETF families, such as iShares, make it easy to click a link
and download the prospectus. Figure 11-2 shows the Prospectus link at
iShares.com. (You see the link on the left side.)

f you’re the kind of online investor looking to buy the next Google, this
chapter offers tips that might help you. I show you how to use online tools
to unearth details about companies that aren’t picked up by general investing
Web sites explained in Chapters 2 and 6. I explain how you can glean insights
about companies by picking apart financial statements, and I show you how to
compare companies with their peers. 
Just be careful. Consistently picking winning stocks and buying and selling
them at the right times is infamously difficult and time consuming. If you
don’t know what you’re doing, you might make less money picking individual
stocks over the long term than you would if you just bought a mutual fund or
exchange-traded fund that keeps up with the market.
Understanding Financial Statements
Most investors focus on companies’ quarterly earnings reports. It’s under-
standable. Stocks rapidly respond to whether a company topped, matched,
or missed earnings expectations for the quarter. Online tools, described in
Chapter 6, also make it easy to instantly see how a company did during the
quarter and decide whether that changes your opinion on a stock. When

companies report earnings, though, they provide only the most basic and
top-level information in a press release. 
Short-term performance can cause stocks to swing momentarily, but long-
term investors know a company’s true value is based on how it performs over
the years, not just the most recent quarter. Examining a company’s long-term
performance requires a bit more effort and calls for digging into a company’s
financial statements. Investors that study a company’s financial statements
are said to analyze the fundamentals.
Financial statements are detailed documents that show you all the important
numbers from a company, ranging from how profitable it is to how financially
secure it is. Most of the detailed financial statements are available online a
few weeks after the company puts out its earnings press release. The finan-
cial statements must be contained in documents required by regulators,
including
 The 10-Q: The official quarterly report that must be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the main regulator for
stocks. It gives an update for the just-completed three-month period.
The report is due 40 days after the end of the quarter for companies that
have market values of $700 million or more. 
 The 10-K: The official version of a company’s annual report required by
the SEC. After the end of a company’s fiscal year, the company must pro-
vide an annual report called a 10-K. The 10-K, for most companies, is due
75 days after the end of the fiscal year according to the SEC (www.sec.
gov/answers/form10q.htm).
The 10-Q and 10-K statements are vital because they contain these three key
financial statements: 
 The income statement measures the company’s bottom line. It tells you
how much the company earned during the quarter or year based on
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. (GAAP provides the
rules all companies and their accountants must follow so investors
know how to read the numbers.) This statement is also provided in the
earnings press release, but with less detail. 
 The balance sheet tabulates the company’s net worth. The statement
shows you what a company owns and owes at the end of the period. Do
you want to know how much cash the company has in the bank or how
much debt it has? Both numbers are in the balance sheet. The balance
sheet might also be provided with the earnings press release, but with
less detail. 
266
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

 The cash flow statement tells you how much cash came into and went
out of the company during the period. The report, often called the cash
flow statement, is considered one of the most important documents pro-
vided by companies. The cash flow statement is typically not included in
a company’s earnings press release, but it’s worth waiting for in the 10-Q
and 10-K. A company’s cash flow is more difficult to manipulate using
accounting tricks because it’s based on the amount of cold hard cash
that comes into the company.
You can spend a great deal of time mastering the complexities of reading
companies’ regulatory filings and financial statements. If that interests you,
Merrill Lynch (www.merrilllynch.com/media/14069.pdf) offers an
excellent primer for financial statements, which you can download and print.
It goes into great detail and is good resource for investors who want to know
more. The SEC (www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/begfinstmtguide.htm)
has a helpful article on financial statements. And IBM (www.ibm.com/
investor/tools/resourcesPrint.phtml) provides a list of books and
other resources that you can read to become more of an expert. I’ve also
written an interactive online guide (www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/
basics/2003-08-22-10q-intro_x.htm) that steps you through how to
read a company’s 10-Q, including the financial statements. 
Downloading financial statements
Investors can get their hands on financial statements almost instantly.
Numerous sites, listed in Chapter 2, let you download regulatory filings for
free. The SEC (http://sec.gov/investor/pubs/edgarguide.htm) also
provides a users manual online to show you how to download regulatory fil-
ings. When you download a regulatory filing, you might be shocked at how it
looks. They’re typically seas of text and no pictures — they certainly aren’t
the colorful magazine-like document you recall when you think of an annual
report. 
The annual report is a different document. The annual report contains all the
required financial statements and information contained in the 10-Ks, but
they’re contained in a colorful format. If you’ve read the 10-K, you probably
don’t need the annual report. But, annual reports might provide additional,
mostly promotional information about the company, such as photos of new
products or happy customers, and they can be fun to look at depending on
what the company does. You can order these paper documents from the
investor relations section of most companies’ Web sites or download an 
electronic copy. Many of these annual reports are also available from serv-
ices like AnnualReports.com (www.annualreports.com), Annual Report
267
Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope

Resource Center (www.irin.com), and The Public Register’s Annual Report
Service (www.prars.com). Keep in mind, though, that annual reports from
these services are often provided in Adobe’s Acrobat format. The Acrobat
format preserves the photos of the annual reports but is harder to download
into a spreadsheet to analyze. 
The SEC’s Interactive Financial Report Viewer (http://216.241.101.197/
viewer) represents one of the newest and best ways to download financial
statements. This free viewer, shown in Figure 12-1, allows you to download
and easily analyze statements from the hundreds of companies that are filing
their financial results using the increasingly popular eXtensible Business
Reporting Language, or XBRL. Using the viewer you can easily download
many companies’ financial information into a spreadsheet. The SEC (www.
sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl.htm) is encouraging other companies to file
using XBRL.

How to read the income statement
How much money did the company make? That common question is
answered, in detail, by the income statement. The income statement begins
with revenue, which is a measurement of the value of the goods and services
sold by the company. The company’s expenses are then subtracted from rev-
enue to arrive at the company’s profit. Making things a bit more complicated,
though, is that profit can mean one of several things:
 Operating profit, which measures how much the company makes after
paying day-to-day costs, such as buying raw materials that go into the
product as well as paying salaries. Operating profit is closely watched by
Wall Street analysts because it shows how much the company earns
from its business and excludes distortion from one-time charges and
gains. 
 Net income, also known as “the bottom line.” It shows you how much
the company made after subtracting all its costs. If the company lost
money, it’s said to have a net loss. 
 Diluted earnings per share, which is what most investors should pay
attention to. Diluted earnings per share converts a company’s net
income or net loss into a number that’s more relevant to them: The
investor’s share of the profit. Diluted EPS is the earnings number most
professional investors watch. Diluted EPS is measured by dividing
adjusted net income by the number of shares outstanding — that’s to say
the number of shares currently in shareholders’ hands added to the
number that could be in shareholders’ hands if stock options were 
exercised.
 Basic earnings per share, arrived at by simply dividing a company’s net
income by shares outstanding. It doesn’t factor in the cost of dilution. 
 Proforma earnings per share, a controversial way to measure earnings
that was originally designed to help investors. Proforma earnings allow
companies to leave out certain expenses to help investors understand
how the company did excluding the effect of a big event, like a merger.
Some companies, though, abused proforma earnings. These companies
twisted proforma earnings in a way to leave out costs that made their
results look better than they actually were. Proforma earnings drew
such ire from regulators that companies are now required to detail step-
by-step in their earnings press release what charges were left out of the
proforma earnings calculation. 
The first company accused by regulators for abusing proforma earnings
was Trump Hotels (http://sec.gov/news/headlines/trump
hotels.htm). You can read more about this accounting trick, and
others that companies play, in a summary I wrote back in 2002 (www.
usatoday.com/money/energy/enron/2002-02-11-tricks-trade.
htm).

Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope

Basics about the balance sheet
The balance sheet tells you what a company owns and what it owes. The
company separates what it owns, called its assets, from what it owes, its lia-
bilities. The difference between assets and liabilities is what portion of the
company shareholders’ own, called shareholders’ equity. The following list
breaks it all down for you piece by piece:
 Assets are objects of value the company owns, including property,
equipment, and machinery. Assets you can’t see or touch like patents
and trademarks, called intangible assets, are also included. Assets are
further classified as 
• Current assets: Stuff that will be turned into cold hard cash within a
year.
• Non-current assets: Stuff like trucks and physical equipment that
isn’t expected to be turned into cash within a year.
 Liabilities are the company’s obligations. Liabilities include such things
as bank loans, IOUs given to suppliers, taxes owed, or promises to
deliver products to customers in the future.
270
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
The stock buyback blues
You’ll want to monitor a company’s number of
shares outstanding after it says it’s buying back
stock. Sometimes companies use excess cash
to buy their own shares. Investors often applaud
stock buybacks because they can, in theory,
reduce the number of shares outstanding. And
that means each shareholder’s slice of the pie
gets bigger. 
Sounds like a great idea, right? But stock 
buybacks aren’t always what they’re cracked
up to be. Keep the following in mind when you
hear that a company has announced a stock
buyback: 
 Stock buybacks can distort earnings per
share. If you see a company’s earnings per
share rise, don’t assume that’s because the
company is more profitable. If a company
buys back stock, earnings per share can
rise even if net income is flat. 
 There’s no rule that says the company must
follow-through. Just because a company
announces it’s buying back stock, that
doesn’t mean it will. In fact, some academic
research has found many companies 
that announced stock buybacks actually
increased their shares outstanding as they
issued additional shares to give to employ-
ees and executives. You can find out more
about buybacks at The Buyback Letter
(www.buybackletter.com). 

• Current liabilities: Bills and other obligations due within a year. The
current portion of long-term debt, for instance, is the chunk the
company must pay off within a year. 
• Non-current liabilities: Long-term obligations the company doesn’t
have to pay back within a year. 
 Shareholders’ equity measures the value of the investors’ ownership of
the company. It’s kind of the corporate version of your net worth. Your
net worth is the value of your assets minus your debt. Shareholders’
equity is the same: It’s equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities. 
One of the best things to pay attention to in the balance sheet is the com-
pany’s number of shares outstanding, which is the number of shares that are in
the hands of investors. A company’s number of shares outstanding is very
important because it measures how many pieces the company’s profits is
sliced into and how big a piece each shareholder gets. 
What you need to know about 
the cash flow statement
Don’t make the mistake of ignoring the cash flow statement. This statement
cuts through all the smoke and mirrors of accounting to show you how much
cold hard cash came into or went out of a company. The statement is divided
into the following three parts:
 Cash from operating activities tells you how much cash the company
used or generated from its normal course of business. This portion of
the cash flow statement adjusts net income by adding back expenses
that didn’t cost the company cash, most importantly an expense called
depreciation that accounts for the cost of wear and tear on equipment.
 Cash from investing activities shows how much cash a company uses
to invest in new property and equipment, also known as capital expendi-
tures or Cap Ex. The section also shows how much cash the company
generates selling assets.
 Cash from financing activities illustrates how much cash a company
brings onto its balance sheet, mostly by selling bonds.
Putting it all together
Some of the real power of financial statements occurs when you take ele-
ments of one statement and compare it with numbers on other statements.
271
Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope

The first thing many investment professionals do when they get an annual
report, for instance, is compare the cash flow statement with the income
statement. If a company is reporting banner profits on the income statement
but not bringing in as much cash, that’s a potential red flag. Low cash flow
can be a sign the company has low quality of earnings. A company has low
quality of earnings when it shows large profits on its financial statements due
to accounting gimmicks, not because it’s selling lots of goods and services to
actual customers.
Here’s an easy way for you to analyze a company’s cash flow: Just compare a
company’s free cash flow with its net income.
You can get the data by doing the following:
 Analyzing the financial statements yourself: A company’s free cash
flow measures how much cash it brings in the door after paying
expenses to keep itself going. Free cash flow (FCF) is a cousin to cash
from operating activities. FCF, however, is stricter than cash from operat-
ing activities in that it accounts for the fact companies use cash to buy
new equipment and facilities. To calculate free cash flow, enter the
stock’s ticker symbol into one of the Get Up to Ten Quotes text fields on
NASDAQ’s home page (www.nasdaq.com) and the click the Info Quotes
button. In the new page that appears, choose Company Financials from
the InfoQuotes drop-down list at the top of the page. (The Company
Financials option is about halfway down the menu.) In the new page that
appears, click the Statements of Cash Flow link at the top of the page,
which brings you to a page similar to what you see in Figure 12-2. To 
get the company’s free cash flow, subtract the number in the Capital
Expenditures row from number the Net Cash Flow-Operating row.
Compare that difference with the number in the Net Income row. 
 Getting the data from a Web site: Several sites, including Forbes (www.
forbes.com), provide free cash flow data. On the Forbes site, scroll
down to find the Quotes/Research box on the right side with a text field
for entering a stock symbol. Enter the stock’s symbol (GE, for instance)
in the Quotes/Research box and click the Go button. On the new page
that appears, scroll down quite a ways and then click the More GE Ratios
& Returns link that appears right beneath a Ratios & Returns table. You
can find the company’s Free Cash Flow per Share listed in the new page
that appears, under the Latest 12 Months Data Item section.
Multiply the company’s Free Cash Flow per Share figure you get from
Forbes by the company’s number of shares outstanding to get the com-
pany’s total free cash flow. You can get a company’s number of shares
outstanding from almost any financial Web site discussed in Chapter 2.
You can get shares outstanding from Forbes.com by clicking on the At A
Glance link on the left side of the page under Quotes & Chart.

You have a company’s free cash flow and net income. Now what? Table 12-1

sional investors do.

How to spot trends in financial statements
When you’re studying the financial statements, you should either look for
patterns or look for things that don’t fit the company’s usual trend. The fol-
lowing sections highlight a few of the things you’ll want to pay attention to.
A company’s growth rate
When you get a raise from your boss, what’s the first thing you want to know?
How much of a percentage increase it is from your previous year’s salary. The
same goes for every item on a company’s income statement and balance
sheet. You could go through every item on the financial statements and calcu-
late the change from last year by hand, but Reuters, shown in Figure 12-3, will
do it for you. Here’s how:
1. Point your browser to www.reuters.com/investing?WTmodLOC=

enter the stock’s ticker symbol into the Enter Symbol field.
3. Select the Ratios radio button option below the Enter Symbol field
and then click Go.
You see the Ratios page for the company whose ticker symbol you
entered.

How free cash flow saved investors from Enron
Investors who compared Enron’s free cash flow
with net income were glad they did. Enron’s
quarterly statement from the first quarter of 2001
before its collapse (http://sec.gov/
Archives/edgar/data/1024401/000
102440101500014/ene10-q.txt) is
very telling. During the quarter, Enron wowed
investors with net income of $425 million. But
investors who took the time to study the quar-
terly report saw the company burned $464 mil-
lion in cash from operations and another $382
million in capital expenditures. That means
Enron effectively burned up $846 million in cash,
even while telling investors how profitable the
company was.

4. On the Ratios page, scroll down to the Growth Rates section.
Here you can find the growth rates of sales and earnings per share (EPS)
in the most recent quarter, called MRQ. Reuters also shows you the com-
pany’s earnings growth rate in the trailing 12 months, called TTM. Lastly,
you can view longer-term growth rates in earnings and capital expendi-
tures over the past five years.
If you’d like to see a breakdown of quarterly growth, MSN Money (http://
moneycentral.msn.com/investor) provides an easy summary screen.
First, enter the stock’s ticker symbol into the Symbols field and click Go. On
the new page that appears, click the Financial Results link from the list on the
left. In the Financial: Highlights page that appears, scroll down and find the
quarter-by-quarter breakdown of the company’s growth.
A company’s financial composition
Many professional investors compare each item on the income statement
with revenue and each item on the balance sheet with total assets. This lets
you find interesting trends, such as whether the company is increasing its
spending on research and development or the company’s debt is rising. You
just need to divide each item on the income statement by revenue and each
item on the balance sheet by total assets to perform this analysis, called

common sizing. Investopedia teaches you how to common size a balance
sheet (www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonsizebalancesheet.
asp) and an income statement (www.investopedia.com/terms/c/
commonsizeincomestatement.asp). NetMBA (www.netmba.com/
finance/statements/common-size) also explains why common 
sizing financial statements is a good idea.
Using financial statements 
to understand the company
Financial statements can help you understand the structure and objective of
a company. Consider the following aspects of the company:
 Value: Some investors try to figure out how much a company is worth
by using its financial statements. If the company is worth more than the
stock price would suggest, that tells these value investors the stock
might be undervalued. One way investors determine how much a com-
pany is worth is by examining book value. Book value is a complex
accounting principle. Just know that book value generally measures the
value of the company’s tangible assets recorded in the financial state-
ments minus liabilities. If the company’s market value is less than the
book value, some investors see it as being undervalued. The market
value, the stock price times the number of shares outstanding, tells you
how much the company is worth in investors’ eyes. I show you how to
use the price-to-book ratio to determine whether a stock is undervalued
or overvalued in Chapter 12.
 Growth prospects: Some investors look for companies posting gigantic
earnings or revenue growth, hoping to dig up the next market leaders.
Growth companies generally don’t pay large dividends and prefer to keep
any extra cash to invest in new products. Rapidly rising revenue and
earnings are signs that a company has morphed into a growth company.
 Link to broader economic cycles: Some companies’ earnings and rev-
enue rise and fall along with swings in the broader economy. These com-
panies are called cyclical companies because they follow economic
cycles. Typically industrial companies like steelmakers belong to this
category.
 Protection from economic cycles: Companies that don’t follow the
economy’s ups and down are often called defensive companies. These
include companies, such as utilities and grocery stores, that tend to sell
the same amount of goods no matter what the economy is doing.
 Stability and sustainability: Some companies generate steadily increas-
ing revenue and earnings because they rely on several products with
stable demand. Many large companies belong to this category. But 
276
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

companies involved in finding breakthroughs, such as biotech compa-
nies researching cures and oil companies looking for untapped reserves,
have big ups and downs in their earnings based on their luck. Companies
with volatile earnings are called speculative companies.
 Debt load: The balance sheet shows you how much money the company
is borrowing. You can compare a company’s debt load with its share-
holders’ equity to see how heavy the debt load is. I show you how to use
computer screening tools to find companies with low debt levels in
Chapter 13.
Unearthing Details About the Company
from Regulatory Filings
Many of the things you need to know about companies, contained in quar-
terly and annual reports, are pulled out for you by the financial Web sites I
describe in Chapters 2 and 6. Nearly all the vital company information you
need is easily obtained that way, including the following:
 Company descriptions, or profiles, telling you what the company does
 Major owners of the stock, including large mutual funds and pension
funds
 Names of the officers and directors, their ages, and their experience
 Dividends paid by the company
 Number of employees
But as helpful as the financial Web sites are, they’re missing a great deal of
textual information contained in companies’ annual reports. That means it’s
up to you to read the company’s regulatory filings to get the full picture. You
can glean some interesting details about the company if you take the time.
Finding the nitty-gritty description 
of the company
Most 10-K filings contain a company overview section. This overview goes
into exhaustive detail about the company’s business, well beyond the quick
snapshot descriptions offered on financial Web sites. For instance, a com-
pany will outline what countries it has facilities and employees located in.
The company might also break out what parts of its business is largest.
277
Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope

If you’re investing in a large diversified company like General Electric, which
is involved in many businesses, you can get a grasp of the company’s entire
empire from the company overview in the 10-K. The company overview
might also show you what parts of its business are the largest and most 
profitable.
Getting the details on company 
announcements
When a company has an important event — referred to by investment pros
as a material event — the company is required to tell shareholders about it.
Companies might inform shareholders by issuing a press release, which you
can find out how to access online in Chapter 2. But it must also provide
details of the announcement to regulators in the form of a Form 8-K. The SEC
(http://sec.gov/answers/form8k.htm) explains all the corporate
events that require companies to file 8-Ks.
Finding out whether the 
company is being sued
When companies put out glowing press releases about their new products or
services, they rarely bring up news about the lawsuits they might be facing.
Although most lawsuits end up amounting to nothing, they’re something you
want to be aware of. Nearly all companies’ 10-Ks contain a Legal Proceedings
section that lists pending lawsuits and says how serious the company thinks
they are. 
278

My one Julia Roberts reference
Remember the movie Erin Brockovich? It was
based on the famous lawsuit brought by
Brockovich over alleged injuries that resulted
from chromium exposure near Pacific Gas &
Electric’s Hinkley Compressor Station in San
Bernardino County. The allegations were
described in detail in the company’s 1994 10-K
(http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/
data/75488/0000950149-94-000070.
txt). In the filing, the company also disclosed
various environmental protection measures that
would cost it $55 million over five years. (And,
yes, Julia Roberts won the Best Actress
Academy Award for 2001 for her role as Erin
Brockovich.)

Regulatory filings are typically giant seas of text. When perusing a filing
online, you can quickly skip to different areas by holding down the Ctrl key
and pressing the F key. You can then enter a search term, such as “legal pro-
ceedings,” and jump right to that section in the filing.
You can also check online whether a company is being sued as part of a 
securities class action lawsuit, where investors alleged they were defrauded.
The Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse (http://
securities.stanford.edu) is an excellent resource to see whether a
company you’re invested in is a party of one of these suits.
Getting the truth from management
CEOs and top management must include in their company 10-Ks a section
called Management’s Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A. This is where the
company must tell regulators how the year went and give their honest
assessment of how the business is performing.
Many professional investors read the MD&A section from the prior year
before reading the one from the just-completed year and compare the two.
It’s telling to see what forecasts management made in the previous year and
then find out whether they came true.
BusinessWeek (www.businessweek.com) makes it easy to compare last
year’s 10-K with this year’s. Just enter the company’s ticker symbol in the
Stock Quotes field in the center of the page and then click Go. On the new
page that appears, click the Financials tab and then click the tab’s SEC Filings
link. The site provides links to all the company’s quarterly and annual filings
for the past four years.
Seeing whether the company has gotten
into a tiff with its auditors
Companies must hire accounting firms to look over, or audit, their annual
financial statements. Typically, the accounting firms study the company’s
results and sign off with a Good Housekeeping seal of approval. But periodi-
cally, the auditors find a problem, and that’s something you want to know
about as an investor.
You can find out about accounting problems by opening a company’s annual
report and searching for the word restatement. A restatement usually outlines
279
Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope

any problems the company or its auditor has found with the accounting.
Restatements can be a real shock to investors because they mean companies
might not have earned as much money as they previously said they did.
When a company finds problems with its financial statements, it’s given a
warning by the stock market exchange to fix the problems. During the time
the company tries to fix its accounting, it’s said to be delinquent in its filings.
This can be a dangerous time to invest in a company’s stock because it’s
unknown what the company’s actual results will end up being. The easiest
way to find out whether a company is delinquent is by going to Yahoo!
Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com), entering the stock symbol into 
the ticker symbol field, and clicking Get Quotes. If the company is delinquent,
you can see a warning on the top of the quote page stating that fact.
Weighing the risk of failure
One of the biggest reasons to bother with reading financial statements is to
look for red flags or warnings of trouble at the company. One of the easiest
signs of trouble you might find, albeit late, is when auditors warn that they
question whether the company can continue as a “going concern.” If you see
these words in a company filing, take notice.
Seeing what the company is worried about
Companies must include a Risks section in their annual reports. These sec-
tions are stuffed with blanket statements about all the bad things that could
happen. Sometimes the company will point out a risk it faces that you might
not have thought of. Just search for the word risks.
Assessing how much the company’s 
management is getting paid
When you’re searching through the company filings, don’t overlook the
boring sounding DEF 14A. These reports, more commonly called proxy state-
ments, are about the juiciest reading you can get about a company. These
statements are among the most frank documents released by a company
because they disclose how much the company executives get paid. You can
download them by using the same steps used to download other regulatory
filings, but the SEC (http://sec.gov/answers/proxyhtf.htm) explains
specifically how to download company proxy statements.
280
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

Search the proxy for the compensation table. Typically, you see each top
executive’s pay broken down into the following categories:
 Salary
 Bonus
 Stock awards
 Stock option awards
 Pension value
 All other compensation
 Total compensation
The proxy statement also contains details about what other perks executives
receive, such as paid-for apartments and personal use of the corporate jet.
How do you know whether the company executives are being overpaid? A
few Web sites help you analyze executives’ pay packages, including the 
following:
 AFL-CIO: (www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/paywatch) Big Labor
has a stake in what Fat Cat executives make, so it shouldn’t come as a
surprise if the AFL-CIO provides a free Executive Paywatch, which shows
you how much executives were paid and how they rank. Just enter the
stock symbol into the Ticker Symbol field and click Go.
 Salary.com: (http://swz.salary.com/execcomp/layoutscripts/
excl_companysearch.asp) This site offers a free salary wizard that
breaks down how much all the top dogs at publicly traded companies
earn.
 CompanyPay: (www.companypay.com) This site ranks the pay pack-
ages of all the largest companies.
 BusinessWeek: (www.businessweek.com) The online version of the
weekly magazine provides executive pay data for industries. Just enter
the company’s ticker symbol into the Stock Quotes field and then click
the People tab on the new page that appears. When the People tab dis-
plays, scroll down a bit to see how the company’s executive pay ranks
on the right side of the screen (compared with the industry as whole).
Determining how independent 
the company’s leadership is
A company’s board of directors is supposed to be the shareholders’ cham-
pion in the board room. All pay packages and strategic decisions must be
281
Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope

approved by the board, so you want to make sure the board represents the
best interests of the shareholders.
The proxy statement is an excellent source of information about the 
company’s officers and board members. There’s almost always a Related
Party Transactions section where the company must disclose any insider
dealings between the company’s officers, directors, and the company itself.
For instance, if a board member’s firm has a business relationship with the
company, you’d want to know because it could skew the board member’s
judgment. With the proxy statement loaded on your screen, just search for
the terms “related party transactions.”
You might also want to know how cozy members of the executive team are
with other executives. BusinessWeek makes that a snap to figure out. Just
enter the company’s ticker symbol into the Stock Quotes text field and then
click the People tab on the new page that appears. You can see whether the
officers and directors have professional relationships with other company
executives, either by sitting on other company boards or being part of the
same organizations.

 Valuing a stock using a discounted cash flow analysis
 Determining the valuation of a stock, including price-to-earnings ratios
 Using online stock selection tools to study investments
 Comparing a company to its peers and industry
W
hen investors say they bought a stock because “it’s a good company,”
you should automatically become skeptical. As you find out in this
chapter, one of the biggest mistakes investors make is confusing a company
and its stock. They’re not the same thing. 
A company’s success is measured by its revenue and earnings growth, things
that are discussed in Chapter 11. But a stock is a different animal. Stock
prices are determined by how much investors are willing to pay. If too many
people think a company is good, they might pay top dollar for the stock and
drive up its valuation. And when a valuation rises, your potential return
decreases. Valuations are the root of one of the most perverse realities in
investing: Good companies can be bad stocks. If you overpay for a stock,
even if the company delivers great earnings growth, you can still lose money.
Savvy investors know the price they pay for a stock is one of the biggest fac-
tors that determines how much they’ll profit.
This chapter shows you how to find good stocks with reasonable valuations.
Although measuring valuations can get math heavy, I spare your calculator
by showing you online tools that will do much of the work for you. You also
discover the ins and outs of the price-to-earnings ratio, one of the most com-
monly used — and misunderstood — ways to measure a stock’s valuation. I
show you stock tools that step you through the process of picking stocks and
ways to compare a company’s valuation with its peers. 

Finding Out How to Not 
Overpay for Stocks
Even if you find a great company with a top-notch management team and
popular products, it doesn’t mean you should buy the stock. Why not? The
sad truth is you’re probably not the first or only person to know about the
company’s bright future. And if other investors bought the stock already,
they likely have pushed the stock price higher. When a stock price has
already risen in anticipation of good news, the good news has been priced in.
That could mean that, even if the good news you’re expecting pans out, the
stock price might not budge because it already had nosed up previously in
anticipation of the good news.
The difficulty of evaluating a stock’s valuation is one reason why investing in
individual stocks is more complex than buying and holding index mutual
funds and exchange-traded funds. Before I show you how to measure a stock’s
valuation, I run through the things you should ask yourself before you decide
to buy a stock: 
 Does the stock fit into your asset allocation? If your portfolio is already
stuffed with small companies, you might not want to add another small
company. Instead, you’ll want to invest in different types of companies
that better fit your asset allocation plan. (I talk about asset allocation
plans in Chapter 9.) 
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) provides an easy way to find out
where a stock would fit in your asset allocation plan. Just type the stock
symbol in the Quotes box, press Enter, and then click the Data Interpre-
ter link on the left side of the new page that appears. After the Data
Interpreter page loads, check out the Morningstar Style Box on the right,
which uses a nine-by-nine grid (see Figure 13-1) to show you if the stock
is large, mid-sized or small. (The grid also tells you whether the stock is
value priced or a growth stock.)
 Does the stock have solid fundamentals? When you pick apart a com-
pany’s financial statements as described in Chapter 11, you’re doing
what’s known as fundamental analysis. Essentially, you determine how
fast the company’s revenue and earnings are growing and examine the
management. (Pretty much all you need to know about fundamental
analysis can be found in Chapter 11.) 
 Does the stock stack up favorably against the competition? Companies
that have a defendable edge against rivals — typically thanks to a strong
brand name — can remain more profitable. (I show you how to find a
company’s competitors in Chapter 6.)
284

 Is the price for the stock reasonable? You’ll want to study how much
other investors are paying for the stock before you jump in. Overpaying
for a good company is just as bad as overpaying for a bad one. You
might lose money in both cases. You see how to measure a stock’s valua-
tion in the “Quick ways to determine how pricey a stock is” section, later
in this chapter. 
A stock’s price alone doesn’t tell you how expensive or cheap a stock is.
Just because one company’s stock price is $100 and another company’s
stock is trading for $1 doesn’t mean the $1-a-share company is cheaper.
The stock’s share price must be compared with something else, such as
earnings or revenue, to determine its value. 
Quick ways to determine 
how pricey a stock is
Determining whether a stock is cheap or overvalued is an arduous process
that can be a full-time job even for investment pros. Luckily, there’s one quick
way you can get an idea of how pricey a stock is: valuation ratios. Valuation
ratios give you a rough idea of a stock’s value by comparing the stock price
with a measure from the company’s financial statements.

Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects

Most financial Web sites that provide stock quotes, including the ones 
discussed in Chapter 2, provide several valuation ratios. Reuters (www.
investor.reuters.com), for instance, provides you with nearly all the
important valuation measures on one screen. Just enter the stock symbol in
the Enter Symbol text field (you have to scroll down to find it), select the
Ratios radio button, and then click Go. The Ratios page for the stock you
chose appears, displaying more ratios than you can shake a stick at. 
Table 13-1 lists a few valuation ratios you should pay the most attention to.
Table 13-1
Guide to Valuation Ratios That Matter
Valuation Ratio
It Tells You How Much Investors . . .
Price to earnings 
Are willing to pay for each dollar in earnings the company 
(P-E) 
generates. P-E is measured by dividing stock price by the 
company’s annual earnings. A high P-E tells some investors
the stock is overvalued, and a low P-E shows it’s undervalued. 
Price to sales
Are paying for each dollar the company brings in as rev-
enue. It’s the company’s stock price divided by its annual
revenue. This ratio is typically used to value early-stage
companies, like biotech firms, that lose money so they don’t
have a P-E ratio. 
286
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
In search of low returns 
Investors figure if they buy the stocks of “good
companies,” they’ll get great returns. But
research has shown that’s not true. Companies
that are growing and have popular products, 
but are so trendy with investors that their
shares have lofty valuations, tend to be poor
investments. 
It’s not just theory. In Tom Peters’ 1982 book
called In Search of Excellence, Peters, a man-
agement expert, extolled companies he deter-
mined to be the best. Had you bought $100
worth of stock in these excellent companies in
1981, your investment would have grown 82% to
$182 through 1985, according to research by
market strategist Michelle Clayman. But here’s
the funny part: Clayman created a portfolio of
“unexcellent” companies missing all the things
that made the excellent companies great. The
same $100 invested in these unexcellent com-
panies outperformed the excellent ones by a
wide margin. The same $100 invested in the
unexcellent companies jumped 198% and
turned into $298. The counterintuitive idea that
the best companies are often not the best
stocks is described at length at Damodaran
Online (http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/
~adamodar/pdfiles/invfables/ch6
new.pdf), a site dedicated to stock valuations
maintained by Aswath Damodaran, Professor of
Finance at New York University. 

Valuation Ratio
It Tells You How Much Investors . . .
Price to book value
Are paying for each dollar of the company’s assets, minus
money owed to others. The price-to-book ratio is the
stock’s price divided by the company’s book value per
share. A company’s book value measures the value of what
it owns (assets) minus what it owes (liabilities). The price-
to-book ratio is very important and is a key measure used to
determine whether a stock is a value-priced stock or a
growth stock. A low price-to-book ratio, typically 1 or lower,
might signal an undervalued stock. 
Price to tangible 
Are paying for each dollar of physical assets owned by 
book value
the company. It’s the stock price divided by the com-
pany’s book value per share, excluding assets you can’t 
touch or feel.
Price-earnings 
Are willing to pay for the company’s earnings growth. The 
to growth 
price-earnings to growth (or PEG) ratio compares a 
company’s P-E ratio to its expected growth rate. The PEG is
calculated by dividing the stock’s P-E by its expected
growth rate. A PEG of two or higher tells investors that the
stock is either expected to grow very rapidly or the stock is
overvalued. Reuters doesn’t give you the PEG, but it gives you
the P-E and the growth rate, so you can easily figure it out.
Price to free cash 
Value each dollar of cash that flows into the company as 
flow
part of its doing business. It’s the stock price divided by free 
cash flow.
Dividend yield
Receive in dividends relative to the stock price. The divi-
dend yield is the company’s annual dividend payment
divided by the stock price. If a $30 stock has a dividend
yield of 5%, that means it is paying $1.50 per share every
year in dividends ($30 × 5% = $1.50). Stocks with high divi-
dend yields are seen as potentially being undervalued.
The P-E ratio is the rock star of valuation ratios and gets most of the atten-
tion. The P-E is popular because it’s easy to understand. Imagine a stock
price is $30 a share, and the company earned $1.50 a share. That means
investors are paying a price that’s 20 times higher than the company’s earn-
ings. If the price of earnings, or P-E, is high, it means the earnings are very
valuable to other people, usually because they expect the company to grow
rapidly.
Still confused about what a P-E means? Imagine that a company put all the
money it earned per share during the year in a box, promised to add more
money if it was profitable in the future, and auctioned it off. Say the company
287
Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects

earned $1 a share, so there was $1 in the box. If investors paid $1 for the box,
the stock would have a P-E of 1. But if a bidding war ensued and someone
paid $20 for the box containing a dollar of earnings, the stock would have a 
P-E of 20. 
P-Es can get more complicated because different people measure earnings
differently. A trailing P-E divides the stock price by the company’s earnings
over the past four quarters. A forward P-E divides the stock price by what the
company is expected to earn over the next four quarters. Both ways to mea-
sure P-E are correct; just know which one you’re talking about. Google Finance
(http://finance.google.com) gives both the trailing P-E and the forward
P-E. Just enter the stock’s symbol into the search field, click the Search
Finance button, and look for the P/E item (trailing) and F P/E item (forward)
on the new page that appears.
Ways to interpret valuations
If you took a look at Chapter 1 and figured out from my discussion there that
you’re a passive (as opposed to an active) investor, you’re probably pretty
sure that the stock price actually measures what one share of a stock is
worth, or its fair value. If the market is willing to pay $20 for a stock, the stock
is worth $20. Passive investors believe markets are efficient over the long
term and set stock prices that reflect all available public information. But
active investors (including bargain hunters known as value investors) believe
the stock market is inefficient and tends to over or underpay for stocks from
time to time. These investors try to find out whether a stock is too expensive
or cheap by studying its valuation ratios and comparing them with 
 The rest of the market: Some investors compare valuation ratios, such
as the price-to-book and dividend yield, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
to get an idea of whether the company might be undervalued. If the valu-
ation ratios are lower than the S&P 500’s, that tells some investors the
stock might be undervalued. 
S&P provides data on its index’s valuation at www.spglobal.com.
Concentrate on finding out the following:
• Dividend yield: Click the United States link under the Equity Indices
heading of the S&P Global Indices page — the www.spglobal.com
address. In the new page that appears, click the S&P 500 link under
the Major Indices heading. When the page refreshes, click the Data
tab at the top of the page and then click the Earnings link in the
Index Table box. On the new page that appears, click the Click Here
link in the middle of the page. A spreadsheet pops up on your
screen. At the top of the spreadsheet you see the S&P 500’s divi-
dend yield over the last 12 months. It’s a little tricky to find, but
Figure 13-2 should help you.
288
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

• P-E ratio: The same spreadsheet you downloaded in the preceding
bullet gives you the S&P 500’s P-E over several years. Notice the As
Reported Earns P/E column, which lists the S&P’s P-E at the end of
each quarter. Notice as well that the P-E ratio rises and falls as
investors get bullish and bearish about stocks and the economy.
 The industry: It’s also a good idea to compare a stock’s valuation ratios
with other stocks in the industry. Some industries tend to grow more
slowly and almost always have a lower valuation than the stock market.
That means the only way to know whether a stock’s valuation is truly
lower than average is to compare it with the ratios of similar companies. 
Reuters’ Ratios pages, described in the previous section, give you valua-
tion ratios for individual stocks in addition to the industry and stock
market. Enter the stock’s symbol into the Enter Symbol text field, click
the Ratios radio button and click Go. You’ll see how the ratios compare
with the company’s industry, sector, and the S&P 500. If you’d like to dig
a bit deeper, Damodaran Online (http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/
~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pbvdata.html) provides
price-to-book ratios for many industries.
Some investors completely ignore P-E ratios. These investors figure that
good companies are worth paying more for and deserve higher P-Es. In
these investors’ minds, a high P-E is justified just as a Monet deserves a
bigger price tag than a velvet Elvis painting sold at a flea market. These

289
Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects

investors tend to pay more attention to how fast a company is growing
and patterns in its price movements. )I discuss such investors in greater
detail in the “Taking It Further: Technical Analysis and Initial Public
Offerings” bonus chapter on the book’s companion Web site.
 Guidelines: Investors typically have a general idea of what they think
makes a cheap or expensive stock. Some investors, for instance, think a
stock is reasonably priced if the PEG is less than 2. You can calculate a
stock’s PEG yourself by dividing the P-E by the growth rate, or you can
get it from Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) by entering
the stock symbol into the search field, clicking Get Quotes, and scrolling
down the new page that appears. You see the PEG ratio on the right side,
in the Analyst table. MoneyChimp (www.moneychimp.com/articles/
valuation/peg.htm) provides more information about the PEG ratio.
Investor Home (www.investorhome.com/anomfun.htm) provides a
few guidelines for you to follow regarding other valuation ratios. 
 Index membership: Most of the major providers of stock market indexes
categorize stocks as being value or growth. The index providers have
sophisticated screens that rank stocks based on a number of valuation
metrics. If you’re not sure whether a company you’re considering is a
growth or value stock, you can see which index it fits in. For instance, if
you want a list of the largest value-priced stocks, go to S&P’s Web site
(www.spglobal.com) and click the United States link under the Equity
Indices heading. In the new page that appears, scroll down and then
click the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth and Pure Value link. (It’s under
the Style Indices heading.) If you then click the Constituent List link near
the top of the new page that appears and then the S&P/Citigroup Pure
Style Constituents link, you can download a list of all the largest stocks
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and see whether the company you’re
considering is ranked as value or growth.
Studying stocks using automated tools
Is your head spinning with all this talk of P-Es, book value, and ratios? Don’t
worry. There are several online tools that will hold your hand through the
process of analyzing a stock’s valuation. The following list highlights sites
that are excellent places to start to get you thinking about what goes into
evaluating a company’s stock price and whether it might fit in your portfolio:
 MSN Money’s Stock Research Wizard: (http://moneycentral.msn.
com/investor) This corner of MSN Money steps you through the
process of evaluating a stock from beginning to end. Just enter the
stock’s ticker symbol into the Symbol(s) field, click Get Quote, and then
click the Research Wizard link on the left side of the new page that
appears. The wizard first steps you through the company’s fundamen-
tals, going over many of the things I tell you to look for in Chapter 11.

You then see how the company’s P-E compares with other companies’ 
P-Es in its industry. 
 Quicken’s Stock Evaluator: (www.quicken.com/investments/
seceval) This site is the online presence of the popular financial soft-
ware program. You need a member ID and password to access this
corner of the Quicken site, but once you do, the Stock Evaluator tool
takes you step by step through a five-part analysis of any stock you
enter into the Enter Symbol(s) field. Stock Evaluator analyzes stocks’
growth trends, financial health, management performance, valuation and
intrinsic value. You can register for the site for free, but you must own a
copy of Quicken that’s three years old or newer.
 Value Point Analysis Model: (www.eduvest.com/vpaff2.html)
Developed by the folks at the Value Point Analysis Financial Forum, the
Value Point Analysis Model asks you to enter basic company information
about a stock, including many of the things I tell you to look out for in
Chapter 11. A few of the things you must enter include the company’s
number of shares outstanding, long-term debt, current dividend, pro-
jected earnings, and current stock price. After you get all that stuff
entered, click the Execute button, and the Web site tells you what it
thinks the stock is worth — what the site calls its Value Point.

Shortcomings of studying 
stocks’ valuation ratios
I don’t want to leave you with a misconception many investors have: Just find
“cheap” stock with a low valuation, buy it, hold on to it forever, and you’ll
make money. Unfortunately, investing isn’t that easy. There are several prob-
lems with using valuation ratios alone to pick stocks, including the following:
 Cheap stocks might be cheap for a reason: Sometimes a stock has a 
low valuation because the company is poorly run, it’s in a slow or no-
growth industry, or other companies or technologies are stealing away
customers. 
 You get what you pay for: Sometimes a company might appear to be
overvalued and have a high P-E. But if the company’s profits grow by a
huge amount, the P-E will fall and the stock price may skyrocket. 
If a company reports strong earnings, a stock’s P-E can suddenly go from
looking high to looking low. The P-E is the stock price divided by earn-
ings. That means if earnings, the denominator of the fraction, rise
rapidly, the P-E plunges. Imagine a company trading for $40 a share that
has posted earnings over the past four quarters of $1 a share. That gives
the stock a pricey-looking P-E of 40. But if the company’s quarterly profit
surges and pushes earnings to $2, the P-E falls to a more reasonable 20.
 Dividends aren’t a contract: Some investors target companies with high
dividend yields. They figure these stock’s prices are temporarily
depressed. And, as a bonus, even if the stock doesn’t go up, they get
paid their dividend. 
Watch out, though. Dividend payments aren’t written in blood.
Companies can cut or stop their dividend payments at any time. 
The Armchair Investor’s 
Way to Not Overpay
If you want to buy cheap stocks, but studying P-E ratios and price-to-book
ratios make your head swim, there’s an easy shortcut: Buy an index mutual
fund or an exchange-traded fund that owns value-priced stocks. That way,
you own stocks that are in value indexes. Generally, the companies that
create indexes use many measures to determine whether a stock is value or
growth. S&P (www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/SP_US_
Style_Indices_Methodology_Web.pdf) ranks companies by book value,
cash flow, sales, and dividend yield to see whether a stock is a value stock. If
you’re interested in finding index mutual funds that mirror value stock
indexes, check out Chapter 10. For exchange traded funds that do the same
thing, check out the “Finding and Buying Exchange-Traded Funds” bonus
chapter on the Web site associated with this book.

Evaluating Stocks’ Potential 
Return and Risk
If you’re taking a gamble on a stock, you’d better get an ample return to make
it worth your while. I tell you how to measure your portfolio’s risk and return
in Chapter 8. It turns out that you can apply the same techniques to individ-
ual stocks. I show you how.
Measuring a stock’s total return
Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but studying how stocks
have done in the past can help you get a very crude handle on what to expect.
To find how stocks have done previously, you need their total return in previ-
ous years. A stock’s total return is the amount its price has gone up — its
price appreciation — plus its dividend. You can get a stock’s total return by
the following methods:
 Checking the company’s Web site: Some companies include total return
calculators in the Investor Relations section of their Web sites.
 Calculating it by using online stock price downloading services:
You can download a stock’s annual stock price for different years using

Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
The Four (headless) Horsemen of the Internet 
Despite the problems with valuation ratios —
problems described elsewhere in this section —
they’re still a good way to get a quick idea of
how highly valued a stock is. When you start
seeing stocks’ P-E ratios going above 60, though,
you should get suspicious. Few stocks are able
to maintain such lofty valuations before getting
their comeuppance, as investors realize they’ve
been too bullish. Even if the company can boost
its earnings by 100% for a year or two, eventu-
ally the industry or the company will stumble
and bring its stock back to earth. 
Internet stocks were a classic example of how
valuations were inflated as investors got caught
up in the dot-com mania. Many investors rightly
viewed the Internet as a huge phenomenon for
society and business. But, unfortunately, these
investors overpaid for Internet stocks in March
2000 and doomed themselves to lackluster
returns. Many Internet stocks vanished com-
pletely, and those that didn’t have been very
poor investments for anyone who invested at
the peak.
The valuations of Cisco, EMC, Oracle and Sun,
the leaders of the Internet nicknamed the Four
Horsemen of the Internet, soared in March 2000.
Their stock prices have since plunged, though,
erasing tremendous amounts of shareholder
wealth on the way. 

services described in Chapter 2. Add the company’s stock price at the
end of the year to the amount per share it paid in dividends during the
year. Divide that sum by the stock’s price at the end of previous year
and multiply by 100 and you’ll have the total return for the year. 
 Using Morningstar: The investment tracker (www.morningstar.com)
provides stock’s total returns going back for three years. Just enter the
stock’s symbol into the Quotes field, click the Go button, and then click
the Data Interpreter link on the left side of the new page that appears.
Ideally, you’d want more years of data than Morningstar gives you, but
it’s a start.
After you get the stock’s total returns for many years, enter them into Horton’s
Geometric Mean Calculator at www.graftacs.com/geomean.php3. (If
you’re not sure how to do that, refer to Chapter 8.) After doing that, Horton’s
Geometric Mean Calculator shows you how much you would have gained in
the stock each year on average and also how risky it is. You can then com-
pare the stock’s returns and risk with popular indexes, just as you do with
your portfolio in Chapter 8. If the stock’s returns are lower than the stock
market’s and the risk is higher, it might not be a good fit for your portfolio.
Before you decide that a stock is too risky or the returns are too low, you
should compare its movements to the rest of your portfolio. If a stock rises
when your portfolio goes down, it might actually reduce your portfolio’s total
risk by offering diversification. Some online tools can show you whether a
stock will diversify your portfolio. The Thomson South-West Simple Linear
Regression calculator (www.swlearning.com/finance/investment_
calculator/m02/LinearRegression.html) makes it easy. Enter the
stock’s total returns in the X column and your portfolio’s returns in the Y
column. The R blank shows you, on a scale from -1 to 1, how closely the 
stock tracks your portfolio. 
Don’t get bogged down with all the scary math terms. Just know this: If the R
is closer to –1, that means the stock and your portfolio are mirror images of
one another. That’s a good thing because it means if your portfolio sinks, this
stock might rise and decrease your overall risk. If the R is close to 1, the
stock and your portfolio move in lockstep, so there’s no diversification 
benefit. Microsoft (http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/
HP052090231033.aspx?pid=CH062528311033) provides instructions on
how to calculate correlations using Excel. 
Many online stock quote services let you compare several stocks by graphing
them on the same chart. An easy way to see which stock has done best than
looking at a colorful chart. Go to MSN Investor (http://moneycentral.
msn.com/investor), enter the symbol of the stock you’re interested in into
the Symbol(s) field, make sure Get Quote is selected from the drop-down list,
and click the Go button. In the new page that appears, click the Historical
294
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

link. (You can find it under the Charts option on the left side.) You can then
type additional symbols in the Compare With field and click the Add button
to plot more stocks on the charts. Don’t just compare the stock with other
stocks, though; you should also compare it with market indexes like the S&P
500 and exchange-traded funds that track narrow slices of the market. 
Finding out more about 
risk and return online
If you’re interested in learning more about how stock’s risk and return are
linked, you can consult several sites dedicated to the topic. The sites listed
here are a good start: 
 Path to Investing: (www.pathtoinvesting.org/invchoices/
stock/risk_return/ic_risk_return_011.htm) This part of the
Path to Investing site describes why it’s so important for investors to
understand the correlation between the returns they’re getting from
stocks and the risk they’re accepting. 
 Index Funds Advisors: (www.ifa.com) The IFA site helps you under-
stand how individual stocks are often riskier than baskets of stocks in
index mutual funds. 
Digging Even Deeper: Advanced
Valuation Techniques
Valuation ratios are often the most popular ways to measure how pricey
stocks are. But even proponents of valuation ratios acknowledge that such
ratios do have problems. For instance, it’s not unheard of for a stock with a
seemingly high P-E, of 50 or more, to go even higher. 
Investors use valuation ratios as general rules, but there are other more
involved ways to try to figure out whether a stock is a good buy. Some
investors try to use advanced mathematics to figure out what a company is
truly worth, or what’s sometimes called its intrinsic value.

Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects

Using the dividend discount model 
to see whether a stock is on sale
Sometimes investors get so wrapped up in the drama of online stock invest-
ing that they lose sight of what they’re buying. As a stock investor, you’re 
letting a company use your money to sell goods and services for a profit. If
the company makes money, it will ultimately give back your fair share of the
profits over time. Typically, that’s done by paying a dividend. Even young
companies that don’t pay a dividend now eventually start to as their profits
exceed their needs for cash. 
And that’s the basis of the dividend discount model approach to valuing
stocks. The idea is that most companies pay a dividend, and those that don’t
will. The size of the dividend a company pays, and how quickly it grows, can
help you figure out how much a company is worth. There’s an ugly formula
for a dividend discount model, but I’ll spare you the agony. If you can’t resist
finding out how the calculation is done, Motley Fool (www.fool.com/
research/2000/features000406.htm) provides a helpful description. 
Because this is Investing Online For Dummies, I just list a few handy places on
the Internet where you can enter a couple variables and have your computer
do the rest:
 DividendDiscountModel.com: (www.dividenddiscountmodel.com):
This aptly named site does most of the work for you and doesn’t bog
you down with knowing what goes into the sausage. Just enter a stock
symbol into the Symbol field and click the Start button, and the rest is
done. The site’s database goes out and gets all the important data for
you, ranging from the dividend and dividend yield to dividend growth
and earnings growth. DividendDiscountModel then tells you what the
stock’s expected return is.
 Thomson South-Western: (www.swlearning.com/finance/
investment_calculator/m04/consGrowth.html) This page 
offers a free calculator that may appeal to you if you’d like more control
of the assumptions being used in the model. The site can tell you how
much a stock is worth if you enter just three variables: 
• The most recent dividends: The value of the dividends paid by the
company in the most recent four quarters. 
• The required rate of return: This is the return you’re expecting from
the stock. If it’s a risky stock, your required rate of return might be
15% or much higher. And if it’s a conservative stock, you might
have a required rate of return of less than 10%.
296
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

• Expected growth rate: This specifies how rapidly you expect the
company to boost its dividend. You can either use the rate the
company has increased dividends in the past or use its expected
earnings or dividend growth rate.
The calculator spits out how much it thinks the stock is worth based on
the data you entered. 
The dividend discount model is pretty clever and is used by many serious
investment professionals. But the model has some big problems. The model
is extremely sensitive to your assumptions, especially the required rate of
return or discount rate that you enter. The discount rate is the return you
demand in return for investing your money in the company. If you enter a dis-
count rate of 10%, you get a wildly different answer than if you enter 12% or
8%. And good luck determining what a company’s growth rate will be. Still,
it’s a useful tool to get a general understanding about a fair value for a stock. 
The value hunter’s favorite weapon: 
The discounted cash flow analysis 
Ask someone who the best investor ever is, and you’ll probably hear the
name Warren Buffett. Buffett doesn’t publish a playbook that tells the world
how he picks companies. He offers some pretty good clues, though, through
his Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports. In a nutshell, Buffett tries to mea-
sure a company’s intrinsic value and buy shares of the company only when
it’s trading for less than the intrinsic value. 
Many speculate that Buffett and investors like him use what’s called the dis-
counted cash flow (DCF) analysis. The DCF method works on the assumption
that successful companies generate cash flow every year and will hopefully
generate more each year. The DCF model attempts to estimate how much
cash the company will generate over its entire lifetime and tells you how
much that cash would be worth if you got it today. If the company’s intrinsic
value is greater than the stock price, the company is a good deal. 
Time for a concrete example. Imagine that you were a lucky lottery player
and had just won a million dollars. Say the state said you could either have
the million now or wait 30 years for it. You wouldn’t even have to think about
it: You’d take the money now. You didn’t realize it, but you just did a dis-
counted flow analysis in your head. Because money received today is more
valuable than the same amount received later, you know that a million dollars
paid 30 years from now is worth less than a million paid today. 
297
Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects

The discounted cash flow analysis can get somewhat complicated. You must
first estimate a company’s free cash flow, as described in Chapter 11. Next,
you have to determine how rapidly the company’s free cash flow will grow over
the years and how much it would be worth if paid to shareholders right now.
If you’re interested in the nitty-gritty of this analysis, Incademy Investor Edu-
cation (www.incademy.com/courses/Ten-great-investors/-Warren-
Buffett/1/1040/10002) offers a helpful and in-depth description of how
the discounted cash flow model is crunched. 
Luckily, you can use online resources and get the benefits of the DCF model
without actually doing any math. Check out the following helpful sites:
 Money Chimp: (www.moneychimp.com/articles/valuation/
dcf.htm) Definitely one of the easier discounted cash flow model sites
to use. You need to enter only five pieces of information and the Web
site will generate the stock’s value. You must enter the following data:
• Earnings per share over the past 12 months. You can also use the
company’s cash flow per share, which is probably more accurate. 
• Initial expected annual growth rate.
• Number of years earnings will grow at that pace.
• What the growth rate will fall to after the initial growth period. 
• The return you can get on a similar investment. If the stock is a large
company stock, you would enter the 10.3% average return of the
S&P 500 here.
Money Chimp does all the math for you and tells you how much the
stock is worth. If you’re interested in the approach Buffett uses, Money
Chimp also provides a slightly different discounted cash flow model
believed to be more similar to Buffett’s approach at www.moneychimp.
com/articles/valuation/buffett_calc.htm.
 Valuation Technologies: (www.valtechs.com/r2.shtml) This site
offers several different online worksheets that use discounted cash flow
and dividend discount model techniques. The first worksheet lets you
enter future cash flows and find out what they’d be worth if received
today. The second one estimates a stock’s value based on its dividend
track record. And the last one measures the value of a company that
slows down as it ages. It’s an interesting site because it provides text
that explains how the calculations are performed.

from the Global Value Investing site offering all sorts of free valuation
calculators. Read the Intro text and then click the Portal link to find the
model that fits your needs.

 Expectations Investing: (www.expectationsinvesting.com) This
site takes the discounted cash flow analysis and turns it on its head. The
site owners, Alfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at Northwestern
University, and Legg Mason Capital money manager Michael Mauboussin
say investors should examine a stock’s price first and then work back-
wards. By dissecting the stock price, you can figure out what the major-
ity of other investors expect the company’s cash flow and growth to be.
Then you can decide whether the market is expecting too much or too
little. You can read about the approach in the tutorials section and also
download all the spreadsheets you need to do the analysis yourself. 
 Damodaran Online: (http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar)
NYU Finance professor Aswath Damodaran offers dozens of advanced
valuation models that use variations of both the dividend discount
model and the discount cash flow model. The site even has a “right
model” spreadsheet that tells you which valuation model to use.
 NewConstructs: (www.newconstructs.com) This site uses a sophisti-
cated discounted cash flow model that does everything for you. It enters
all the data from its database, adjusts the company’s financial state-
ments to the appropriate format, and crunches all the math. That’s the
good part. The bad part is that access to the system is expensive.
NewConstructs, however, provides reports on some individual stocks
through Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) that cost less than
access to NewContructs’ site. Just go to the Yahoo! Finance site, enter
the symbol of the stock you’re interested in into the search field, and
click Get Quotes. On the new page that appears, click the Research

O
ne of the most popular questions investors ask is “What stock should I
buy?” These investors figure that, amid the pile of thousands of publicly
traded stocks, there’s a handful of stocks that will be the big winners for the
year. They’re right. There will be stocks that are big winners and big losers
each year. The problem, though, is that no one knows ahead of time which
ones. 
No online tool can tell you what stocks will be next year’s winners. But, some
online resources and databases can help you find stocks with traits you believe
make them likely candidates.
This chapter shows you how online screening tools are your best friend when
you’re trying to sort through thousands of stocks for those you might want 
to own. Online screening tools scour Wall Street for stocks that meet criteria
you set. I show you a few of the top online stock screening tools and give you
some pointers on how to use them. You also find out about many ways you
can filter stocks and how to pick criteria for your screen. I also cover meth-
ods to compare companies with their peers or other companies. 

Getting Familiar with Stock Screens
No one person can do in-depth analysis of all the publicly traded stocks out
there. There’s just not enough time. Even large Wall Street investment compa-
nies, with giant teams of researchers, can only study so many stocks. But 
that doesn’t mean you want to miss out on stocks that might belong in your
portfolio. 
Stock screening tools are the answer. Screening tools are systems that let you
describe what kind of stock you’re looking for, and then the screening tool
returns a list of results to you. The screening tool searches through thou-
sands of stocks in a database and find the ones that match your parameters. 
Stock screening tools aren’t all that different from online dating services. Say
you’re looking for a mate with dark brown hair and brown eyes who likes to
run and follow the stock market. You can enter those traits into an online
dating service and get a list of people who match. Similarly, stock screens are
excellent tools to help you come up with a list of stocks that might be attrac-
tive. You enter a list of traits for the stock such as the industry, growth rate,
and valuation. After you get a list of the companies that fit your criteria, you
have a smaller and more manageable list of stocks you can study more closely. 
Investors who use online stock screening tools benefit in a number of ways:
 Less time wasted: Screening tools keep you from wasting time studying
companies that aren’t appropriate. You can design your stock screen to
throw out companies that are undesirable to you for certain reasons,
such as having too much debt or too little profit. 
 No stone unturned: Screening tools can highlight stocks you might have
overlooked. One of the best things about stock screens is that they’re
dispassionate and robotic. Screens don’t get caught up in marketing
hype — they look only at the numbers. That means screens might find
stocks you’ve overlooked because you weren’t familiar with the compa-
nies’ products.
 Great head-to-head comparisons: Screening tools are great when it
comes to comparing stocks. Stock screens are built using specific 
financial metrics and ratios, which are calculated for all stocks. Online
screening tools allow you to rank companies against each other based
on these objective measures. 
The biggest gripe about stock screens is that they do only what they’re told.
If you filter stocks using meaningless variables, your results are only as good
as the elements you’re searching for.
302
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

How you can create an online screen
There are many stock screening sites and they all work slightly differently.
But the general procedure of getting into the screening game is essentially
the same:
1. Choose a screening site. 
I discuss several of the Web sites that provide free or low-cost screening
tools later in this chapter.
2. Decide what kind of stock you’re looking for. 
Perhaps you’re trying to find a stock that fits your asset allocation. Are
you looking for a company that’s being ignored by other investors and
should therefore be considered value-priced? Are you trying to find a
fast-growing company that will blow away earnings forecasts? Are you
looking for a stable stock that pays a large dividend? You can find all
these types of stocks by using screens.
3. Pick measurable traits shared by stocks and companies you’re 
looking for. 
I show you general traits that you can include in your search, as well as
premade screens where professionals have already created the search
criteria so you don’t have to spend your time doing it. 
4. Refine your screen.
Screening for stocks is a bit of a trial-and-error process. At first, the list
of companies that meet your standards might be too large. You can
make the criteria more stringent or add additional criteria to help
narrow down the list even more. 
Now that you understand how the screening process works, the fun part
begins. The best screens are carefully designed to pinpoint stocks that have
the traits you’re looking for. When building screens, it’s best to be as specific
as possible so you find stocks that are the perfect matches for your portfolio.
General characteristics you 
can use to screen stocks
The number of characteristics you can use to screen stocks is virtually unlim-
ited. If you can measure it, you can screen stocks for it. Even so, most investors
use the following primary measures in screens:
303
Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens

 Company information: I’m talking basic elements of companies’ loca-
tion, size, or industry here. Common criteria you might use would
include the number of employees, the stock market exchange the stock
trades on, the industry the company is in, and what stock market index
the company is part of. How much money the company brings in — its
revenue, in other words — is also important. 
If you’re looking for a job and want to find companies in your area, stock
screens can be useful. Many stock screening sites let you search for
companies in certain states, and some let you search for companies in
cities. Hoovers (www.hoovers.com), although technically not a stock
screening site, is particularly good at finding companies headquartered
in specific cities.
 Trading characteristics: This category deals with how the stock has
been moving. You can search for stocks that tend to swing more or less
than the general stock market, stocks that are close to their highs or
lows, and stock that trade hands between investors more often or less
often. You can also find companies that investors are betting against by
shorting the stock. (For more on shorting stock, see Chapter 5.)
 Market value: This measures how much the company is worth. Market
value is used to determine whether a company is small, mid-sized, or
large.
 Profitability: The level of earnings and cash flow a company generates
is of utmost importance to investors. Not surprisingly, you can search
on both earnings and cash flow. You can drill down even further by look-
ing for specific things about profits, including how quickly profit has
grown over the most recent quarter, year, or over the longer term. 
 Analyst ratings: Analysts often evaluate stocks and rate them as a Buy,
Hold, or Sell. You can set up your screen so that it finds stocks with a
certain rating. Analysts ratings are covered in more detail in Chapter 14.
 Valuation ratios: Investors pay close attention to how much they’re
paying for companies, or what’s called a stock valuation. Valuations are
covered at length in Chapter 12. 
 Dividends: These periodic cash payments made by companies to share-
holders are important because they account for about a third of many
large companies’ total return. Dividends are also widely watched
because they’re an indication of a stock’s valuation. 
Many stock screens use the cryptic terms TTM and MRQ to describe the time
frame in which you’d like to base your search. TTM means trailing 12 months,
which means the most recent 12 months. MRQ is the most recent quarter. 
304
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

Choosing an online screening site
Before you can start screening, you need to pick an online screening site.
Most investors are more than satisfied with the many free screening sites
that are available, and I focus mostly on those sites. The vast majority of
these sites provide pre-made screens that you can call up immediately, with-
out programming in specific criteria. If using pre-made screens seems like
your speed, I’ll provide more details on how to do that with some of the
screening sites in the “Getting started with pre-made ‘canned’ screens” sec-
tion in this chapter. You might decide, though, that you want to go off the
beaten path a bit and build a screen exactly to your taste. I show you how to
design a screen from scratch using a few of the sites as examples in the
“Designing your own custom screens” section at the end of this chapter. No
matter if you decide to go with canned or custom screens, the screening sites
you might consider are (in no particular order):
 MSN Money’s Deluxe Screener: (http://moneycentral.msn.com/
investor/finder/customstocks.asp) MSN Money’s take on the
stock screener lets you design stock screens by using drop-down lists,
which you’re probably already familiar with from Word and other soft-
ware programs. With very little instruction, you can build elaborate
screens to quickly find companies with specific valuations, market
values, and growth rates, and you can compare companies to industry
averages. 
 MSN Money’s Stock Matcher: (http://moneycentral.msn.com/
investor/finder/matcher.asp) The Stock Matcher is a slightly dif-
ferent take on stock screening. Rather than asking you to enter charac-
teristics of stocks you’re looking for, you instead enter a stock that you
like. Stock Matcher then looks at its database for other stocks that are
similar with respect to market value, trading volume, valuation, and
stock-price changes.
 Zacks Investment Research’s Screening tool: (http://www.zacks.
com/research/screening/custom/index.php) The Zacks tool lets
you filter stocks using the standard criteria, but adds some unique
things too. For instance, you can filter stocks based on estimate uncer-
tainty, which finds stocks where analysts strongly disagree over how
much the company will earn in the next quarter. You can also find com-
panies that have surprised Wall Street the most with earnings over the
past quarters. 
 Yahoo! Finance: (http://screen.yahoo.com/stocks.html) This
particular tool focuses on the basics. You can filter stocks based on
industry, stock price, volatility, valuations, and analyst estimates. The
screener is simple and easy to use.
305
Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens

 SharpScreen: (http://nasdaq.sharpscreen.com) This NASDAQ
product, shown in Figure 14-1, provides users with an easy-to-use inter-
face that lets you build a screen in seconds. You can pinpoint stocks
based on their stock prices, earnings growth, revenue growth, industry

custom/usatoday-com/screener/screener.asp) Not one to be left
in the dust, USA TODAY has come up with its own stock screening tool,
one that lets you find stocks based on the industry they’re in, stock
price, market value, and P-E ratio. 
 Morningstar’s Stock Screener: (http://screen.morningstar.com/
StockSelector.html) The Morningstar offering in the Stock Screener
sweepstakes is designed to make it easier for beginning investors to
design sophisticated screens. Rather than requiring you to pick through
dozens of criteria you might not understand, you can just pick a Growth
Grade, Profit Grade, or Financial Health Grade, based on a scale from A
to F. After you’re done, click the Show Results tab, and you see all the
stocks that made the cut.

 Portfolio123: (www.portfolio123.com): This site provides a number
of pre-made screens that will help you find stocks with improving earn-
ings or that are industry leaders. You can access the site’s basic
screener if you register, which is free. 
 Brokerage Web sites: Many of the leading online brokers, especially
those I refer to as discounters back in Chapter 4, offer stock screening
tools on their Web sites. Charles Schwab’s stock screener, described
here (https://promo.schwab.com/AD046/AD046Home.asp?
campaign=tour&mp=res) lets you screen for many standard criteria,
but it makes things a little easier by letting you click preset ranges. It
also lets you find stocks that rank high or low with the Schwab Equity
Ratings, discussed more fully in Chapter 14. TD Ameritrade, E*Trade,
and several others provide screening tools as well. The screener is avail-
able to you if you have a Schwab account.
If you’re interested in stock screening, most online brokers sites offer a
tour or tutorial of the tools they can provide. If screens are important to
you, you might consider checking out the tools on various online bro-
kers’ sites to see whether they’re good enough for you to open an
account. 
Knowing What You’re Looking For:
Popular Screening Variables
Investors can search for countless criteria by using screens, but I’ve noticed
that certain variables routinely show up in stock screens because they’re so
useful. If you know what these variables are and why they matter, you can
build some very helpful screens.
The basics: ’Cause you have 
to start somewhere
When you’re first figuring out how to build screens, you want to start with
some of the more basic variables. That way you can get comfortable with the
idea of building screens first and then add more advanced variables as you
narrow your search. In this Basics category I’d include the following: 
 Valuation ratios: These ratios include the price-to-earnings (P-E) ratio
and price-to-book ratio. Valuation ratios are ways to compare a stock
price with the company’s value. If you’re looking for potentially under-
valued stocks, for instance, search for stocks with low P-E and price-to-
book ratios. 
307
Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens

The P-E ratio and other valuation ratios are discussed at length in
Chapter 12. 
 Shares outstanding: A company’s shares outstanding measures the total
number of shares in the hands of investors. It’s related to a company’s
float, which is the number of shares that are available to be bought and
sold by the public. When companies buy back their stock, shares are
removed from the shares outstanding and float, and they sit on the side-
lines. Those sidelined shares are called treasury stock and aren’t
included in shares outstanding. 
 Market value: This is a measure of the price tag the stock market puts
on the whole company. The market value — usually called the market
capitalization or market cap — is measured by multiplying the stock
price by its number of shares outstanding. This measure determines
whether a stock is large, mid-sized, or small. 
 Earnings per share (EPS): Earnings per share is the bottom line. It mea-
sures what portion of the company net income holders of each share of
stock are entitled to. Investors generally use diluted EPS in screens. (The
diluted EPS figure is a way to measure a company’s bottom line that fac-
tors in the effect of companies issuing large amounts of stock options to
employees.)
 Current ratio: Measures how prepared a company is to pay bills that are
due in a year’s time. You can calculate the current ratio by dividing cur-
rent assets (assets that can be turned into cash in a year or faster) by
current liabilities (bills due in a year or less). If the company’s current
ratio is 1, the company has enough assets to cover bills coming due in a
year. The higher the ratio, the more solid the company’s financial condi-
tion is.
 Revenue per employee: Shows you how efficiently the company uses its
workforce. The ratio is the company’s revenue divided by its number of
employees. The higher the number, the more revenue the company
derives from each employee. 
Getting more particular: More advanced
variables to screen for
Just using the basic screening variables is somewhat limiting. If you want to
carve the list of stock candidates down further, you can use some more
advanced variables. Good choices here include 
308
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

 Gross margin: One of many ways to measure a company’s profitability,
gross profit is how much of revenue a company keeps after paying for
things directly involved in the production of the good or service sold. 
A lemonade stand’s gross profit is the dollar value of the lemonade 
sold minus the cost of things used in the lemonade such as sugar and
lemons. This gross profit, divided by the company’s revenue, gives 
you gross margin. Gross margin tells you how much of every dollar in
sales the company keeps after paying costs directly tied to making the
good or service. The higher the gross margin, the more profitable the
company is. 
 Operating margin: This method of measuring a company’s profit
includes more costs than gross margin. Operating profit is gross profit
minus indirect costs, such as overhead. Overhead might include the 
cost of hiring a company to promote the business. Operating margin 
is the company’s operating profit divided by revenue. The higher the
operating margin, the more profitable the company.
 Net profit margin: This particular margin compares the company’s
bottom line with its revenue. Net profit is measured by dividing a com-
pany’s net income, which counts all company costs, by its revenue. It
tells you how much of each dollar in revenue the company keeps as
profit after paying all costs. The higher the net profit margin, the more
profitable the company.
 Return on equity: A great way to see how efficiently the company’s 
management is using the money invested in the company, return on
equity (ROE) is measured by dividing net income by shareholder’s
equity. Shareholder’s equity measures how much money shareholders
have invested in the company. So, ROE shows you how much profit the
company generates per dollar invested in the company. 
 Return on assets: Shows you how much profit the company is able to
squeeze out of its assets. The higher the number, the better the com-
pany is at making money from things it owns. 
 Dividend payout ratio: Tells you what portion of profit a company is
paying out as dividends. You calculate this ratio by dividing a company’s
dividends by net income. 
If a company’s dividend payout ratio gets high — paying 85% or more of
its profit out as earnings, for example — it might be paying more than it
can afford depending on what industry it is in. 
 Dividend yield: Tells you what kind of return you’re getting as a divi-
dend from the money you’ve invested in a stock. The dividend yield is 
a company’s annual dividend paid per share divided by the stock price.
A $10 stock that pays $2 a year in dividends has a 2% dividend yield.
309
Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens

 Institutional ownership: This measure tries to show you whether the
“smart money” is buying a stock. The ratio shows you what percentage
of shares are in the hands of large mutual funds and pension funds,
which presumably have large research units. Some investors look for
stocks with low institutional ownership, figuring the stock will rise
rapidly as these big investors discover the stock and buy shares. 
 Debt to equity ratio: Shows you how deeply in debt a company is. The
ratio divides a company’s liabilities by its shareholder equity. The higher
the ratio, the more leveraged, or in debt, the company is. Remember,
though, that different levels of debt are acceptable in various industries. 
 Beta: Most online screening tools use a measure called beta to gauge
volatility. The higher beta is, the more volatile the stock is compared to
the rest of the stock market. If a stock has a beta greater than 1, that
means it’s more volatile than the Standard & Poor’s 500. If a stock’s beta
is less than 1, it’s less volatile than the S&P 500. And it a stock’s beta is
equal to 1, it’s equally as volatile as the S&P 500.
If you can’t stomach stocks that swing as wildly as the stock market, you
want to add a beta filter to your screens. Just look for stocks that have
betas of less than 1.
 Short interest: Short interest measures how many investors are betting
a stock will fall. The measure is calculated by dividing the number of
shares being shorted — or being sold in a complex maneuver by
investors betting the stock price will fall — by the number of shares that
normally trade each day, or the average daily volume. (For more on
shorting stock, see Chapter 5.)
Finding stocks using trading-pattern 
variables
Some investors are interested more in a company’s stock than the company.
These investors, generally known as technical analysts, believe stocks follow
certain patterns. And if you detect the pattern fast enough, you can figure out
where the stock is going and make money. Some screening variables are
designed to find technical stock patterns including
 Average daily volume: Some investors think if there’s heavy trading in a
stock when it rises or falls, that means more than if there’s light trading
volume. If a stock goes up, these investors look at trading volume to find
out how many investors are buying. If the stock is rising and trading
activity is strong, that tells these investors there’s great demand for the
stock and the uptrend might continue. 
310
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

 Proximity to moving averages: This indicator tells you whether the 
current stock price is higher or lower than where it has been in the past.
The 200-day moving average, for instance, tells you what the stock’s
average price has been over the past trading year. If the stock falls below
the 200-day moving average, some see that as a bad sign because it
means everyone who bought the stock in the past year, on average, is
losing money and might be eager to sell. 
 Proximity to stock’s price highs and lows: You can use screens to find
out whether a stock’s price is close to its high price over the past year,
called the 52-week high, or its low price, the 52-week low.
 Stock performance: This is a simple measure that shows you how much
the stock has risen or fallen in a set period of time. 
Getting Started with Premade 
“Canned” Screens
If you’ve never built a stock screen before, you might want to first try out
some of the premade screens available on various Web sites. The Web sites
have done most of the work for you and entered in all the variables, saving
you the hassle. The following list highlights some of the better-known
“canned” stock screens: 
 Quicken’s One-Click Scorecard: (www.quicken.com/investments)
This Quicken tool takes a novel approach toward screening. It screens
stocks for those that meet the criteria described by money manager
Robert Hagstrom (www.robertghagstrom.com), author of The Warren
Buffett Way. The One-Click Scorecard seeks stocks with traits that Hag-
strom says Buffett looks for, including a high return on equity, high net
profit margin, and most importantly, a stock price that’s lower than the
company’s intrinsic value — its true worth based on how much it’s
expected to earn in the future. 
You must own a copy of Quicken that’s three years old or less to access
Quicken’s Web site. Just click the One-Click Scorecard link at the top of
the page to access the system.
Just because a stock scores high in the Robert Hagstrom screen in the
One-Click Scorecard doesn’t mean Buffett bought the stock or wants to
buy it. The screen merely tells you what stocks have traits that match
what Buffett looks for. 
311
Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens

 NASDAQ’s Guru Analysis: (www.nasdaq.com) This particular NASDAQ
canned stock screen uses preset criteria to help you determine whether
one of several famous investors would buy a stock that you’re interested
in. From the NASDAQ home page, enter the ticker symbol of the stock
you’re considering into one of the Get Up to Ten Quotes text fields and
then click the Info Quotes button. On the new page that appears, choose
Guru Analysis from the InfoQuotes drop-down list to access your Guru
Analysis results. The tool tells you whether famous former Fidelity port-
folio manager Peter Lynch, value investor Benjamin Graham, contrarian
investor David Dreman, or growth investor Martin Zweig would be inter-
ested in the stock. The GuruAnalysis is free — but you do have to regis-
ter to get access. 
 Zacks’ Predefined Screener: (www.zacks.com/research/screening/
predefined/index.php) Zacks’ entry in the predefined screener
market offers screens that focus on the key factors you’d expect, such 
as value, earnings growth, and dividend payments. But Zacks’ premade
screen also offers several criteria that highlight stocks on the move and
those enjoying the most positive or negative changes in analysts’ recom-
mendations. You can narrow down all the screens to include small, mid-
sized, or large stocks. 
 Morningstar’s Stock Screener: (www.morningstar.com) Actually,
stock screeners, because Morningstar offers a number of helpful screen-
ers with catchy and self-explanatory titles. A few of the screeners
include Low-Priced Growth Stocks, Profitable but Unloved, Bargain in
Small Caps, Aggressive Growth, Blue Chips, and Classic Companies. You
can access all these screeners by clicking the Stocks tab at Morning-
star’s home page and scrolling down the new page that appears to the
Stock Screener box on the right side.

Want to find out what stocks Buffett owns? 
The One-Click Scorecard helps you screen for
stocks with some of the traits Buffett (Warren,
not Jimmy) looks for in winning investments. But
what if you want to find out what Buffett’s
Berkshire Hathaway actually owns? 
You can find out using online tools. You can
download Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports
(http://berkshirehathaway.com/
reports.html), which list the company’s
stock investments. You can view Berkshire’s
investments at the end of 2006 in the 2006 annual
report (http://berkshirehathaway.
com/2006ar/2006ar.pdf). (Hmmm . . .
Looks like he had a thing for American Express,
Coca-Cola, Proctor & Gamble, and Wells Fargo.)

 MSN Money: (http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/home.
asp) MSN Money divides its premade screens into two categories:
Technical screens and fundamental screens. The technical screens look
for stocks that have posted a certain type of stock price performance,
such as a new high, a low, or when the stock moves above or below its
moving average. The fundamental screens look for stocks where the
companies meet specific earnings or valuation criteria. You can access
the premade screens from the MSN Money Investing page by clicking the
Stocks tab and then clicking the Stock Power Searches link from the list
on the left side of the page. (The link is under the Find Stocks heading.)
Just click the link for the screen you’re interested in, and the corre-
sponding stocks are displayed on a new page.
Most of the online screening tools in this section let you customize canned
screens. Tweaking an existing screen can be a good way to get started
because you don’t have to start from scratch. Instead, you can modify the
variables to your tastes.
Designing Your Own Custom Screens
After you start dabbling with stock screens, you’ll probably start enjoying it.
You can get a rush sifting through thousands of stocks for precise variables
and get a list of candidates in a matter of seconds. Many investors, when they
realize what stock screening is and how easy it is to do, can get kind of
addicted to building screens. 
The premade screens described in the preceding section cover most of the
main searches investors would want to do. But sometimes, a canned screen
isn’t good enough. Many of the same sites that offer canned screens also let
you create a screen from scratch. You might consider building a screen from
the ground up if you encounter the following issues with a premade screen: 
 The screen is too lenient. A premade screen might not be as restrictive
as you’d like. That’s especially true when searching for value-priced
stocks because investors’ opinions on what makes a cheap stock varies.
A canned screen might consider a P-E of 10 to be cheap, but you might
want to limit the list to stocks with P-E of less than 8 or even 5. 
 The screen is not aggressive enough. If you’re looking for a company
that’s expanding very rapidly, you might want to ratchet up what it takes
to get into your screen. Many screens consider 20% annual earnings
growth to be rapid, but you might want 30% or more. 
313
Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens

 The screen is not to your taste. Some investors go after stocks that defy
characterization. You might want to find stocks with high P-E ratios and
low price-to-book ratios, which are unusual things to look for at the
same time. You need to build these personalized screens yourself.
Finding different industries’ best 
companies using MSN Money
If you’re trying to figure out which companies in an industry are performing
the best or worst, MSN Money’s screening tool makes it easy:
1. Point your browser to MSN Money’s screening tool at http://money
central.msn.com/investor/finder/customstocks.asp.
2. Choose Company Basics➪Industry Name from the first row’s Field
Name drop-down list.
An equal sign (=) should appear in the Operator text field. If not, click
the text field and choose the equal sign from the drop-down list that
appears.
3. From the Value drop-down list, choose the industry you’re interested in. 
4. Use the second row’s Field Name drop-down list to define what you
mean by a “best company.”
The definition of a “best company” is in the eyes of the beholder. You
might, for instance, want companies with return on equity that’s higher
than the industry’s. To find companies with an industry-beating return
on equity, you’d choose Investment Return➪Return on Equity from the
menu, choose >= from the Operator menu, and then choose Investment
Return➪Industry Average Return on Equity from the Value drop-down
list. Your screen should look something like Figure 14-2.
5. Add more variables.
Filling in the second row automatically added a new blank row. That
means you can keep working your way down, adding different criteria if
you choose. You can add criteria that will find stocks that miss, match,
or exceed industry averages on a variety of things, including price-to-
book, price-to-earnings, revenue per employee, and many other items.
6. Click the Run Search button.
Your Search results appear on a new page, displaying the leading compa-
nies that beat the industry.

the top.
You could go for Large Value, for example.
3. Limit your search further if you want.
You can narrow your search further, based on growth or profitability
grades and other items.
4. When you’re done, click the Show/Score Results tab at the top of the

 Understanding the “whisper number”

W
hen you’re looking to make a big purchase, such as a car, house, or
big-screen TV, you probably ask other people questions before making
your decision. You might ask a friend or family member for their recommen-
dation or consult with a magazine or Web site that ranks products. 
Recommendations play an important role for some investors when picking
stocks, too. Traditional brokers have long made it their business to recom-
mend stocks for their clients to buy. And even before the hot dogs hit the
grill, many family barbeques start sounding like an investment club meeting
as everyone brags about their winners (and somehow fail to mention stocks
they’ve lost money on). Many financial TV shows feature guests who can fire
off stock tips. 
Stock recommendations are impossible to avoid, and that makes them 
important to think about. There are smart ways, though, to handle recom-
mendations. In this chapter, I show you various online resources for stock
recommendations as well as how to interpret them. You get a chance to read
about different stock-picking newsletters and sites and how to evaluate them.
And I show you some new online sites that reveal how other individual
investors rate stocks. 

Picking Apart Professional 
Analyst Reports
Nearly all the major Wall Street brokerage firms have teams of research 
sell-side analysts. It’s the sell-side analyst’s job to study companies and 
tell investors who are clients of the brokerage firm which stocks are attrac-
tive. You can also find independent research firms — research groups not 
connected with a brokerage firm that analyze stocks and sell their research. 
Blindly following “buy” or “sell” recommendations is generally a bad idea.
Smart investors know how to scan through research reports to pick out impor-
tant insights on the company or industry. Later in this chapter, I show you how
to quickly pull the most important information out of analyst reports.
How to access analyst reports online
Before you can analyze research reports, you have to get your hands on
them. There are several techniques to do this online — some that will cost
you money, but many that won’t. The following list highlights a few resources
of both the free and not-so-free types: 
 Online brokers: You don’t have to be a client of the full-service brokerage
firms like Credit Suisse or Goldman Sachs to get their analysts’ research
reports. Online brokers can sometimes get the goods for you. Charles
Schwab, for instance, allows you to download reports from Goldman
Sachs and E*Trade offers access to Credit Suisse reports. Most online
brokers also offer access to independent research, including reports
from Standard & Poor’s, Argus, and Morningstar. Getting research from
your online broker is generally the best route because there’s usually 
no charge.
 Research providers: Some independent research providers sell their
reports directly to investors. Standard & Poor’s, for instance, sells reports
on more than 5,000 companies. (See http://sandp.ecnext.com/
coms2/page_industry2 for a listing.) The reports include a forecast of
what the stock’s future price could be, called a target price, in addition to
an analysis of the company’s earnings. The reports often cost around $35. 
S&P reports also use an easy-to-understand rating system. S&P rates
thousands of stocks using a star rating system where the most attractive
stocks are given five stars and the least attractive stocks get one star. If
your broker offers S&P reports, you can get the S&P ratings from the top
of the reports. Also, S&P provides a few of its ratings for free in its The
Outlook site (www.outlook.standardandpoors.com). Scroll down
318
Part III: Maximizing Invvestment Knowledge 

and on the left side in the light blue area you see a link that says High
Yield stars. Click that link to get a list of the highest-rated stocks that
pay large dividends.
Don’t assume that just because stock research comes from an indepen-
dent research firm, it’s more accurate or better. Sometimes research
from Wall Street brokerage firms is very good. The quality of research
varies greatly and largely depends on the strength of the specific analyst
covering the stock. I show you how to track down the best analysts on
various stocks in the “Determining which Wall Street analysts are worth
listening to” section, later in this chapter.
 Research resellers: Yahoo! Finance allows you to search for research
reports on specific companies or by specific firms with the help of its
Report Screener tool (http://screen.yahoo.com/reports.html).
Some of the reports are free, but you must pay for most of them. Prices
range from just $15 to more than $100. You can also buy research reports
from Reuters (www.reuters.com/investing) by entering the stock’s
symbol into the Enter Symbol field, selecting the Analyst Research radio
button and clicking the Go button.
 Summary sites: If you want just the bottom line recommendations from
analysts, several sites summarize the data. Nearly all the Web sites that
provide stock quotes also compile analyst recommendations. Some
examples include
• Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) has a comprehen-
sive database of analyst recommendations. Enter a stock symbol
into the search field at the top of Yahoo! Finance, for instance, click
the Get Quotes button and then click the Analyst Opinion link on 
the left side of the new page that appears. You see how analysts, 
on average, are rating the stock and also the stock’s average price
target — what most of the analysts, on average, expect the stock’s
price to be in a year or less. You can find out from Yahoo! Finance
whether analysts raised their opinion on a stock, called upgrading,
or cut their opinion, called downgrading.
• Reuters (www.reuters.com/investing) provides analyst 
recommendations if you enter a stock symbol and click 
the Recommendations radio button before you click Go. 
• Zacks Investment Research (www.zacks.com) provides brokerage
recommendations at the bottom of the stock quote page. Just
enter a stock’s symbol into the Quote text field, click Go, and 
scroll down the new page that appears. Pay close attention to the
average brokerage recommendation (ABR), a number that will fall
somewhere between 1 and 5. If the ABR is 1 that means analysts, 
on average, rank the stock a strong buy. If the ABR is 5, analysts, on
average, rank the stock a strong sell. Zacks also ranks stock ratings
by industry.
319
Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers

• NASDAQ.com (www.nasdaq.com) offers a handy guide to upgrades
and downgrades for all stocks, not just those that trade on the
NASDAQ. Scroll down to find the Analyst Changes section, where
you can see how many stocks were upgraded or downgraded that
day. Click the number for upgrades, for instance, and you can get
stocks’ names.
Most summary sites convert stock ratings into numbers on a one-to-five
scale, where 1 is a “strong buy” or “outperform” and 5 is a “strong sell” or
“underperform.”
Determining which Wall Street 
analysts are worth listening to
Don’t just assume research from an independent analyst is better than
research from a sell-side analyst. What really matters is performance. If an
320
Part III: Maximizing Invvestment Knowledge 
When “hold” really means “sell”
Research reports issued by Wall Street investment
banks got a bad rap in 2002. That’s when the former
New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer began inves-
tigating a number of internal e-mails sent within 
several large Wall Street brokerage firms. The
e-mails allegedly indicated that sell-side analysts
routinely issued glowing “strong buy” and “buy” 
ratings on stocks they had serious reservations 
about. During the Internet boom, for instance, 
for every stock with a sell rating, there were 
100 stocks with a buy rating, according to the
University of Pennsylvania (www.upenn.edu/
researchatpenn/article.php?76&bus).
Those ratings proved to be overly optimistic in many
cases, and some investors who followed the
research suffered large losses as a result. The 
regulators alleged analysts promoted stocks of com-
panies the brokerage firms hoped to sell lucrative
investment banking services to. The analysts, in turn,
would receive bonuses resulting from the business
that came from the companies they wrote positively
about. The investigations resulted in dramatic
reforms in the way investment banks handled stock
research. 
In 2003, ten investment banking firms agreed to a
settlement with regulators in which they would pay
roughly $1.4 billion in various penalties and fees in
connection to issuing allegedly misleading research
reports. (See the SEC page at www.sec.gov/
news/press/2003-54.htm for more about
the case.)
The settlement resulted in several changes to
research that affect online investors. One of the
significant outcomes of the settlement included
the requirement that Wall Street investment firms
make their analysts’ ratings and price targets
available to the public. By giving investors access
to analysts’ track records, investors gained the
ability, thanks to several Web sites, to see which
analysts might be worth listening to and which
ones to ignore. Following the reforms, perhaps
due to the greater accountability, analyst ratings
improved in accuracy.

analyst is always wrong, independent or not, you probably don’t want to
listen to his or her advice.
But how do you find out which analysts are the best? These two online tools
can help you find the best analysts: 
 Investars: (www.investars.com) This site offers a free version of its
analyst tracking service, called Investars Light, to individual investors.
You can search the Investars database to find out which research firms
and individual analysts are the most accurate and look up ratings based
on sectors and individual stocks. 
To get started, just click the green Enter button under the Investars
Light box on the front page to call up the screen displayed in Figure 15-1.
From there, you can get started searching the analyst-tracking database. 
Most often, you’ll probably want to get the ratings and performance of
analysts who cover a particular individual stock. To do this, click the

 StarMine: (www.starmine.com): StarMine lets investors view lists that
rank the top analysts. You can find the best overall analysts and firms
and also find the ones that are the most accurate in specific industry
sectors, such as financial, industrials, and utilities. 
StarMine’s own Web site is geared for professional money managers and Wall
Street firms. If you’re not part of that crowd, the easiest way to get StarMine
data is through Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com). Enter the
stock’s symbol in the search field at the top of the page, click the Get Quotes
button, and then click the Star Analysts link on the left side of the new page
that appears. (The link is under Analyst Coverage heading.) On the new page
that appears, you see a list of the top-ranked analysts on the stock for the
last two years. The page also has an EPS Accuracy link you can click to find
out which analysts have been the best at predicting the company’s earnings
per share (EPS), as well as an Industry Excess Return link you can click to see
which analysts’ recommendations have outperformed the industry group by
the widest margin. 
What to look for in an analyst report
Many investors who read Wall Street analyst reports tend to concentrate 
on the analyst’s rating. These investors want to know instantly whether the
stock is rated a Buy, Hold, or Sell.
Savvy investors often skip past the analyst’s rating on a stock. Much of the
worthwhile information in an analyst report isn’t in the rating, but in the
insights about the company, management, and industry. Investopedia (www.
investopedia.com/articles/01/013101.asp) provides a useful guide
in how to read analysts’ research reports. 
Pay the most attention to these portions of the report: 
 Industry comparisons: Many Wall Street analysts are assigned to cover
companies in a specific industry. As a result, these analysts spend time
going to industry conferences; meeting with employees, customers, 
and suppliers to build deep knowledge of industry trends. Industry 
information is one of the top things you should look for. Pay special
attention to any signs that one company is taking market share from
other competitors. 
 Channel checks: The better industry analysts take the time to see how
much of the product that companies are shipping is actually making it
into the hands of customers. The process of tracking the flow of goods
from the company to warehouses to resellers and retailers and ultimately
322
Part III: Maximizing Invvestment Knowledge 

to consumers is called a channel check. If you get the feeling the company
is shipping product that’s just stacking up on retailers’ shelves, that’s 
a bad sign. A pileup of product might indicate the company is trying to
boost its earnings in the short term and might suffer later as the glut of
products is sold off. 
 Price-target justification: Analysts often use a variety of stock valuation
techniques (explained in more detail in Chapter 13) to put a price target
on a stock. A price target is the analyst’s best guess at how much the
stock might be worth in the future, usually one year from now. The most
interesting part of the price target is often analysts’ explanation of how
they arrived at the number. 
Pssst . . . understanding 
the “whisper number”
Many analysts put their MBAs to good use and pick apart the financial state-
ments of companies to determine how much the stocks are truly worth. But,
some analysts take the lazy way out by blindly following the forecast given to
them by the company. This presents a problem for online investors because
companies can steer some analysts to lower their expectations for growth.
And if the company is successful in lowering the earnings bar, it’s easier for
the company to beat the results. The opposite can happen, too. A company
might convince analysts to go along with an overly optimistic view of the
future, setting investors up for a disappointment. 
That’s where the earnings whisper number comes in. The whisper number, in
theory, is the unofficial earnings number most investors honestly expect the
company to report. 
Whisper numbers gain even more prominence during strong bull markets when
investors’ expectations begin to soar. For instance, in April 2000, Yahoo!’s stock
fell 9% in the two trading days after reporting a profit of 10 cents a share, which
topped official earnings estimates, but missed the whisper by 2 cents a share. 
You can get whisper numbers for free online. WhisperNumber.com (www.
whispernumber.com) is an easy way to see what the whisper number might
be. Just enter the symbol of the stock you’re interested in, click the Get It!
button, and you can view the whisper number for the current quarter. (See
Figure 15-2.)You can also look up the whisper number for the previous quarter
and see how close it was to the actual number reported by the company.
Lastly, you can see how the stock reacted in 1, 5, 10, and 30 days following the
company’s last earnings announcement. The site is free, but you must register.

Accessing and understanding 
credit ratings
Research analysts who study companies and their stocks get the most atten-
tion from many investors. But there’s a second type of company analysts out
there — debt-rating analysts or bond analysts. Debt-rating analysts study
companies to determine how creditworthy they are. Debt-rating analysts are
important because if they determine a company is stable and trustworthy,
the company can borrow money at lower interest rates. Debt-rating analysts
give companies letter grades to measure their financial strength, with A being
high and either C or D being the lowest grade possible. 
Credit and Finance Risk Analysis (www.credfinrisk.com/ratings.html)
provides a handy definition of the ratings and what they mean. 
There are three major debt-rating firms, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and
Fitch. The ratings used by Moody’s vary slightly from the ratings used by the
other two firms. The debt-rating firms employ armies of analysts trained to
pick apart company’s financial statements looking for trouble. While they
miss problems from time to time, they’re still a helpful source of information
for investors.

Even if you’re buying a company’s stock, not its debt, credit agencies’ ratings
are very important because they give you an idea of how solid the company’s
financials are. There are three leading credit agencies, but only the following
two agencies make their ratings available for free online: 
 Moody’s Investors Service: (www.moodys.com) Moody’s provides easy
online access to its credit ratings. Just enter the company’s symbol or
name in the Search For field and click Go. (See Figure 15-3.) Scroll down
until you see the company’s name and put your cursor over the gold
icon, and Moody’s ratings for the company pop up. You might see sev-
eral ratings for each company, but the rating of most importance to
investors is the one called Senior Unsecured. Moody’s site is free, but
you must register to get any information from it.
 Standard & Poor’s: (www.standardandpoors.com) S&P lets you view
its credit ratings for the thousands of stocks it covers. Click the Ratings
link near the center of its home page and then click the Credit Ratings
Search link on the left side of the new page that appears. After the page
refreshes, enter the company’s name in the Keyword field and scroll
down until you see the company’s name. After you click the company’s
name, you see S&P’s credit rating for the company. The site is free, but
you have to register to use it.

Connecting with Online Stock Ratings
Wall Street analysts aren’t the only sources for ratings on stocks. There’s 
a handful of online stock rating services that either let a computer or other
investors rate a stock. Some of these rating services are based on computer
models, sometimes called quantitative (or quant) models, which analyze com-
panies’ financial statements and key ratios to decide whether the stock is a
good buy. Other stock rating services allow investors to share their ratings
on stocks, with the idea that as a whole the average of the crowd’s opinions
will be close to accurate. I cover both types of stock rating services in the 
following sections.
Putting quant stock models 
to work for you
Research reports issued by Wall Street analysts and debt-rating analysts can
be helpful, but they’re not perfect. These analysts are human, too, and often
fail to sound the bell before financial catastrophes occur — think the collapse
of dot-com stocks as well as the implosion of Enron and companies in the 
sub-prime mortgage industry. These missteps by human analysts have led
some investors to think that it would be great if you could get ratings and rec-
ommendations on stocks yet somehow eliminate the potential of human error
or lapses in judgment. That’s where quant models come in. These models are
programmed by market experts to analyze stocks by using a series of criteria
and to rate them. Most of these systems are untouched by human hands after
they’re designed. Instead, they follow very strict preset guidelines. A few
online quant models include the following:
 Schwab Equity Ratings:
(www.schwab.wallst.com/ser/perfMonitor/public/?period=
52wk) Schwab ranks thousands of stocks (using an A through F scale)
based on company’s valuations plus the risk, valuation, and momentum
of their stocks. Even if you’re not a Schwab customer, you can get limited
access to the Schwab Equity Ratings. 
For instance, say you’d like to get a list of all the stocks that have been
rated an A. Start out by making sure the Performance Over Recent 26-51
Weeks tab is selected, as shown in Figure 15-4, and then choose the most
recent period from the Select Performance Time Period drop-down list.
You see a table underneath a few charts. In this table, you can click the
time period, listed under the Performance for the Period header, and get a
list of all the stocks that were rated A, and also B through F, 26 weeks ago. 
326
Part III: Maximizing Invvestment Knowledge 

You need to be a Schwab customer to get access to current Schwab
Equity Ratings for all stocks. 
 MSN Money’s StockScouter: (http://moneycentral.msn.com/
investor/StockRating/srsmain.asp) Yet another online tool from
MSN Money, the StockScouter first evaluates a stock’s potential risk and
return and then assigns a rating between one, as unattractive, to 10, which
means attractive. The rating is based on dozens of variables, ranging from
the stock’s P-E to analysts’ opinions on the stock. Just enter the stock’s
symbol into the Name or Symbol(s) field and click Go, and MSN Money
spits out the rating.
 USATODAY.com’s Stock Meter: (http://money.usatoday.com) The
Stock Meter ranks stocks on a scale of one to five, with one being the
most conservative to five being the more aggressive, based on an analy-
sis of many of the important things highlighted in Chapter 13 including
return on equity, liquidity, debt load, dividend record, and volatility. You
can get ratings on stocks by entering their symbol in the Get a Quote
blank on the left side of the page and clicking the Go button (you may
have to scroll down a bit to see the Get a quote blank). A new page will
come up showing the stock’s Stock Meter score on the right side.

Sharing stock ratings with 
other investors online
In his book The Wisdom of Crowds, journalist James Surowiecki argues that 
a crowd of regular people making decisions, on average, will get closer to 
the right answer as a whole than just a few experts. Collectively, a group of
diverse and independent-thinking people will, on average, come up with an
accurate guess. 
Several online sites are trying to harness this wisdom of crowds and turn the
masses’ guess into information you can use to boost your returns. Some good
sources for this collective intelligence are listed here: 
 The Motley Fool CAPS: (caps.fool.com) This particular corner of the
Motley Fool Web site allows members to enter their ratings on thousands
of stocks. The ratings are then compiled into a single average rating that’s
available to all users of the Web site. Just enter a stock’s symbol into the
search field and click Go, and you see how other CAPS users rate the
stock, based on a star rating. A stock with five stars is a strong buy, and 
a stock with a one-star rating is a strong sell. 
But CAPS gets more interesting the more you dive into the menus. For
instance, you can read why certain CAPS members rated a stock the way
they did. And even these blurbs are rated by members, so you can read
the most highly rated comments on a stock. And if you click the CAPS
Rating tab in the Stock Trends chart, you can see how the CAPS rating has
changed over the past few months. Anyone can view most CAPS ratings
and information. but to rate stocks yourself, you’ll need to register with
the site, which is free. 
And what does CAPS stand for? You’re going to be sorry you asked. CAPS
doesn’t appear to stand for anything, but rather seems to be a play on
the word cap, since the Motley Fool’s founders are known for wearing
jester hats. Participants in the CAPS system are assigned a color-coded
hat, or cap, icon to signal how good they have been at picking stocks. 
 Stockpickr: (www.stockpickr.com) This site allows you to enter your
portfolio and the system looks for other investors with similar portfolios.
Stockpickr then recommends stocks that commonly appear in these 
similar portfolios. The Stockpickr system figures that you might want to
check out the stocks similar investors own. You must register for a free
username and password to use the site.
 Consensus View: (www.consensusview.com) At Consensus View, 
you get to rate just about every stock, foreign market, or investment you
can think of as bullish or bearish. All the users’ predictions are compiled
and averaged, and you can see what other members think and how their
opinions have changed over the months. You must sign up for a free
membership to use the site.
328
Part III: Maximizing Invvestment Knowledge 

 SocialPicks: (www.socialpicks.com) This site tracks stocks that are
getting the most ratings from members of the site and features them on
the front page so you can quickly see what the site’s members are talking
about online. The site also tracks and ranks investment pros and stock-
picking bloggers by giving them a SocialPicks Rank. The SocialPicks Rank
quickly shows you whose stock recommendations are most valued. You
can use the site to find out which users are the best overall experts and
see their ratings on various stocks. You must sign up for a free registration
to use the site.
 PredictWallStreet: (www.predictwallstreet.com) PredictWallStreet
lets you start sharing recommendations with others pretty quickly and
easily. From the front page, just enter a stock symbol into the search field
and click the Up button if you recommend the stock and the Down button
if you think the stock will fall. You can see the average recommendations
of other users for other popular stock market indexes or popular stocks.
One of the nice things about this site is that you can use it without 
registering. 
Following the crowd when it comes to investing can often be a bad idea.
During periods of market manias, when investors become overly bullish
about particular types of stocks, they often bid stock prices up too high
and set themselves up for disappointments. Some investors, who call
themselves contrarians, instead figure out what the crowd is doing and
then do the opposite. If the crowd is bullish about a stock, a contrarian
would assume the group is wrong and be bearish about the stock.

Evaluating Stock and Mutual Fund
Picking Newsletters and Web Sites
Whenever a crowd is trying to make quick money, there’s no shortage of
people happy to offer their expertise and skill . . . for a fee. Stock investing is 
no different. You can find dozens of stock and mutual fund picking newsletters,
Web sites, books, and seminars. They all make great pitches for why you need
to pay to subscribe to their wonderful services.
By and large, many of the pitches you see for stock-picking newsletters 
aren’t worth much, and you should be very skeptical before paying money 
for “systems” and “programs” that claim to be able to beat the market. A 1998
study by Jeffrey Jaffe and James Mahoney — available at http://papers.
ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=937407 — found that stocks 
recommended by newsletters don’t outperform the market. The study also
found that newsletters tend to pile onto yesterday’s winning stocks by 
recommending stocks that had done well in the recent past. 
329
Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers

Before you sign up for a stock 
picking service . . . 
Before you pay a dime for any stock-picking newsletter or Web site, take 
the time to educate yourself about the specific service you’re considering. 
Your first stop should be a column written by Mark Hulbert (www.
marketwatch.com/news/newsletters). Hulbert is a well-known tracker 
of newsletter performance. Hulbert uses advanced performance-tracking 
methods to measure not only how well stock-picking newsletters perform, 
but also how much risk they’ve taken to get those returns. After all, a 30%
annual return isn’t that impressive if your portfolio swings up and down 
80% a year. 
Hulbert writes a number of financial columns at MarketWatch that are worth
reading because he tells you about trends among stock pickers. If you want to
look up how a specific newsletter scores in Hulbert’s ratings, you need to sign
up for his Hulbert Interactive service, which ranks more than 180 newsletters.
(You can sign up at www3.marketwatch.com/Store/products/hulbert_
interactive.aspx?.)The service costs $150 a year, but you can buy a 
one-day pass for $9. 
If a newsletter or online stock-picking service you’re considering isn’t tracked
by Hulbert, you should be skeptical. It might mean the service doesn’t want
its performance to be tracked — perhaps for shady reasons.
You can also view some of Hulbert’s research by clicking the Free Sample
Issue button at the bottom of any of his columns at MarketWatch. The sample
issue is a few months old, but it still contains information about newsletter
rankings. Hulbert’s data show how few newsletters actually beat the market
on a risk-adjusted basis. For instance, during the 25 year period ending in
February 2007, only two newsletters tracked by Hulbert beat the market. 
And you can be sure the other 23 still collected the subscription fees.
Using newsletters to your advantage
You might be wondering whether stock-picking newsletters are often so
wrong, how can they help you? Again, the contrarian approach might make
sense, and it’s a strategy used by many professional money managers. 
The simplest way to see what newsletters are saying about stocks and doing
the opposite is by determining how many newsletter writers are bullish and
how many are bearish. When newsletter writers are nervous about the market
and selling stocks, that’s a signal to contrarian investors that now is a good
time to buy stocks. And when newsletter writers are bullish and buying stocks,
these contrarian investors start to take money off the table by selling stocks.

Schaeffer’s Investment Research (www.schaeffersresearch.com) provides
some of the information you need to be a contrarian. Click the Market Tools
link on the Quotes & Tools tab and then click the Investor’s Intelligence link 
on the new page that appears. Doing so brings up the Investor’s Intelligence’s
newsletter indicator in both tabular and chart form, which tells you what 
percentage of newsletters are bullish and what percentage are bearish. 
331
Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers
Don’t let reading newsletters 
bring on a junk-mail deluge 
One potential peril of signing up for stock-picking
services and newsletters is that some sell your
name and address to other companies for profit.
This might fill your mailbox with ads you don’t want,
including pitches for shady penny stock shams. 
Here are two strategies to prevent you from 
getting slammed from junk mail:
 Use a slightly different name when you sign up
for the stock-picking service. Instead of signing
up as Joe Smith, use JoeD Smith or something
like that. If junk mail starts showing up to that
unique name, you’ll know it’s the stock-picking
service that’s selling your information. You can
call the service up and tell them to stop.
 Sign up for the Direct Marketing Association’s
Mail 
Preference 
Service 
(www.dma
consumers.org/consumerassis
tance.html). This service helps you take
your name off of many lists used by compa-
nies to send out advertising and promotion
material. You can fill out the form online

onds don’t make very good cocktail party chatter. Just try to brag about
your 5%-a-year bond return at a party. The only heads you’ll turn will 
be the ones running away from you yawning. Bonds just aren’t as exciting or
glamorous as stocks, which can often gain more value in an hour than you’ll
collect from bonds all year. 
But don’t let the fact bonds are, well, often boring discourage you from owning
them. Bonds, often called fixed-income securities, are essentially IOUs issued by
companies, cities, governments, and government agencies. These IOUs come
with a promise to repay the lender by a specific time at a specific interest rate.
These stable streams of cash flow can be very valuable if you choose bonds
wisely. Bonds can help smooth out the ups and downs in your portfolio and
help you reach your financial goals. 
In this chapter, I explain what a bond is and how it differs from other invest-
ments, including stocks. I also show you ways to find out more about bonds
and get up with the terms and lingo. You get a chance to discover Web sites
that let you research bonds to find the ones that might fit your portfolio the
best. And I show you ways to buy bonds online as well as a few alternatives
to bonds you might consider. 

Getting Acquainted with Bonds
If you’ve ever lent money to someone and set up a repayment program, you
already know what a bond is. A bond is an IOU that entitles you to a stream of
payments from the borrower. Companies, governments, cities, and government
agencies often sell bonds so they can raise money to build facilities, build
bridges, or finance their operations. The money that was borrowed must be
repaid at a predetermined interest rate and by a set period of time in the future
(called the maturity date) along with the money borrowed (called the principal).
Bonds by their nature offer investors several benefits:
 Generally stable and predictable cash payments: Investors who aren’t
looking for any big surprises tend to appreciate bonds’ preset rate of
return. When you buy a bond and hold it until maturity, you know ahead
of time what your return will be. This can be useful for reaching financial
obligations.
 Repayment of principal: When you buy a bond, you’ll receive interest
payments in addition to the money you loaned back, as long as the bor-
rower can afford the payments and doesn’t default. Investors who want
to preserve their initial investment like bonds for this very reason. 
 Liquidity: You might be familiar with bank certificates of deposit (CDs),
which also pay interests and return the original investments. But unlike
most CDs, which you must hold for a set period of time or pay a penalty,
you can sell your bonds to other investors, in most cases, at any time
just like you’d sell a stock. This characteristic of bonds means you can
raise cash if you need to.
You have two ways to make money from a bond. You can hold it until 
it comes due, or matures. That way, you collect the interest as it’s paid.
Your other option is to sell the bond to someone else before it matures.
Just remember, though, when you sell a bond you might not get back
what you paid. The bond’s price might fall if the bond because less
desirable for reasons discussed later in the chapter. 
 Diversification: Bond prices tend to move up and down in a different
pattern than stocks price. By owning stocks and bonds, you can smooth
out the bumps in your portfolio. Table 16-1 shows you how bonds might
not go up as much as stocks, but they don’t usually fall as much either.

Typically, investors who need a more stable portfolio place most of their
investments in bonds. But even if you’re terrified of the thought of losing
money, it’s usually not a good idea to put your entire portfolio in bonds.
Mixing some stocks in your portfolio can reduce your risk and increase your
returns because bonds and stocks usually don’t rise and fall at the same time
by the same degree.
Knowing who issues debt
Before you can buy or sell bonds, you must understand there are several types
of bonds, based on who sold them. Each type of bond has unique traits and
can be bought or sold online differently. The following is a quick rundown of
the major issuers of bonds: 
 U.S. government: Debt instruments sold by the U.S. government are
popular because they’re backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.,
which stands behind these loans and promises that they’ll be repaid.
That greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the risk you won’t get paid. These
fixed-income securities are often called Treasuries, and come in three
main varieties: Treasury bills mature in one year or less, treasury notes
mature in more than a year up to 10 years and treasury bonds mature 
in more than 10 years. TreasuryDirect (www.treasurydirect.gov)
provides in-depth information about Treasuries.
Even if you’re not interested in buying bonds, the yield on Treasuries 
is a very important figure to keep in mind. Treasury yields tell you how
much return you can get for taking little to no risk. If a risk-free Treasury
pays 5%, you probably wouldn’t be willing to buy a risky stock unless it
would return considerably more than 5%. 
Treasuries are often called risk-free investments, but that’s not really
true. Even Treasuries face interest-rate risk. Say you buy a Treasury that
pays 5% interest. If inflation rises, and interest rates rise to 6% as a
result, your 5% interest rate isn’t looking so hot anymore. If you sell the
bond, you’ll get less for it than you paid. And if you hold onto the bond,
your 5% interest rate is lackluster.
 Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises:
Individual government agencies can also borrow money. Debt issued by
335
Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online

agencies is still considered safe, while perhaps not as safe as Treasuries.
That means agency bonds may pay slightly higher interest rates than
Treasuries. Some examples of agency bonds include those sold by 
the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae (www.
ginniemae.gov), to provide financing to low and moderate-income
families to buy homes. Ginnie Mae loans are backed by several govern-
ment agencies. Similarly, there are lenders called government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) that, although closely tied to the government and
often created by Congress, are private companies and are therefore not
technically agencies. 
The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae (www.
fanniemae.com), is a GSE that buys and sells mortgage-backed securi-
ties that pass interest and principal payments made by homeowners to
investors who own the securities. 
Fannie Mae, as a private company sponsored by the Federal government,
has stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Federal government
has determined that Fannie Mae must help provide money to the mort-
gage industry and provides it with help and supervision. But the govern-
ment doesn’t legally stand behind Fannie Mae’s bonds. Most investors,
though, believe the government would step in and intervene before a GSE
like Fannie Mae was unable to pay its debts. 
 Companies: Bonds issued by companies, sometimes called corporates,
allow them to pay for equipment and services they need in order to
expand or grow. Companies pay higher interest rates than the govern-
ment because there’s a larger chance they will default, or hit hard times
and have trouble paying the money they borrowed back. Bonds sold by
rock-solid companies are called investment grade. Small companies or
companies with shaky finances issue what’s called high-yield or junk-
bond debt. Investment grade bonds pay lower interest rates than junk
bonds because investors are more certain they’ll get their money back. 
 Cities and municipalities: Cities may borrow money by selling bonds,
called municipal bonds or just munis. The biggest attraction of munis to
investors is the fact that their interest often isn’t taxable by the federal
government. And if you buy a muni bond issued by a government in the
state or city you live in, the interest might also not be subject to state or
city tax. Munis are often called tax-exempt bonds for this reason. There’s a
price of this tax benefit, though. Munis might pay lower interest rates than
bonds with similar risk. InvestorGuide.com (www.investorguide.com/
igu-article-575-bonds-municipal-bonds.html) provides more
information about munis.
Don’t just look at the seemingly low interest rate offered by a tax-exempt
muni bond when deciding if you want to buy it. The actual interest rate is
higher after you factor in the fact that the interest payments often aren’t 
taxable. For example, if an investor in the 28% tax bracket buys a muni bond
paying 5% interest, that’s equivalent to a 6.94% interest rate from a taxable
bond. And that’s a good thing. One other thing to remember: Not all muni
bonds qualify for the tax breaks so be sure to check before you buy one.

Want to compare the interest rate on a tax-exempt muni bond with a 
taxable bond? The Investing in Bonds Web site provides a table that 
converts tax-exempt interest rates to taxable rates for different tax
brackets at (www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=
5&subcatid=24&id=206). And Smith Barney (www.smithbarney.
com/cgi-bin/bonds/teymey.cgi) offers a free calculator that tells
you what a taxable bond’s interest rate would need to be to match the
interest rate paid on a muni bond.
Online resources to find 
out more about bonds
One of the toughest things about bonds is just figuring out the vocabulary.
Investors who focus on buying and selling stocks often struggle with the 
different terms when they enter the brave new world of bonds. It’s critical,
though, for you to understand the lexicon of bonds before jumping in. Several
Web sites, though, step you through the bond world and can get you up to
speed in no time. Here’s the (relatively) short list:
 Investopedia’s Bond Basics: (www.investopedia.com/university/
bonds) This corner of Investopedia runs through everything you need
to know to get started with bonds. The site covers the terminology and
shows you how to calculate how much bonds are worth. 
 SmartMoney Economy & Bonds: (www.smartmoney.com/bonds)
SmartMoney’s Bonds section contains useful tools and information for
bond investors. You can find news stories that update investors with
developments in the bond markets as well as the Bonds Toolbox, which
offers several useful calculators, including one that measures how much
it would cost you to sell one bond to buy another.

Investing in “Bowie” bonds
Bonds are usually sold by governments and
companies, but some interesting exceptions
have cropped up. One of the more famous and
unorthodox sellers of bonds was rock star David
Bowie. Bowie generated $55 million for himself
in 1997 by selling “Bowie Bonds.” Investors who
bought the bonds were entitled to the cash
stream generated by sales of Bowie’s albums for
a decade. Similar music-based bonds followed,
allowing investors to buy the cash streams from
James Brown and the Isley Brothers. Individual
investors were unable to invest in Bowie Bonds.
The Bowie Bond was the innovation of the
Pullman Group (www.pullmanco.com). The
future of music-based bonds is uncertain as
more consumers buy individual music tracks
from online music stores, rather than full-length
albums from music retailers.

 Briefing.com: (http://briefing.com/Investor/Public/

com to have a Bonds section, and you’d be right. It provide updates
during the day on the direction of the bond market and also summarizes
news that is affecting bond prices. 
Common traits of bonds
Bond investors have their own language — and InvestinginBonds.com
(www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=46&id=7) pro-
vides a comprehensive glossary of terms. But before you get overwhelmed by
all the terms, the following list offers a quick description of the most important
ones you need to know. Nearly all bonds have the following characteristics:
 Face (or par) value: The face value is the amount of money you’ll get
back when the bond matures. For many bonds, the face value is the 
principal, or amount that you’ve lent. The face value is also sometimes
called the principal.
 Interest rate: The interest rate measures how much you’ll receive as a
payment in exchange for lending the money. Generally, the interest rate
is a percentage of the money lent, known as the face value of the bond.
Interest, often called the coupon rate, is often paid twice a year. 
Example: If you bought a $1,000 bond that pays 5% interest, you would
be paid $50 a year in interest or $25 twice a year. You would get your
$1,000 back when the bond matured. 
Interest rates can be fixed, meaning the same rate of interest is paid to
the investor for the life of the bond. Interest rates can also be floating
and move up or down based on the direction of interest rates paid by
Treasuries. Some bonds don’t pay interest until the bond matures.
These bonds, called zero-coupon bonds, are bought for less than their
face value. Instead of receiving an interest payment twice a year as with
many bonds, a zero-coupon bond pays nothing until it matures. When
the zero-coupon bond matures, the investor receives the face value,
which includes the interest.
Another example: Imagine an investor who pays $600 for a zero-coupon
bond that matures in ten years, when it will pay $1,000. At the end of the
ten years, the investor gets his $600 principal back plus $400. That $400
is the interest, which in this case amounts to an interest rate of more
than 5% a year. 
 Maturity: A bond’s maturity is the date by which it must be paid off.
Debt maturities can range from days to 20 or more years. A fixed-income
security’s maturity is very important and determines what it’s called.
Table 16-2 shows you what different fixed-income securities (excluding
Treasuries, which have their own naming convention, as explained
above) are called based on their maturities.

 Special provisions: Bonds can be customized by the borrowers and con-
tain unique privileges for either the seller or the buyer of the bonds. A Call
provision is especially important if you’re interested in buying bonds. If a
bond can be called, that means the borrower can repay the loan before
the maturity date. You can expect a bond to be called if current interest
rates fall below the interest rate on the bond. If you’re collecting a fat 7%
interest rate on a bond, and interest rates fall to 5% for similar bonds, the
issuer will likely call the bond and end your gravy train. Similarly, some
bonds have Put provisions, which allow the bond buyers to force the
bond seller to buy the bond back before the maturity date. 
 Price: You can buy bonds directly from the issuers, and when you do, 
you often pay the face value. But, you can also buy bonds from previous
owners in the secondary market, and when you do, you’ll pay the current
price. A bond’s price is determined by many variables, such as the current
interest rates on similar bonds.

Understanding the yield curve
Anytime you read about or investigate bonds,
you’ll inevitably hear someone mention the yield
curve. The yield curve is a chart that shows you
how yields on short-term fixed-income securi-
ties (with maturities of three months or less)
compare with long-term bonds (with maturi-
ties of 30 years or so). The Investing in Bonds 
site (http://investinginbonds.com/
learnmore.asp?catid=46&id=8) de-
scribes the yield curve. But I step you through
the basics here. Generally, yield curves come in
four shapes:
 Normal: Most of the time, investors demand
higher interest rates on long-term bonds
than they do on short-term notes. That’s nat-
ural. If you let someone borrow money for 30
years, you’ll want more interest because
there’s a greater chance you’ll never see
your money again. That’s why yields (most
of the time) will be at their lowest point for
the short-term fixed income securities and
gradually move higher. 
 Steep: Most of the time, investors demand
two or more percentage points in extra yield
when lending money for 30 years compared

with loaning money for a short time. If the
interest rate on a three-month note is 4%,
investors will demand 6% or higher on a
comparable long-term bond in normal times.
But, if the difference between the short-
term and long-term rates gets even wider,
that creates a steep yield curve. A steep
yield curve often indicates investors expect
economic growth to speed up.
 Inverted: When investors are willing to lend
money for the long term and accept lower
interest rates than they’d take for a short-
term loan, the yield curve is inverted.
Inverted yield curves can indicate that
investors are worried the economy is about
to slow down for a prolonged period of time.
If the economy slows down, interest rates in
the future might also fall. That means
investors want to lock in current interest
rates for the long term before they decline. 
 Flat: When the interest rates on short-term
loans equal long-term rates, you have a flat
yield curve. A flat yield curve indicates
investors aren’t all too sure about where the
economy is headed. 
SmartMoney’s Living Yield Curve feature helps
explain this critical element of bond investing.
The Living Yield Curve lets you see how the
yields on bonds of different maturities compare
to each other and how they’ve changed over
time. The Living Yield Curve graphically shows
you how the yields compare and lets you watch
them change by watching a movie. To see how
it looks, go to www.smartmoney.com/
bonds and click the Living Yield Curve link in
the Bonds Toolbox section. In the new page that
appears, just click on the Play button under the
Charting the Curve box (see the following figure)
and you can see the yield curve change. 
341
Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online

When a bond’s price is less than its face value, it’s said to trade at a 
discount. Bonds trade at a discount when interest rates rise (say, to 6%),
making the bond’s interest rate (say, just 5%) less attractive. When a
bond’s price is greater than its face value, it’s said to trade at a premium.
This happens when interest rates fall (perhaps to 4%), making this bond’s
interest rate (still at 5%) look more attractive and the bond worth more.
 Credit ratings: When you buy a bond from a company, one of the biggest
dangers you face is the chance the company won’t be able to pay you
back, or default. Debt-rating agencies study companies’ financial state-
ments and rate them based on their ability to pay. The shakier the com-
pany, the more it will need to pay in interest to attract investors. Debt
ratings are discussed more fully in Chapter 14, including instruction 
on how to access them. The three main debt-rating agencies, Moody’s
Investors Service (www.moodys.com), Standard & Poor’s (www.sandp.
com), and Fitch Ratings (www.fitchratings.com) provide more details
about their ratings online. 
 Current yield: The current yield tells you how much interest you’ll
receive from the bond based on the bond’s price. You can calculate 
a bond’s current yield by dividing the annual interest payment by the
purchase price. 
Example: You paid $900 for a bond with a $1,000 face value that pays 5%,
or $50 a year, in interest. The current yield is 5.6%, which is calculated
by dividing $50 by $900 and multiplying by 100 to convert the answer
into a percentage.
 Yield to maturity: Tells you how much interest you’ll gain as a percentage
of the price you paid for the bond if you hold the bond until it matures.
Yield to maturity is one of the best ways to measure the true return of 
a bond. 
Money Chimp’s online Bond Yield calculator (www.moneychimp.com/
calculator/popup/calculator.htm?mode=calc_bondytm) can
calculate a bond’s current yield and yield to maturity for you. You need
to enter the bond’s current price, face value, coupon rate, and years to
maturity. 
Remember that bond prices fall when yields rise, almost like a teeter
totter. Many beginning investors get hung up on this concept. Just think 
of it this way: If you own bond that yields 5%, but yields on similar bonds
rise to 6%, your 5% looks pretty paltry. If you tried to sell your bond, you’d
have to cut the price to find a buyer. If someone tells you bonds are down,
make sure you know if they’re talking about bond yields or bond prices. 
 Duration: A bond’s duration measures the time it takes, on average, for
the bond buyer to get their money back. Duration differs from maturity
in that it counts the interest payments made before the bond comes
due. Duration is very handy because it can help you compare different
bonds and determine which ones are more volatile. The larger the dura-
tion, the longer it takes for investors to get their money back, which
342
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

makes them more volatile. Investopedia’s Bond Duration calculator
(www.investopedia.com/calculator/BondDurCDate.aspx) will
tell you a bond’s duration if you enter the bond’s details, including 
face value, yield to maturity, interest rate, current maturity, and the
schedule for payments.
How to Find and Buy Bonds Online
Just as with stocks, there’s no one way to buy bonds. You can buy individual
bonds using a mainstream online broker, you can buy directly from the bor-
rowers, or you can deal directly with brokers that specialize in bonds. But you
can also buy bonds through a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. In the 
following sections, I show you how to buy bonds using these major methods. 
Finding individual bonds online
Finding and buying an individual bond is very similar to finding and buying
an individual stock. It’s up to you to find the bonds that have what you’re
looking for in terms of risk and reward. 
Online tools can help you find bonds that fit your needs. You can use various
bond screening tools, which let you define characteristics of a bond you’d like
to find. The bond screener then cross-checks what you’re looking for in a
bond against its database of available bonds. A few bond screeners that can
help you quickly find bonds you’re interested in include the following:
 Yahoo! Finance’s Bond Screener: (http://screen.yahoo.com/
bonds.html) Yahoo!’s bond screener first asks you whether you’re
interested in buying a Treasury, a zero-coupon Treasury, a corporate
security, or a municipal security. (If you’re looking for a muni bond, you
can also indicate what state you’re interested in.) You can narrow your
search by other factors, ranging from the bond’s price, coupon, yield to
maturity, and credit rating. After you enter what you’re looking for, click
the Find Bonds button to get a list of all the bonds that meet your stan-
dards. Click a bond and write down the name of the issuer, coupon, and
maturity date. You need this information to buy the bond. 
 Zions Direct’s Bond Center: (www.zionsbank.com/zd_bonds_about-
guest.jsp) The Zions Direct site provides a full-fledged screener that
lets you be even more specific about what you’re looking for in a bond.
You can filter not only on muni bonds and Treasuries, but also on high-
yield, investment-grade, and agency bonds. Just click the button for the
type of bond you’re interested in, wait for a page similar to what you see
in Figure 16-2 to appear, and then enter all your search criteria into the
343
Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online

appropriate text fields. When you’re done, click the Search button, and
you see the list of bonds that make your cut. Write down the name of the
issuer, coupon, and maturity date. 
 Online brokers’ sites: Most of the large online brokers mentioned in
Chapter 4 — including Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E*Trade —
all provide bond screening tools on their sites. Check with your online
broker to see whether it has a feature that lets you screen for fixed-
income securities.
Bond screeners tell you what the all-important yield to maturity of a bond is.
This is a great tip because it saves you and your calculator the hassle of mea-
suring the yield to maturity yourself. 
Sealing the deal: Buying 
individual bonds online
After you’ve found the perfect individual bond for you, you need to know
how to buy it. You can buy bonds in several ways:

 Buying straight from the government: If you’re interested in buying
Treasuries, you can cut out the middleman and buy directly from the
U.S. Treasury at TreasuryDirect (www.treasurydirect.gov).
TreasuryDirect lets you buy
• Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.
• Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPs): TIPs are unique
securities that pay you more interest and principal if interest rates
rise. 
• Savings bonds: These bonds, designed for individuals, don’t pay 
very high interest rates and aren’t appropriate for investors looking
for the best returns. But savings bonds might have some tax advan-
tages, are backed by the government, and pay predictable interest.
TreasuryDirect’s Tax Advantage Calculator (www.treasury
direct.gov/BC/SBCTax) can help you measure whether you 
can get a tax benefit from owning savings bonds. The Savings Bond
Calculator (www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_
savingsbondcalc.htm) can help you decide whether savings
bonds are right for you.
Buying Treasuries from the government is a good option because 
there’s no fee for most investors. You also don’t have to invest much.
The minimum investment is just $1,000 for Treasuries and TIPs and $25
for savings bonds. Not sure how to use TreasuryDirect? TreasuryDirect’s
Guided Tour (www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/TDTour/default.
htm) steps you through the specific process of buying bonds through
the site. The Federal Reserve Bank (www.federalreserve.gov/
generalinfo/faq/faqts.htm), the U.S.’s central bank, also provides
instructions on how to buy Treasuries.
 Buying from a mainstream online broker: Several of the bigger online
brokerage firms, (including Charles Schwab, E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, 
and Scottrade) also let you buy and sell bonds. But remember that the
stock-trading commissions don’t apply, and the bond commission can
vary wildly depending on the broker and what kind of bond you’re buying. 
Schwab has one of the more straightforward fee structures for bonds.
You can buy Treasuries online for no commission and most other types
of bonds — including agencies and corporate bonds — for $1 per bond. 
Some brokers charge so-called mark-up fees for bonds. Mark-up fees are
added to the price of the bond. For instance, you might buy a bond for
$1,000 but later see that you actually paid $1,045, where $1,000 is the
price of the bond and $45 is the mark-up. There’s nothing illegal about
mark-up fees, and they’ve been a common way for brokers to charge
commissions for buying bonds. You just want to find out ahead of time
how much the mark-up fee will be and confirm you weren’t overcharged
by reviewing the confirmation of your order.
345
Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online

Some brokers charge commissions when you buy Treasuries. E*Trade,
for instance, charges $40. You should think long and hard before paying
any commissions or fees to buy Treasuries because you can buy them
for free and online from TreasuryDirect.
 Buying with the help of a bond broker: Some brokers specialize in just
bond trading. Zions Direct and JW Korth (www.shop4bonds.com) are
two examples. FMSbonds.com (www.fmsbonds.com) specializes in
munis, whereas Tradebonds.com (http://tradebonds.com) is geared
mainly for large investors, but anyone who registers can use the site to
get prices for bonds. 
 Buying via a bond mutual fund: Buying individual bonds can be some-
what complex. You need to understand yields, prices, duration, and
other cryptic measures of value. And that doesn’t even scratch some
advanced bond techniques, such as laddering.
Laddering is a technique used to lower your risk when investing in
bonds. When you ladder, you buy bonds that expire at different times,
say at one year, two years, and ten years. That way, if you buy bonds and
interest rates rise, when your one-year bonds mature, you can reinvest
the proceeds at the higher interest rate. Fidelity (http://personal.
fidelity.com/products/fixedincome/ladders.shtml) provides
a helpful description of what laddering is and how it can help you. 
You can ladder and diversify your own bond portfolio. But for many
investors, it’s easier to just buy a bond mutual fund that does it for you.
With a bond mutual fund, the laddering and diversification is taken care
of for you. Just as with stock mutual funds, you can buy actively man-
aged bond funds run by portfolio managers who try to beat the market
or passive index bond funds. 
You can find bond funds with the mutual fund–screening tools discussed
in Chapter 10, but a good bet here would be the Vanguard Total Bond
Market index. The fund owns a smattering of government, corporate,
agency, and other bonds and charges a reasonable 0.2% annual expense
ratio. If you’re looking for an easy way to add bonds to your portfolio,
this might be a good choice.
Think twice before buying a long-term government bond mutual fund.
You’ll pay an annual fee for the mutual fund, sometimes 1% a year. That’s
probably not a good idea considering you can buy Treasuries for free
from TreasuryDirect.
 Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Another option for buying bonds is
through exchange-traded funds. ETFs, explained in depth in Chapter 11,
are baskets of investments that trade like stocks. A bond ETF is ideal for
investors who primarily buy stocks but want to easily add bonds to their
portfolio and keep fees down. These ETFs track bond indexes, such as
the Lehman Aggregate Bond index, which tracks a broad basket of bonds.
Buying a bond ETF is the bond version of investing in a stock index like
the Standard & Poor’s 500. 
346
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 

It’s easy to get started. Just pick the bond ETF you want and buy it
through your online broker just as you’d buy a stock. You can read how
to buy and sell stocks in Chapter 5. Note as well that you can find bond
ETFs using the ETF-screening tools discussed in Chapter 11. (3 ETFs you
may want to check out are iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond [AGG], SPDR
Lehman Aggregate Bond [LAG], and Vanguard Total Bond Market [BND].
All three are diversified and have low fees.)
Considering Bond Alternatives
The relative safety of bonds as well as their lower volatility make them well
suited for many investors’ portfolios. But don’t make the mistake of thinking
bonds are without risks. The Investing in Bonds site (www.investingin
bonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&id=383) describes the risks of
bonds in detail. But these are the risks you should be most aware:
 Default risk: Unless you’re buying Treasuries, you’re taking a chance the
borrower won’t pay you back.
 Market risk: If bonds go out of favor because investors are seeking
higher returns, the price of your bonds might decline. 
 Liquidity risk: From time to time, investors get nervous about the econ-
omy or about bonds, and they simply refuse to buy bonds. This is gener-
ally more of a problem with unusual or rare bonds, and it isn’t a worry
with Treasuries or investment grade bonds. 
 Interest rate risk: The threat of higher interest rates is one of the
biggest risks you face when you buy a bond. If rates rise, the interest
rate you locked in suddenly isn’t so lucrative, which decreases the value
of your bond.
Some investors have an aversion to bonds for these reasons and others.
These investors don’t like the fact that bond values can fall, because bonds
are supposed to be safer investments. If you’re a bond hater, keep reading.
The rest of this section explores a few bond alternatives. 
Money market funds and 
certificates of deposit
If you’re looking for safe investments but want to get more interest than
you’re getting in a bank savings account, you might consider money market
funds or certificates of deposit. 
347
Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online

 Money market funds are a great place to park money you need in case
of emergency. They invest in very safe fixed-income securities, such as
highly rated investments that come due in 90 days or less. Money mar-
kets generally invest in short-term Treasuries and commercial paper.
Commercial paper obligations are loans generally given to creditworthy
companies to fund short-term needs, such as buying goods to be sold 
in a few months. Money markets, however, aren’t insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. (You can find out what is, and isn’t,
insured by the FDIC at www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/
information/fdiciorn.html.)
Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.com) is a useful site to find the best
money market fund for you. The site’s CD & Investments tab has a great
money marker account screener that you can use to pick a money
market account that best suits your needs. 
 Certificates of deposit (CDs): If you want an even safer investment than
a money market — and are willing to take a lower return — you might
want to consider a certificate of deposit. CDs are typically issued by
banks, and their interest rates can vary quite a bit. CDs are also usually
insured by the FDIC.
If you buy a CD, your money is locked up, and you’ll usually get hit with
a penalty if you need the money earlier. If you need access to your
money, a money market might be a better choice.
If you’re looking for the highest CD rates, these sites might help: 
• Bankrate.com: (www.bankrate.com) Bankrate.com can help you
track down a money market fund, but it can also help you pinpoint
the highest yielding CDs. Just click the CDs & Investments tab to
bring up a page with various CD tables, CD calculators, and CD
search tools. 
• Money-Rates.com: (http://money-rates.com) This site lists
national averages for CDs, money markets, and Treasuries. 
• iMoneyNet: (www.imoneynet.com) And you thought iMoney was
the green stuff you set aside to buy a new iPhone. iMoney is in fact a
great source of info for all things money funds related. It explains the
different types of money funds and provides average rates. You can
also use the site to find large and highly regarded money market
funds. iMoneyNet’s Money Fund Basics (http://imoneynet.com/
mfBasics.htm) explains the details about these investments. 
You might be able to buy some money market funds through your online
broker, but sometimes you need to contact the money market provider
directly through its Web site. With CDs, you need to sign up over the bank’s
Web site.

Wall Street’s lost child: Preferred stock
There are advantages and disadvantages to
bonds and stock, which is probably why there’s
room for both in most portfolios. But there’s a
unique security that’s kind of like the Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde of Wall Street: preferred stock. 
Preferred stock, commonly called preferreds,
tries to give investors the best of both worlds.
Preferred stock is a special type of stock that’s
sold by companies and acts more like a bond.
Companies pay preferred stock holders a fixed
dividend from earnings. Unlike with bonds,
though, the company isn’t obligated to pay the
dividend if it doesn’t have adequate earnings. If a
company hits a tough patch, it can delay paying
the preferred dividend until it regains its footing,
after which it must pay the dividends it missed. 
Preferreds have some advantages over bonds,
though. Many preferreds give investors the option
to convert their preferred stock into common
stock. You might have the right to own a part of the
company and enjoy the upside, rather than just
collect a fixed interest payment. You can also buy
preferred stocks through most online brokers.
Keep in mind, though, that many preferred stocks
are callable, meaning a company can retire the
shares by paying investors’ money back, at any
time. If that happens, you’ll no longer receive the
interest payments.
You can find out more about preferred stock at
these Web sites:
 Winans International:(www.winansintl.
com/Investment%20Products.htm)
Winans International maintains an index that
tracks the value of preferred stock, called the

W
hen people tell me they’re afraid to start investing online, most of the
time it’s the fear of making a mistake that’s holding them back. With
its jargon, formulas, charts, and Wall Street slang, investing online can seem
scary and intimidating. For some investors, the thought of managing their
money by themselves is overwhelming. The fear of making a mistake and
losing hard-earned money is too much to bear. 
Calming these fears is what this chapter is all about. After answering thou-
sands of e-mails sent to me by readers of my online Ask Matt column at
USATODAY.com, I’ve heard it all. Most of the mistakes investors make can 
be neatly placed into ten categories, each of which I explain in this chapter.
By reading about the common mistakes other online investors make, you’ll
probably think twice before committing them yourself. I discuss the ten 
most common mistakes, explain why they’re made, and show you how to
avoid them. 
Buying and Selling Too Frequently
One of the greatest things about online investing is that it gives investors 
the power to buy and sell stocks whenever they want. Unfortunately, though,
some investors turn this 24/7 access to their portfolios and stock trading into
a liability. 

Don’t get me wrong; it’s great that investors can check their portfolios when-
ever they want instead of calling a broker or waiting for a printed brokerage
statement to arrive in the mail. It’s just that constant access turns some
investors into 
 Obsessive portfolio checkers: These investors are constantly logging in
to their online brokerage accounts and checking the value of their portfo-
lios. And I mean constantly — often several times a day. This is a problem
because it makes investors get overly concerned about the short-term
swings in their stocks. 
If the market falls 1% one day, these investors measure how much
money they lost and start thinking about all the things they could have
bought if they’d just sold the day before. Clearly, no one can have the
foresight to sell ahead of a 1% downdraft, much less a 10% correction.
But these obsessive investors start to take every $1 move in their 
portfolio personally. 
Checking your portfolio’s value online is fine, unless it starts to affect
your judgment. If you find you’re telling yourself you should have sold
or bought because the market is up or down in a given day, you might 
be missing the point of investing. 
 Trigger-fingered investors: These investors are so antsy that they can’t
help but trade. They buy and sell stocks in a flash, well, just because
they can. Trigger-fingered investors figure commissions are so cheap
that there’s no harm in picking up shares of a stock, trying it out, and
then dumping it if it doesn’t work out. Trigger-fingered investors also
seem to get a rush out of trading online, much like someone might get
when pulling on the arm of a slot machine. 
The trouble, though, is that these investors are hurting themselves more
than helping. Not only are they paying more in taxes than they should, but
they’re setting themselves up for losses as they dump stocks they can’t
remember why they bought in the first place. Without an asset allocation
plan in place, these investors are just haphazardly buying stocks and have
no idea what their plan is. You can find out how to determine the perfect
asset allocation for you in Chapter 9.
Letting Losers Run and 
Cutting Winners Short
Human nature, in some respects, is your worst enemy when investing online.
Humans react in particular ways when faced with certain circumstances, but
those reactions can work against you in investing. Two of those elements of
human nature are defending bad decisions too long and cashing in on good
decisions too early. 
354
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

If you’ve ever been to Las Vegas, you’ve seen this before. Just walk over to
one of the cash machines scattered on the casino floor, and you’re sure to
bump into people who lost all the cash they brought so they’re pulling out
another $500. These people figure they’ll “win it all back” if they keep trying.
The same thing, sadly, happens with some investors. Investors who buy an
individual stock that collapses often hang onto it, figuring that “it will come
back” because “it’s a good company.” 
When you’re buying individual stocks, it’s critical that you cut your losses.
Pick a percentage you’re willing to risk and stick with it. You can use stop
market orders or protective puts, both described in Chapter 5. 
Other investors make the opposite mistake by cashing in winning stocks too
soon. Say your asset allocation tells you to put 20% of your stocks in emerg-
ing markets, so you buy an emerging markets index mutual fund. If emerging
markets soar in the following few weeks, but your emerging market index
fund still accounts for 20% or less of your portfolio, you should resist the
temptation to sell it all to lock in your gains. Instead, you should stick with
your asset allocation. To understand how asset allocations can boost your
returns and cut your risk, read Chapter 9. 
The rule of cutting losses short applies to individual stocks. If you don’t think
you’ll have the courage to sell individual stocks when they sink, you should
instead invest in index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that
follow a broad stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. These
investments are already diversified and less risky than individual stocks, so
you don’t have to worry so much about a 40% or greater decline. 
Focusing on the Per-Share 
Price of the Stock
The fact that one stock is $2 a share and another is $500 a share tells you
absolutely nothing about either stock. The $2-a-share stock might actually be
more expensive than the $500-a-share stock because it either doesn’t grow as
rapidly, doesn’t earn as much relative to its stock price, or is riskier. 
A stock’s per-share price is meaningful only if you compare it with something
else. Typically, investors multiply the stock price by the stock’s number of
shares outstanding to get the company’s market value or market capitalization.
A stock’s market value tells you whether a stock is small, medium, or large and
gives you a good idea of its valuation. Chapter 9 explains why the size of a
stock’s market value is so important.
Don’t be fooled into thinking it’s better to own 1,000 shares of a $2 stock 
than owning 100 shares of a $20 stock. What really matters is the company’s
355
Chapter 17: Ten Top Mistakes Made by Online Investors

valuation and market value. Think of it this way: What’s better, buying one
reliable car for $8,000 or ten unreliable and broken-down $800 cars? 
Failing to Track Risk and Return
For some reason, prudence vanishes when it comes to online investing. Many
online investors, perhaps because it takes some effort and practice, don’t take
the time to see how much risk they’re taking on to get the reward they’re
expecting from stocks they buy. 
The biggest danger of investing without knowing your risk and return is that
you risk not knowing whether you’re doing more harm than good to your
portfolio. You might be spending a great deal of time and effort buying indi-
vidual stocks thinking the effort is worthwhile, but it might turn out you’d be
better off buying and holding index mutual funds. Instead of burning hours
looking at stock charts, you might be better off spending the time with your
family, on hobbies, or at work. 
Chapter 8 shows you the techniques of measuring your portfolio. You can
find out how to calculate the returns and risk yourself or check out Web sites
that will do it for you. 
Taking Advice from the Wrong People
It’s almost hard not to get stock tips. Turn on the TV. Talk to people sitting
next to you on an airplane. Chat with other browsers in the financial section
of the bookstore (unless they’re reading Investing Online For Dummies, of
course). Connect with other investors online. You’ll constantly encounter
people who are convinced such-and-such stock is going to take off and that
you need to buy in now. Some of my readers have told me they’ve bought
shares of retailers because employees told them to. 
Here’s my advice: Unless Warren Buffett is the guy sitting next to you on the
airplane, you’re better off politely nodding and wiping your memory clean of
all the investing advice you get. Stick with your asset allocation plan. 
You should also be cautious of advice you’re getting from a financial advisor
that you hire. The two things you should do when evaluating your advisors are
 Use online broker screening tools. You want to meticulously check to
make sure the person giving you advice has the right licenses. Chapter 4
contains some online ways to check out your broker. You’ll want to make
sure you use The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s BrokerCheck
(www.finra.org). Just click the FINRA BrokerCheck link on the left
356
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

side of the page and follow the directions. I give you additional tips on
how to avoid scams in Chapter 18.
 Track the advisor’s performance. You might not be making the calls in
your portfolio, but you still want to make sure your advisor is getting you
adequate returns for the risk you’re taking. That also goes for any stock-
picking newsletters or Web sites that promise to make you fabulously
rich. Use the tools and techniques in Chapter 8 to make sure you’re 
getting what you’re paying for.
Trying to Make Too Much 
Money Too Quickly
The reason you invest is to make money. That’s the American way. But as an
investor, you need to appreciate that wealth is built over time as companies
you’ve invested in expand their revenue and earnings. Generally speaking,
stocks have returned about 10% a year. You can boost that 10% a bit to 13%
or so with smart asset allocation and exposure to riskier types of stocks like
emerging markets and small companies. 
Some investors, though, just aren’t satisfied with that. They chase after
brand-new IPOs, pile into stocks that have been the market’s leaders, and
load up on penny stocks. These investors are typically the ones that get
sucked into “get rich quick” e-mails, stock conferences, and other dubious
stock promotion schemes that make only their promoters rich. 
Sometimes things work out okay for these speculators, and they might buy
shares of the right stock at the right time. But more often than not, these
speculators suffer as the stocks whip around more than they expected. The
volatility proves too much to bear, and the speculators buy and sell stocks at
the wrong times. Before they know it, speculators are down 30% or more and
then write to me on my online column asking what to do. 
I suppose that if you limit your investment to a small amount, there’s no 
harm. But for the bulk of your portfolio, you’ll find much better success over
the long term if you read Chapters 8 and 9 and find out how to track your risk
and return. 
Letting Emotions Take Over
It’s happened to you before: You’ve fallen in love. No, I’m not talking about your
spouse or significant other. I’m talking about your favorite stock. Everyone has
had one. The stock you fall in love with is the one that you happened to buy at
just the right time and have never lost money on. It might be the one that soars
357
Chapter 17: Ten Top Mistakes Made by Online Investors

and always shows up on the “Top Performers” lists printed by magazines and
Web sites. It’s easy to be proud of a stock just like parents who see their kid’s
name in the paper for being on the Honor Roll. 
The opposite happens, too. Say your asset allocation calls for you to own
large-company stocks, you invest in them, and they do nothing. There you
are, you own shares of big companies and watch your portfolio go sideways
while your friends brag about the tiny upstarts and penny stocks they make 
a fortune on. 
Periods of self-doubt and second-guessing account for many investors’ worst
decisions. These investors might be so blinded by their enduring affection for a
stock they that proudly ride it down lower and lower. It’s funny, but the love for
the stock wears pretty thin by the time the stock is down 50% or more. What’s
the answer to this? Unless you’re a robot or computer, you’re stuck with your
emotions. But you can stop these emotions from meddling with your portfolio
by sticking with your asset allocation plan. Yes, I know this asset allocation
stuff is getting repetitive, but trust me, it will protect you from yourself.
Emotions can burn you badly with investments that just keep going down. It’s
easy to get so fed up with certain stocks you can’t bear to keep buying more.
You curse at your asset allocation for ruining your portfolio. You might get 
so disgusted with stocks you either inquire about CDs from your local bank
or start scanning the “new high” lists for stocks you think will be your ticket
to riches. 
If you let your greed for huge returns and fear of losses run your investment
decisions, you can practically guarantee you’ll buy and sell at the wrong time. 
If you find that you’re an emotional investor and take the market’s move-
ments too close to heart, you’re probably a good candidate to invest in 
passive index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. You can just buy
these investments and let them ride, removing the temptation to tinker with
your portfolio and almost guaranteeing you better results. 
Looking to Blame Someone 
Else for Your Losses
No one likes to lose money on stocks. And everyone loses money on stocks
from time to time. It’s how you react to the losses that makes the difference.
Some investors go on a witch hunt and start trying to track down anyone
who might have mentioned a stock as a good buy, ranging from publications,
358
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Web sites, friends, or the company’s executives. These investors are gener-
ally the first in line to join securities class-action lawsuits and try to sue the
company or executives. 
Certainly there are cases of fraud, in the mold of Enron and Worldcom. These
cases are regrettable because even investors who attempted to do their
homework by studying the company’s financials were misled. But if you just
lost money because you bought a stock at the wrong time or overestimated
the company’s profit potential, you can only look to yourself. It’s best to ana-
lyze what you did right, what you did wrong, and learn from it as opposed to
playing an unproductive blame game.
Sometimes investors truly are wronged by companies’ managements. In
those cases, securities class-action lawsuits attempt to extract money for the
shareholders. You can find out whether shareholders are suing a company by
using Stanford Law School’s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse
(http://securities.stanford.edu). If there’s a suit, you generally must
fill out a claim form. You can find out how to fill out the form at Claims
Compensation Bureau (www.claimscompensation.com). Just don’t get
your hopes up. Investors generally get pennies on the dollar even if the law-
suits are successful. 
Ignoring Tax Considerations
Come tax time, each April, it’s amazing the lengths taxpayers go to cut their
tax bill by just a few bucks. Some go as far as to get married or have a child to
pay less tax to Uncle Sam. But many of these same investors ignore or aren’t
aware of ways of investing that will save them thousands on taxes. 
Uncle Sam offers extremely generous tax breaks for investors, if you just
know how to take advantage of them. Tax breaks investors should never pass
up on include
 Lower tax rates for long-term capital gains: If you can wait more than a
year before selling winning stocks, you’ll be much further ahead than
investors who trade with no regard to taxes. By holding onto stocks for
longer than a year, you usually qualify for long-term capital gains taxes,
which in many cases are half what you’ll pay if you sell stocks in a year
or less. 
 Major tax breaks on education savings: If you’re trying to save for your
child’s college, you can let Uncle Sam help out. Special education sav-
ings accounts, such as the 529 plan, let you largely shield your money
from taxes as long as it’s used to pay for school. 
359
Chapter 17: Ten Top Mistakes Made by Online Investors

Say you need to save $50,000 to pay for your kid’s college. If you ignore
the tax breaks available to you through educational savings plans like
529s, you might actually need to save $58,824. You’ll need the extra
$8,824 to pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax that might apply. 
 Major tax breaks on retirement savings: Always take advantage of any
retirement savings tax breaks you can get. Researching what’s available
to you should be the first thing you do when you start to invest. If your
company matches contributions to a 401(k) or other profit-sharing plan,
take advantage of it as soon as you can. If there’s no such plan at your
job, don’t assume nothing is available to you. Many taxpayers are enti-
tled to invest in a Roth IRA, which offers tremendous tax benefits, as
described in Chapter 3. 
Dwelling on Mistakes Too Long 
It might sound funny to tell you to not think about investing mistakes in a
chapter dedicated to mistakes, but it’s important to not let a mistake in the
past paralyze you. So, you bought a stock and rode it down too long before
selling it. Don’t linger on the mistake. Just don’t do it again, and over time,
you’ll obtain the success in investing you’re shooting for.

P
romising a big return to investors is kind of like waving red meat 
in front of a salivating tiger. Even educated investors can’t help but 
bite when offered what seems to be a plausible chance at winning big-time
returns. Investors’ innate craving for that big score makes them easy targets
for less-than-honest financial snake oil salesmen. 
It’s always been amazing to me how people are so careful about their money
in everyday life but let their guard down then it comes to investing. The same
people who clip coupons and shop at discount stores to save a few bucks will
readily hand over their life’s savings to a stranger with dubious qualifications
selling questionable investments. 
It’s up to you to do your homework when checking into any investments.
Online tools make it easier than ever to sniff out unscrupulous people hawk-
ing investment products. Unfortunately, though, the Internet is also a boon for
the bad guys. E-mail lets fraudsters reach millions of users with the click of a
button. Fraudsters can also glean basic information about you online, perhaps
from your blog, or online diary, and craft a pitch that seems more realistic and
personable. Keeping these things in mind, this chapter points out some of 
the main types of investments frauds and shows you how to dodge them. 

Beware of Pyramid Schemes
When it comes to investment frauds, pyramid schemes are among the greatest
hits. Organizers behind pyramid schemes try to convince investors to con-
tribute money and tempt them with promises of a giant payout. That sounds
like playing the lottery, I know. But what makes pyramid schemes so insidious
is that they’re based on a sham that eventually collapses. 
Generally, pyramid schemes work like this: Six fraudsters send out e-mails 
to as many people as they can, each hoping to get six additional “investors.”
These initial promoters convince investors to sign up by telling them that if
they contribute money, they’ll get a 100% or greater return in just 90 days. If
the six initial promoters are successful in lining up other participants, they
pocket the money from the new investors. But, that’s just the tip of the pyra-
mid, so to speak. The 36 just-recruited investors are then instructed to get 
six more investors each, which brings the total number of investors in the
scheme to 216. The scheme then continues, and each time more investors 
are brought in, the previous investors get their payout. 
There’s just one big problem: The pyramid collapses under its own weight.
After 13 rounds of this pyramid scheme, for instance, more than 13 billion
people are required to keep it going. That’s impossible because it exceeds the
world’s population. So unless you think you can find six suckers on Mars or
Jupiter to buy your stake of a pyramid scheme, you could end up losing your
investment. The Securities and Exchange Commission provides helpful infor-
mation on pyramid schemes at http://sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm. 
Pyramid schemes have a close relative: multilevel marketing plans. In 
a multilevel marketing plan, a company e-mails you with an offer to make 
you a distributor of its products — usually pills or medical devices — that
promise miraculous benefits. These plans not only promise to pay commis-
sions if you’re able to sell the products, but also pay you if you find other 
distributors. The problem is that these are often based on pyramid schemes
at www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/invest/mlm.shtm. The Federal
Trade Commission provides tips on how to avoid getting caught up in these
plans. You should also always run a company through the Better Business
Bureau’s Web site (www.bbb.org) to make sure it’s legitimate. 
Just because a company is in the BBB database and doesn’t have any com-
plaints, that doesn’t mean it’s safe. The company could be new and looking for
fresh victims. The BBB site, though, is a good place to start. It’s a good idea 
to also run the owners’ names through the SEC’s Web site (http://sec.gov)
to see whether there have been any prior run-ins with regulators. 
362
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Steer Clear of Ponzi Schemes
Ponzi schemes are some of the oldest frauds in the book. Ponzi schemes are 
a type of pyramid scheme with one key difference: All the “investors’” money
goes to one person — the organizer of the fraud.
Ponzi schemes are pretty simple. The organizer sends out e-mails offering
investors fabulous returns in a very short period of time. After the initial
investors eagerly sign up, the Ponzi promoter takes a cut and then seeks a
second round of investors. When the money comes in from the second round
of investors, the Ponzi operator takes another cut but also returns a slice of the
money to the first round of investors. Clearly, the first investors are ecstatic
and eager to tell others about their great investment. Those testimonials play
right into the Ponzi operator’s hand, who keeps repeating the process until it
falls apart. 
Avoid Tout Sheets and Know Who 
You’re Taking Advice From
There’s no shortage of investment and stock-picking newsletters that claim 
to have the inside track on the stocks you need to buy now. But some of these
newsletters, known in the trade as tout sheets, have nefarious intentions. Tout
sheets are investment newsletters distributed for the sole purpose of hyping
stocks with exaggerated or false information to stir up investors’ interest. Tout
sheet have proliferated due to the Internet, which makes distributing and pro-
moting such things a cinch. (You can read more about investment newsletters
in general in Chapter 15.)
Above all, you need to be perfectly sure an online newsletter is above board.
Whenever considering subscribing to a newsletter or following its suggestions,
you want to be 100% clear on whether the newsletter writer is paid by the com-
panies to be a tout. Touts are hired by companies or shady brokerage firms to
stoke interest in stocks by putting out glowing reports on the company based
on exaggeration or lies. If the tout is successful in attracting investors and 
driving up the stock price, the company’s executives and brokerage firm can
then sell and pocket the quick profit. 
The SEC is somewhat restricted in its ability to crack down on newsletters.
The First Amendment allows anyone to make statements, including about
stocks. The SEC can get involved, though, when the newsletter writers are
paid for issuing misleading statements about a stock for personal gain. 
363
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Protect Your Investments and Identity Online

The SEC (http://sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud/newsletter.
htm) warns investors to be especially skeptical of online newsletters that
vaguely say how they’re paid. A statement like “From time to time, XYZ
Newsletter may receive compensation from companies we write about,” is 
a huge red flag, says the SEC. You should also avoid newsletters that say
they’re paid to promote stocks in tiny or hidden places in the newsletter. 
Check up on newsletters, or any other stock promoter for that matter, by
searching the following sites:
 The SEC’s Division of Enforcement page (http://sec.gov/
divisions/enforce.shtml) is a great site for all things fraudulent.
You can click the Enforcement Actions link to see whether the newsletter
you’re looking at has been accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
 The SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure page (www.adviser
info.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/IapdMain/iapd_SiteMap.aspx) is
an excellent way to check up on “investment advisers.” Many, but not all,
professionals who dispense advice to investors are required to file Form
ADVs with the SEC. The Form ADV contains information about the adviser
or advisory firm, including any disciplinary actions. To access the site,
just click the Investment Adviser Search link on the left side and follow 
the directions.
 The North American Securities Administrators Association
(www.nasaa.org/QuickLinks/ContactYourRegulator.cfm) 
provides helpful information about securities crackdowns in various
states. Just click your state in the 50-state map and the site will direct
you to the appropriate state regulators that punish securities fraudsters. 
 Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (http://cfp.net) lets
you quickly see whether someone who claims to be a Certified Financial
Planner, or CFP, really is. Just click the SEARCH for a Certified Financial
Planner Professional link on the navigation bar on the left side. Enter the
person’s last name, choose the state, and click the Search button. 
Don’t Fall for Investment Spam E-Mails
Open your e-mail box, and you’re likely to find all sorts of offers. You’ll see
pitches selling Vioxx for next to nothing, ways to get Microsoft to write you 
a giant check, and hot tips on stocks about to take off. 
Generally these spam e-mails, or unsolicited promotional e-mail messages,
are all very similar. The e-mails masquerade as being legitimate reports from
stock research firms or investors who are in the know that are passing along
their tips out of generosity. The messages will talk about some major devel-
opment that will move the stock by a huge amount in a short period of time.
364
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

And the e-mails generally pitch stocks with very low share prices that trade
on lesser regulated markets, like the Pink Sheets. 
If you get such spam, don’t even read it. Trash that rotten spam immediately.
They’re almost always pump-and-dump schemes. They work like this: The
fraudsters first pick a few lightly traded stocks and buy them up. After the
promotional e-mail goes out, the fraudsters wait for gullible investors to buy
shares and drive the stock price up. That’s the pump part of pump and dump.
Next, these investors sell their shares. That’s the dump.
Sadly, many investors fall for these schemes. A study from Rainer Bohme 
and Thorsten Holz of the Dresden University of Technology and University of
Mannheim (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_
id=897431) found stock prices do react to these e-mails, indicating investors
are reading them and buying the stocks.
Don’t think for a moment you can profit from these spam e-mails. Spam Stock
Tracker (www.spamstocktracker.com) has tracked how investors would
have done if they’d bought the stocks recommended through spam e-mails.
The study found in just a year and a half, investors who bought the stocks
suggested in the spam would have lost more than 90% of their money.
Don’t fall for the e-mails from supposed Nigerian nationals hoping to transfer
cash to the United States, either. They’re scams called advance fee frauds, or
4-1-9 frauds after that section of the Nigerian penal code. Don’t participate in
these. The Secret Service (www.secretservice.gov/faq.shtml#faq15 )
provides information on these scams if you’re interested.
Understand Loopholes 
Scammers Can Use
Before you invest your money in anything, your first stop should be the SEC’s
Web site at http://sec.gov. You should always find out whether there are
any regulatory filings on the investment or person selling the investments. 
If you’re looking to buy a stock, for instance, you can download the com-
pany’s regulatory filings as explained in Chapter 2. Companies with more
than 500 investors and $10 million in assets must file statements with the
SEC. Companies listed on major exchanges, such as the New York Stock
Exchange and NASDAQ, must also file statements. If it’s a broker or an invest-
ment newsletter you’re interested in checking up on, you can follow the
instructions in the section about that tells you how to research tout sheets. 
If you’re not able to turn up any filings, your defenses should go up. Scamsters
know there are loopholes in SEC rules — originally designed to help small
companies avoid bureaucratic red tape — that allow them to avoid filing
365
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Protect Your Investments and Identity Online

potentially troublesome documents. You can read about these loopholes 
fully for yourself on the SEC’s Web site (www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/
qasbsec.htm) in the section titled, “Are There Legal Ways to Offer and Sell
Securities Without Registering With the SEC?”
But to save you the trouble, below are summaries of the primary loopholes
that may allow certain firms to avoid filing documents with the SEC:
 Intrastate offerings occur when a local business sells investments to
residents of the state it primarily does business in. This is called the
intrastate offering exemption. 
 Private offerings take place when companies only sell investments to
investors that have deep understanding of business and also provide
financial information to these investors. 
 Regulation A is an SEC exemption that kicks in when firms raise less
than $5 million in a 12-month period. Regulation A allows companies to
file paper statements called offering circulars with the SEC instead of
making their information readily available online. Offering circulars con-
tain limited information and can be hard to get because they’re often
filed only on paper in Washington D.C. 
 Regulation D is a more common SEC exemption that applies to firms that
meet a variety of requirements, including raising less than $1 million in a
12-month period or selling investments only to “accredited investors” who
are very sophisticated. These firms need to file only a Form D with the
SEC. A Form D offers just bare-bones information and provides few details
other than the names of the company’s owners. You can read more about
Regulation D from at http://sec.gov/answers/regd.htm.
If you can’t find a company on the SEC’s Web site, call or e-mail the SEC
(http://sec.gov/contact.shtml) to see whether paper forms are avail-
able. You should also contact your state’s regulator, which you can find from
The North American Securities Administrators Association (www.nasaa.org). 
Familiarize Yourself with the
Fingerprints of a Scam
There are only so many ways to rob a bank. Face it; most of the scams fraud-
sters use online and off generally fall into just a few categories, most of which
are variants of pyramid or Ponzi schemes. Sure, there are twists, such as
affinity frauds (http://sec.gov/investor/pubs/affinity.htm), where
the scammers infiltrate a group of investors of a similar age, race, or hobby,
gain the trust of the group, and then use the group members to promote the
scheme to each other.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Still, a few common traits should set off alarm bells in your head:
 Promises of guaranteed returns that seem abnormally large: By read-
ing Chapter 1, you know that stocks have returned roughly 10% average
annual returns. If someone tells you he can get you a return of greater
than 10% a year, you know the investment is riskier than stocks. So if 
the promoter says the returns are guaranteed or risk-free, you know
something isn’t right. 
 Pressure to act right now: Perpetrators of frauds know they have to get
your checkbook open now, or you might get cold feet and start thinking
about the risks. If you’re told you have to invest now or you’ll miss out,
you’re better missing out on the “opportunity.” 
 No documentation on paper: Bad guys hate paper trails and try their
best to avoid documenting anything. If you can’t print out the informa-
tion about an investment, you shouldn’t invest in it. Proper investment
proposals should be registered with regulators and come with a
prospectus, an annual report, and other financial statements. 
The SEC provides a list of other telltale signs of online frauds (http://sec.
gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud/signs.htm), which are worthwhile
checking out. 
Learn to Be an Online Sleuth
Scammers often reinvent themselves and try different scams until they 
get caught. If you’re being pitched an investment or seminar, try to find out
whether the person is working under an alias or has sold investments before.
Get as much information as you can about the person, and use the Web
search techniques described in Chapter 2 to see whether you can turn up
more information. 
It’s also important to find out whether a regulator or private party has gone
after a company or broker to recover funds. There are three main places to
check:
 The SEC’s Investors Claims Funds (http://sec.gov/divisions/
enforce/claims.htm) is a list of all the companies that have been 
targeted by enforcement actions that resulted in funds being given back
to investors. 
 The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (www.sipc.org/
cases/sipccasesopen.cfm) maintains a list of brokers that have gone
out of business and are being liquidated. You’ll also find instructions on
how to fill out a claim form to make sure you get your money back. 
367
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Protect Your Investments and Identity Online

 The Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse
(http://securities.stanford.edu) provides a free database 
of companies that are being sued by investors for securities fraud. 
Know How to Complain if 
You Suspect a Fraud
It might be embarrassing if you’ve been taken in by a fraud. But if you feel
that you’ve been had, it’s critical that you let regulators know right away. The
sooner you can tip off the authorities, the greater the chance the fraudster
can be nailed and the better the chance of recovering money. 
The SEC’s Center for Complaints and Enforcement Tips (http://sec.gov/
complaint.shtml) allows you to fill out electronic forms to alert regulators
to a possible fraud. Give as much detail about the alleged fraud as you can to
help investigators who might decide to take your case. 
Make Sure Your Computer 
Is Locked Down
You should always be concerned with computer security. Make sure you have
the proper software and other safeguards installed to protect your computer
from viruses and hackers. You have many options, including some offered by
the online brokers themselves. When you’re online using a public wireless net-
work service, such as those in Starbucks coffeehouses, you should be espe-
cially careful. You can read more about ways to lock down your computer in
Chapter 2. 
But online criminals also use other low-tech methods to bilk investors. The
most common trick used is phishing, which is pronounced “fishing.” In phishing
scams, the fraudster sends out millions of e-mails purporting to be from a bank
(say Citibank), a store (like Circuit City), a government agency (say the Internal
Revenue Service) or an online service (like PayPal or eBay). These e-mails are
carefully crafted to appear official and generally ask the recipients to click 
a link to confirm or update personal information. 
Here are a couple ways to protect yourself from these scams:
 Log in routinely: Log in to your bank, online broker, PayPal, and other
important accounts directly and routinely check the “messages section.
Generally, when these companies want to reach you, they leave a message
for you on the site. 
368
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Never click links in e-mails: If you get an e-mail claiming to be from your
online brokerage, assume it’s a fraud. Don’t click the link in the e-mail
that claims to direct you to the Web site. Instead, manually enter the
site’s address into your browser or click the Favorite for the site that
you set up. 
 Hover your pointer over the link: If you want to know whether the e-mail
is phishing for information, put your pointer over the link in the e-mail. Do
not click the link, but look in the lower-left corner of the screen. You see
the address the link wants to take you to. If it’s not the complete address
of the site it purports to be, you know instantly it’s a fraud. 
Be Aware of Online Sources 
for More Information
Scams are constantly evolving. It’s up to you to be constantly vigilant and be
aware the Internet is a perfect environment for people trying to fool you and
take your money. That doesn’t mean you should unplug your computer and
give up on online investing. It’s just that it’s up to you to be aware of the
potential risks. 
Internet sources can help online investors understand how to protect 
themselves, including
 The SEC’s Web site (http://sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud.
htm) explains many of the common online investing frauds and gives
detailed examples. If you’re new to online investing, this site is very
worthwhile and will make you more street-smart and aware of the 
dangers. 
 Fraud Discovery Institute (www.barryminkow.com/index.html) 
is operated by Barry Minkow, a former fraudster convicted for being 
the mastermind behind the Zzzz Best “carpet-cleaning” business that
bilked investors out of millions in the 1980s. Minkow is now a Christian
minister and operates the Fraud Discovery Institute, which seeks to sniff
out frauds in the making. In addition to serving up warnings of potential
frauds, Fraud Discovery Institute is also a useful source that shows
investors how frauds are detected and how to avoid them. 
The Journal of Accountancy Online (www.aicpa.org/pubs/jofa/
aug2001/wells.htm) steps investors through the process of how 
reading financial statements could have warned them of the Zzzz Best
fraud ahead of time.

Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Protect Your Investments and Identity Online

 Investor Protection Trust (www.investorprotection.org/upr/
initiatives.html) provides links to a variety of investor education
materials. You can download a free course on how to avoid investment
fraud at www.investorprotection.org/basics/06_Basics_
Unit4.pdf. 
 Investor’s Watchdog (www.investorswatchdog.com) helps investors
teach themselves how to identify an investment scam before being taken
in. Stories detail recent frauds and tips on how to smell a scam before
it’s too late.
