Preface
There are many web content management systems available in the market today, 
either proprietary or open source. They help you to design a website, create web 
pages, link all media assets, edit the pages inline, and manage the look and feel 
of using templates. However, most of them use a single system for authoring and 
delivery, do not provide a validation process, do not secure the websites in more 
detail, cannot reuse the content effectively, and cannot integrate with external system 
to share the web content.
Alfresco provides a robust, easy to use, and scalable web content framework for 
managing multiple websites leveraging a common web infrastructure. Alfresco 
provides a publishing style web CMS, where you can create, preview, and approve 
the content on staging instance and then deploy the websites to test and/or 
production environments. It allows the separation of content from the look and feel 
and thus provides multiple usage of the same content by many other applications.
Alfresco offers true Web Content Management (WCM) by providing an open 
source alternative to expensive proprietary systems such as Microsoft SharePoint, 
Interwoven, and IBM Content Manager. Alfresco WCM is a good fit for the 
customers who are also looking for cost savings.
This book will guide you through creating, managing, and publishing web content in 
staging, test, and production environments. It will help you set up an infrastructure for 
supporting multiple websites using Alfresco, enabling a shortened web development 
cycle and providing a high return on investment, despite a low cost of ownership.
This book takes a step-by-step approach for building a complete web content 
management system using Alfresco. A greater emphasis is given to the concepts  
of web content creation and distribution. Plenty of sample code and screenshots  
are used in the book to make you confident in applying these concepts in real 
production scenarios.

A Publishing Style Web CMS
The Alfresco Web Content Management is a next generation tool that allows 
organizations to rapidly create and more effectively maintain dynamic Internet, 
intranet, and extranet sites, enabling a shortened web development cycle, providing 
high returns on investment, and low cost of ownership. WCM manages the content 
and structure of websites, including the framework and navigation, as well as the 
creation, editing, approval, and publication processes. By using Alfresco you can 
implement web content management solutions with a scalable content repository: 
Web 2.0 AJAX-based user interface, flexible workflow, multi-language support, and 
a robust search engine.
This chapter provides an introduction to Alfresco WCM, outlining the benefits 
of using it for your enterprise's web content management requirements. It also 
introduces the new features of the Alfresco WCM.
In this chapter, you will learn about:
• 
Alfresco WCM architecture
• 
The Alfresco WCM model
• 
Features of Alfresco WCM 
• 
Benefits
Good web content management pays big 
dividends
When an organization's management team is reviewing budgetary proposals, the 
price tag associated with a new computing solution often elicits one question: "Can't 
we avoid this expense?" The answer is obvious: you can continue to operate your 
websites without the benefit of a content management solution. However, the real 
question should be, "What is the cost of not making this purchase?"

Here are some factors to consider:
High labor costs and the shortage of qualified 
personnel
Finding and holding on to qualified employees can be a challenge. All the more a 
reason to make the most of each individual's skill set. A web content management 
solution that empowers content providers to post directly to a live site increases their 
productivity. By the same token, IT personnel who are not ensnared in the posting 
process are free to apply their skills and knowledge to more challenging tasks. 
Providing state-of-the-art tools helps promote positive attitudes while improving 
productivity, which can go a long way in retaining skilled personnel.
How long it currently takes to implement site 
changes
Does it take hours or even days to post new content on your websites? That's often 
far too long to leave outdated or incorrect information on a site. After all, the beauty 
of the Internet is providing target audiences with 24x7 access to all of the latest 
and greatest information. When a site becomes stale, users become disenchanted 
and are less likely to return. Recapturing a user's interest is far more difficult than 
maintaining it with fresh, personalized content.
Potential problems caused by erroneous or 
out-of-date postings
When new information doesn't get posted quickly, what does it cost your 
organization? In case of a publicly-traded company, incorrect financial postings can 
have serious consequences. Providing only accurate, timely product information can 
prevent misunderstandings that lead to customer dissatisfaction. Giving distributors 
and suppliers incorrect, out-of-date, or partial information can have a negative effect 
on your bottom line. The right web content management solution, one that is easy to 
use and maintain, will help ensure that your organization provides site visitors with 
reliable content.

Revenue losses attributable to an inability to 
respond
A website that cannot be scaled to meet a business' emerging needs is just as 
serious a problem as an inability to hire more people, move to a larger facility, or 
acquire additional suppliers. Revenue can be lost and the future of the organization 
diminished. Why take such chances, especially when websites are becoming central 
to doing business?
Competitive issues related to a lack of 
planning
Hiring an experienced webmaster allows an organization to use that individual's 
skills beyond day-to-day site maintenance. A knowledgeable individual can help 
review site architecture, assess future site requirements, and implement upgrades. 
These are valuable activities for growing organizations that want to remain 
competitive in today's rapidly changing economic environment. However, when 
the webmaster must operate as a "web page processor", the time and skills of this 
valuable resource cannot be fully utilized.
The right web content management solution can allow your organization to:
• 
Make effective use of all internal resources
• 
Slash the time required to implement site content changes or redesign a site
• 
Ensure the availability of timely, accurate information
• 
Scale its website to keep pace with organizational growth
• 
Plan to accommodate new business initiatives and technological advances
Various WCM systems in the market
The worldwide Web Content Management market has been growing exponentially. 
The market maturity has homogenized much of the competition. Therefore, 
procurement decisions should be increasingly based upon vendor viability and the 
vendor's long-term product strategy. Maintaining your web assets is both a cost of 
doing business and a competitive differentiator. There are proprietary and open 
source WCMs available today for organizations to choose from. Alfresco is one of the 
leading choices when organizations look at the open source options available  
to them.

The Alfresco WCM engages customers through next-generation sites, enabling mass 
contributions from internal and external users, simple configuration via reusable 
web scripts, and low-cost massive scalability that uses commodity software and 
hardware.
Cutting edge technology, rich interface experiences, user participation, and effective 
costing are all factors that organizations seek to consider while selecting the best 
suited WCM solution for their organization.
From a high-level perspective, WCM solutions in the market today can be classified 
into two types:
• 
Wiki style
• 
Publishing style
The following table shows the differences between the two types:

The Alfresco WCM model
Content Production and Content Delivery are separated in Alfresco Web Content 
Management, as shown in the following diagram:
It is important to understand the concepts that form the basis of the Alfresco  
WCM model.
Web projects
Web projects are the production-side representation of a site. This is what manages 
the content consumed by the site. Here the access rules and roles for content 
producers are defined. Every Alfresco server can have multiple web projects. Within 
a web project the user can:
• 
View content based on the state of their User and/or Staging Sandboxes
• 
Preview content based on the state of a sandbox with workflows
• 
Upload file-based content
• 
Create web forms and manage content
• 
Submit content to staging and deploy content to a live environment
These actions can be controlled and managed through the use of workflows.
Sandboxes
Alfresco provides a sandboxed development model. Content producers make use of 
the sandboxes to make changes to a site in isolation from one another. The default 
configuration is as follows:
• 
One Staging Sandbox per web project
• 
One User Sandbox per user per web project
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
A Publishing Style Web CMS
[ 12 ]
• 
One temporary workflow sandbox per active workflow instance per  
web project:
Virtualization and In-context Preview
Virtualization and In-context Preview is core to the sandboxing concept. Virtualization 
means that each user has a complete view of all current, approved, checked in content 
along with those unique modifications made within the context of their sandbox. 
Alfresco provides a complete virtual view of the website as it would look if all changes 
in a sandbox were committed to the live site even when previewing any non-modified 
or modified asset in a sandbox. This is In-context Preview.
Each user in the context of their sandbox can do rigorous and thorough quality 
checks for all changes they are posting to the website.
Transparent layers
Transparent layers are the means to implement sandboxes in Alfresco. This layer is 
a central construct in the Advanced Versioning Manager (AVM) repository, very 
similar to the UnionFS Linux filesystem, and is used to define "composite" stores that 
can "read through" content from other stores. It can be defined at the store, directory, 
or file level.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
From Alfresco 3.1 onwards, transparent layers can be configured by a Content 
Manager in the Staging Sandbox of a web project. This is useful for:
• 
Defining web project templates
• 
Reusing content across multiple web projects
• 
Explicitly segregating different groups of content producers for separate  
web projects
Web forms
Web forms are used in Alfresco WCM to capture content from the user, and store  
as XML. An XML schema needs to be created by form developers for capturing 
content. It is then rendered automatically as a user-friendly web-based form for 
content contributors.
Alfresco uses the open source project Chiba, an XForms implementation used to 
transform the XML schema into an internal representation of a form (XForms), and 
then present UI controls for elements and attributes described in the schema. This 
helps to render the form entry UI to the end users.
Web forms are created and administered in the Web Forms space within the Data 
Dictionary. As they are located in Alfresco Spaces, they are accessible by the default 
CIFS, FTP, and WebDav interfaces. They can also be configured with rendering 
engine templates for generating renditions of the collected content.
Rendition templates
The web form-managed XML can be transformed with rendition templates and the 
corresponding content into rendered output. Server-side templating languages, 
such as FreeMarker, XSLT, and XSLT-FO are provided by Alfresco. After a content 
item (XML file) is created via a web form, each rendition template configured for 
that content type is executed, producing an output file per template (shown in the 
following diagram). Typical formats for renditions of web content include HTML, 
JSP, PDF, XML, and so on:

[ 14 ]
Web scripts
Web scripts provide RESTful access to content held within your Alfresco Enterprise 
Content Repository. You can therefore place controls on your enterprise content to 
manage it, and provide uniform access for a wide variety of client applications and 
services, such as browser, portal, search engine, or any custom application.
Web scripts allow you to:
• 
Easily access, manage, and cross-link your content via a customized RESTful 
API. You do not need any compilation, generators, server restarts, complex 
installs, tooling, or Java knowledge. All you need is your favorite text editor 
or the Alfresco Explorer web client.
• 
Build custom URI-identified and HTTP-accessible Content Management  
Web Services.
• 
Turn your Alfresco repository into a content management-powered 
HTTP server.
Workflows
Alfresco WCM uses JBoss jBPM for all workflows. There are three aspects of 
workflows in Alfresco:
• 
Workflow definition: The creation and deployment of the jBPM workflow 
into Alfresco repository.
• 
Workflow association: The assignment of a workflow to a web project, which 
specify the actors (reviewers identified).
• 
Workflow instance: Created when content that is specific to the associated 
change set is submitted. Additionally, Alfresco comes with Web Site 
Submission workflow out of the box, which allows for serial and parallel 
approval of content.
Content delivery concepts
In Alfresco there are three delivery models: static, dynamic, and a hybrid of both 
static and dynamic. In a static delivery model, all requests to the web server return a 
static file of XHTML, XML, JSON, and so on to the web client without any additional 
processing (no CGIs, no SSI, and so on).
In a dynamic delivery model, all requests to the web server return objects of type 
XHTML, XML, JSON, and so on that are processed by some application server to 
render the resulting document.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
Static delivery model
In such a model, pages are rendered as part of the content production process. The 
resulting HTML and associated assets (images, CSS, JS, and so on) are then published 
to the filesystem, typically a document root of a web server. This provides high 
levels of scalability on simplified production architectures (web server farms). This 
model, however, has limited personalization and there is a set number of rendering 
technologies (FreeMarker, XSLT, and XSLT-FO).
A File System Receiver (FSR) will need to be installed and configured to receive 
published static content from the Alfresco server. The FSR consists of a small server 
that receives updates from an Alfresco repository and publishes them to a flat 
filesystem, which is then typically served up by a web or application server. The 
following diagram illustrates this process:
Dynamic delivery model
A pure dynamic model publishes content to an Alfresco Runtime, thereby making 
the content available for dynamic queries with basically any web technology (PHP, 
Python, J2EE, AJAX, Flash, Cold Fusion, and so on). This provides ultimate flexibility 
in what and how content is displayed on a page. This provides the highest levels 
of personalization, but will require significantly more resources on the delivery 
servers for similar levels of traffic. For all but the smallest websites, significant effort 
is required in architecting, developing, and testing to ensure website or application 
stability. This is particularly the case during unexpected high-volume situations (for 
example, a Government website during a national disaster). The following diagram 
illustrates the dynamic delivery model:
www.it-ebooks.info

A Publishing Style Web CMS
[ 16 ]
An Alfresco System Receiver (ASR) will need to be installed on a server to facilitate 
the dynamic delivery model. The ASR is just another instance of the Alfresco server. 
The ASR allows a web project being authored in one Alfresco server instance to be 
deployed to another separate instance of Alfresco.
Overview of delivery models
The following is a summary of static and dynamic delivery models:
Static "Bake" Model
Dynamic "Fry" Model
Delivery technology
Web servers
Application servers
Page compositing
Submission time
Request time
Content deployed to
Filesystem
Alfresco runtime
Personalization
Limited
Unlimited
Performance
Ultimate
Less than the "bake" model
Application developer skill sets
FreeMarker, XSLT, 
XSLT-FO
Any web technology
The best of both worlds
A hybrid approach is the preferred approach regardless of the WCMS and the 
underlying technologies. Determination of what is static and what is dynamic is 
highly dependent on the type of website and web applications.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
Users also have the option of a hybrid delivery approach. This approach can be 
executed as follows:
• 
The web architecture model should be designed to support the dynamic 
model. This includes the ability to deploy content to both filesystems and 
Alfresco runtimes for flexibility.
• 
Leverage the static model wherever possible. If content must be personalized 
to a single user or a very small set of users with few "page" impressions, it 
most likely needs to be dynamic. Otherwise, it can be static.
• 
Choose a page composition model appropriate to the overall site and each 
page on the site:
°°
Outside-in: Each page is static HTML with static components already 
embedded, but dynamic components or applications such as AJAX 
and Flash can be included.
°°
Inside-out: Each page is dynamic and includes all page components 
dynamically regardless of whether those components are static  
or dynamic.
Significant enhancements in Alfresco 
WCM with Version 3.3
A bunch of new features focused on helping companies manage their web presence 
have been introduced in Version 3.3. A list of these is as follows:
• 
Alfresco Web Editor: In-context editing to Alfresco (non-AVM) stored 
content has been introduced. This will allow content authors to edit content 
items stored within an Alfresco repository directly from the web page. 
Alfresco 3.3 also provides the Web Editor Framework, a JavaScript client-side 
framework, rendering a toolbar, and associated controls.
• 
Transfer Service API: Developers can build solutions that transfer content 
between Alfresco repositories (non-AVM) using the Transfer Service API. 
This is useful to WCM architectures where Alfresco provides both authoring 
and delivery tier components and allows rich-content structures and 
relationships to be maintained between Alfresco environments.
• 
Rendition API: The Rendition API will allow developers to build solutions 
for easily repurposing content for the Web. FreeMarker and XSLT templates 
can also be used as part of the Rendition API.
www.it-ebooks.info

A Publishing Style Web CMS
[ 18 ]
• 
WCM deployment: The Alfresco Deployment Receiver is configured as  
sub-system and a new Data Dictionary folder called Web Deployed 
is configured to default as the deployment target. AVM to DM-WCM 
deployment facilities have been enhanced to add an additional deployment 
target. This additional deployment receiver allows WCM content that is 
authored and stored within the AVM to be deployed to local and remote 
Alfresco repositories (Alfresco DM).
Alfresco Web Editor
The Alfresco Web Editor (AWE) is a Spring Surf-based web application that utilizes 
the Forms Service to provide in-context editing capabilities to Alfresco repository 
content (non-AVM). Alfresco 3.3 also introduces the Web Editor Framework (WEF), 
which is a client-side JavaScript framework that is a dependency of the AWE.
With the initial release, the AWE will support JavaServer Pages (JSP)-based websites 
by providing a tag library. Additional languages will be supported in future releases 
with FreeMarker and PHP being on top of the list. The tags have been designed for 
easy implementation so that a developer can enable the AWE with minimal effort, 
and without effecting the CSS layout and design of the site.
The simplest and quickest way to deploy AWE is to use the prebuilt WAR (awe.war) 
file and deploy it in the same application server instance of your web application. 
Being a Spring Surf-based application, AWE does not have to be deployed in the 
same application server instance as the Alfresco repository. However, this section 
presumes that it is.

Summary
An easily navigated site, with information consistently organized in a logical 
fashion, is what most organizations want to provide. But delivering consistent 
organization with proper adherence to corporate branding and design standards 
can be difficult when several authors are contributing content. If more than one 
designer or Webmaster posts content, standards can easily become compromised 
and consistency diminished.
In this chapter, we have learned that Alfresco gives you a web content management 
solution that:
• 
Has content component architecture where content is separated from format; 
it is easier to reuse.
• 
Uses an open, object-based API—an open interface providing compatibility 
with new or emerging technologies.
• 
Is an open source alternative.
The next chapter focuses on installing Alfresco and various components around it. 
Installation on various operating environments is detailed therein. Also explained 
is the installation of various components like OpenOffice, ImageMagick, Microsoft 
Office Add-ins, Flash Player, and SWFTools.

Installation and Configuration
This chapter is aimed at enabling you to understand and carry out various aspects 
of the Alfresco WCM installation and configuring various components around it. 
A basic understanding of Alfresco architecture, various installation options, and 
the key terminologies used are all a part of this chapter. The Alfresco development 
environment needs to be set in place before we can work with the tools.
The installation procedures can also vary depending on the kind of system you have 
in place to set up and configure Alfresco. First, we will go through the installation 
procedures for a Microsoft Windows-based system. Linux-based systems also follow 
similar steps. We will go into detail later in the chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you will have learned the following:
• 
Components to install
• 
Configuring the Alfresco Setup
• 
The WCM Component
• 
Setting up the Alfresco WCM development environment
Following is the list of softwares you need on your machine before you  
install Alfresco:
Component
Recommendation
Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
JDK 6 is required.
Database
Alfresco comes preconfigured with the MySQL 
database. If you intend to use a different database, 
install and configure the database before you  
install Alfresco.

Component
Recommendation
OpenOffice.org
Alfresco uses OpenOffice for transforming documents 
from one format to another, for example, a text file to a 
PDF file. If you do not install OpenOffice, you will not 
have access to the transformation functionality.
Flash Player Version 10.x
Alfresco Share requires Flash Player Version 10.x to 
upload multiple files and view Flash previews. If you  
do not install Flash, you see the upload screen for  
single files.
SWFTools
Alfresco Share uses the pdf2swf utility for previewing 
PDF files. If you do not install SWFTools, you will  
not see PDF previews, but image previews will still  
be available.
Alfresco runs within an instance of the Tomcat application server. The installers and 
the Tomcat bundles are preconfigured with Tomcat. If you wish to install Alfresco 
within another application server, use the Alfresco WAR file.
Installing a JDK
A Java SE Development Kit (JDK) must be installed on your system before you install 
Alfresco. Some Alfresco installation wizards will detect whether you have a JDK on 
your machine and, if not, install a version for you. This task explains how to install 
JDK manually:
1.	 Browse to the Sun Microsystems Java download website:  
http://java.sun.com.
2.	 Select and download Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 for your platform.
3.	 If prompted, specify a location in which to download.
4.	 Navigate to where you downloaded the JDK.
5.	 Install the JDK on your system.
After the JDK is installed on your system, verify that the JAVA_HOME environment 
variable is set.

Verifying the JAVA_HOME environment 
variable location
The JAVA_HOME environment variable location must be set to where the JDK is 
installed. This is done as follows:
1.	 Open the command prompt.
2.	 Enter the following:
Windows: echo %JAVA_HOME%
Linux: echo $JAVA_HOME
Installing MySQL
This section describes how to set up a MySQL open source Relational Database 
Management System (RDBMS) to use with Alfresco. Some of the Alfresco installation 
wizards install an embedded instance of MySQL that is configured with the correct 
settings. If you prefer to install MySQL database independently, this section 
describes the configuration settings that you should use:
1.	 Browse to the MySQL download site: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads.
2.	 Locate and select the appropriate package for your platform. Alfresco 
requires MySQL 5.0.67 or higher.
3.	 If prompted, specify a location on your system in which to download and 
install MySQL.
4.	 Browse to the location where you downloaded MySQL and double-click on 
the installer file.
5.	 The MySQL Server Setup wizard guides you through the MySQL 
installation, followed by the Configuration wizard.
Verifying the MySQL installation
Once you have installed MySQL, this task describes how to verify that it was 
installed correctly:
1.	 Open the command prompt.
2.	 In the prompt, enter:
mysql -u root -p

3.	 Type the password that you set during the installation and press Enter. 
Information about the installed MySQL version displays. If no errors are 
reported, MySQL is installed and running.
4.	 In the mysql> prompt, type exit to exit MySQL. You have verified that the 
MySQL installation was successful.
Alfresco WCM
Alfresco is built on state-of-the-art open source components such as Spring, 
Hibernate, Lucene, and JSF—often the components of choice for website developers 
today. It offers one repository for the whole team. This repository is a modern 
platform for Web Content Management 2.0 with a variety of user and technical 
benefits as described and discussed through the course of this book.
The web development framework comprises:
Java
JSF, Struts, Wicket, among others
Ruby
Ruby on Rails
.NET
ASP.NET
PHP
Zend, CakePHP, Codelgniter
Python
Django
Alfresco can be used by all of the previously mentioned frameworks. Each of them 
has different capabilities and often requires different implementation strategies. 
Using Alfresco WCM, you can provide a wealth of flexibility and choices when 
designing scalable web architecture.
The following diagram shows a possible physical architecture for a WCM solution:

[ 25 ]
WCM can be recommended to be used when:
• 
The authors are comfortable using the Alfresco Web Client and web forms
• 
Minimal time should be spent creating a robust presentation tier
• 
You need the ability to roll back change sets
• 
You only need to link to WCM content and basic URLs
• 
You need to have a staging environment where content is reviewed before it 
is published
• 
Simple "submit for approval" workflow is sufficient

Installation option that is suitable for you
Alfresco is a 100 percent open source software developed using open standards. 
It can be operated on various operating systems, relational databases, application 
servers, web browsers, portals, and supports various languages. We shall examine all 
of the choices and determine which option is right for you.
Enterprise and Community Editions
Alfresco currently provides two types of product download options:
• 
Alfresco Community Lab Network
• 
Alfresco Enterprise Network
The latest release of Alfresco has an Enterprise Edition as well as a Labs edition.
Both the options have the same code base and features, and are 100 percent open 
source. For both the options, you can use Alfresco documentation (wiki), community 
support (forums), and community-contributed add-on products. The Alfresco 
Community Lab Network is free. The Alfresco Enterprise Network includes a per 
CPU license fee.
The Alfresco Community Labs Network is an unsupported product and is mainly 
designed for developers and technical enthusiasts. It is designed in non-critical 
environments. Alfresco Community Lab releases Early and Often and renders a  
daily build, offering the latest functionality. It doesn't provide scalability and  
high-availability certifications. I would recommend this to be used as the research 
vehicle for new features and as the platform for the Alfresco Community. And 
consider it as a test drive before you install.
If you are implementing Alfresco for a major corporation, financial, insurance, 
government, or healthcare organization, I would recommend you go for Alfresco 
Enterprise Network support. The primary benefit is that with the support of Alfresco 
and its certified partners you will get a stable, reliable, certified, and supported 
application with warranty and indemnity. Your Alfresco version will be certified on 
all available stacks such as Linux, Windows, MySQL, Oracle, and many more. You 
will benefit from Alfresco support, which includes problem resolution, compatibility 
advice, migration advice, and upgrade support. For mission-critical applications, you 
will get 24/7 support from Alfresco experts.

Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
Choosing an operating system to run Alfresco will be based on various factors. 
For some companies it depends on in-house expertise. For example, if you have 
administrators and IT staff who can easily manage business applications running 
on a Microsoft Windows platform, then your choice could be to go with a Windows 
operating system. For some companies it is based on the integration requirements 
with the existing systems.
If you do not have any preferences, I would recommend you to go with the Linux 
operating system for production use. Linux source code is freely distributed. Tens of 
thousands of programmers have reviewed the source code to improve performance, 
eliminate bugs, and strengthen security. No other operating system has ever 
undergone this level of review. The key advantages of Linux are listed below:
• 
The best technical support available
• 
No vendor lock-in
• 
Runs on a wide range of hardware
• 
Exceptionally stable
• 
Supports many tools and applications you need
• 
Interoperates with many other types of computer systems
• 
Low total cost of ownership
Databases: MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, 
PostgreSQL
The data access layer of Alfresco is implemented using an open source software 
component and ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool called Hibernate. 
Hibernate abstracts the database layer and provides seamless integration between 
the Alfresco repository and any relational database.
If the Microsoft Windows operating system is the OS of choice, then the natural 
choice for you can be MS SQL Server. If you already have an Oracle license, then 
Oracle database is also an option. Alfresco also supports the PostgreSQL database.

[ 28 ]
If you do not have any database preference, it is recommended that you go with 
the MySQL database, which costs nothing if you go with the open source version. 
The MySQL database has become the world's most popular open source database 
because of its consistency, fast performance, high reliability, and ease of usability. 
It's used in more than 10 million installations ranging from large corporations 
to specialized embedded applications. MySQL runs on more than 20 platforms, 
including Linux, Windows, OS/X, HP-UX, AIX, and Netware, giving you the kind of 
flexibility that puts you in control.
Application Servers: Tomcat, JBoss
Alfresco runs on any J2SE 5.0-compliant application server. Hence there are no 
application server-specific dependencies. However, it is important to make a choice 
of application server before moving into production.
Alfresco uses the Spring framework and not the Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 
framework. So there is no dependency on JBoss or any other application server, 
which provides EJB container. Spring is an open source application framework for 
Java/JEE. The Alfresco repository uses the Spring Framework as the core foundation 
of its architecture. If you are developing a standalone application, then Tomcat might 
be a good option. Apache Tomcat powers numerous large-scale and mission-critical 
web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations. It is the most 
widely-accepted web application server in the market.
On the other hand you must consider using the JBoss application server, which has 
the highest market capture (> 35 percent) in J2EE-based application servers in the 
world. JBoss internally uses Tomcat and hence you get the benefits of Tomcat servlet 
engine as well.
Alfresco utilizes JBoss cache's ability to distribute and maintain data caches, making 
it possible to build large-scale systems that outperform traditional enterprise 
content management systems. Alfresco also utilizes the clustering, failover, and load 
balancing facilities of the JBoss application server to increase scalability. Alfresco's 
business process management features are powered by the JBoss jBPM tool.
If you have already invested in JBoss, then Alfresco provides complementary 
industry-leading enterprise content management technology to the JBoss enterprise 
middleware system suite.

Portals (optional): JBoss portal, Liferay
It is optional for you to go with a portal of your choice; if you already have an 
enterprise portal, you can integrate Alfresco with it. If you do not have a portal 
in place and you would like to leverage the portal framework, then you can 
consider using either JBoss portal or Liferay portal. Both of these are based on J2EE 
technology; both of them are open source and open standards-based and both of 
them have Alfresco built-in support.
JBoss Portal provides an open source platform for hosting and serving a portal's 
web interface, publishing and managing its content, and customizing its experience. 
Although most packaged portal frameworks help enterprises launch portals more 
quickly, only JBoss Portal delivers the benefits of a zero-cost, open source license 
combined with a flexible and scalable underlying platform.
Liferay is the most downloaded and popular open source portal with 40,000 
downloads per month. It runs on top of any J2EE servlet such as Tomcat. So a full 
installation of JBoss is not required, but it can run against most full application 
servers out of the box, including JBoss, JRun, BEA, WebLogic, and Orion. It has a  
full set of web service interfaces to the portal. Liferay supports more than 800 
portlets (products) and has a wider adoption in the market.
Choosing a suitable software for your installation
You need to make the best choice of software to install Alfresco. If you do not have any 
specific requirements, you might consider a complete open source stack for production 
usage and go with Alfresco Enterprise Edition on the Linux operating system with a 
MySQL database running on a JBoss application server with Liferay Portal.
The examples in this book were created and tested with the following choice of 
Alfresco installation:
• 
Eclipse
• 
Alfresco Community Edition 
• 
Operating System: Windows XP

Eclipse installation
As we will be using Eclipse as a development tool for this book, in this section we 
will talk about the installation of Eclipse. Download the Eclipse Europa for Java/
J2EE developers from:
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/
downloads/release/europa/winter/eclipse-java-europa-winter-win32.zip.
Configuring the project for development
In this section, we will learn to set up the development environment for any Alfresco 
WCM project. We will see how we can configure a project in Eclipse.
Open Eclipse by double-clicking on the Eclipse icon. It will ask you to select the 
workspace. Create a new folder called bookworkspace and browse to that folder 
when asked for the workspace.
Eclipse will now start. Now we need to set up a new project for the book in Eclipse. 
Go to File | New | Project.
1.	 Select Java | Java Project in the New Project wizard. Click on Next.

4.	 The project named wcmbook will be created with a src folder and the JRE 
library with the required .jar files attached for this project (if JDK is already 
installed on your machine). You can check that in the Package Explorer 
window as shown in the following screenshot:
Configuring the build path
Now you need to configure the build path so that when you create any Java files, it 
can automatically be compiled by Eclipse. For that, make sure the Project | Build 
Automatically option is checked. To configure the build path for the project, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Right-click on project name, that is, wcmbook and select Build Path |  
Add Libraries.
2.	 Select User Library and click on Next.
3.	 Click on the User Libraries button. In the User Libraries screen, click on the 
New button.
4.	 Provide the name of the library as alfresco_lib and click on OK.
5.	 Select that library name and click on Add JARs. Select all the .jar files from 
the Alfresco installed folder, tomcat/lib, and add those to this library. Also 
select all the .jar files from the tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib 
folder and add those to this library. Once done, click on OK.
6.	 Then click on Finish.

Create the following folder structure for the project to store different types of files:
• 
src
°°
<Java classes with package>
•

• 
extension
• 
<configuration files>
•

…
• 
/src: Put all your source Java classes in this folder with respective package 
structure.
• 
/config/alfresco/extension: Place all your extension configuration files 
in this folder.
• 
/config/alfresco/messages: Put Resource Bundle files (properties file) in 
this folder.
• 
/web/jsp: Place any custom or modified JSPs in this folder. It's a best 
practice to create an extension folder inside the jsp folder and put all the 
custom JSPs in that folder.
• 
/web/css: Place any custom or modified CSS files in this folder. It's a best 
practice to create an extension folder inside the css folder and put all the 
custom CSS files in that folder.
• 
/web/images: Place any images that you have modified or newly created in 
this folder.
• 
/web/scripts: Place any custom JavaScript files used by the user interface in 
this folder.

Build process
We will use Apache Ant, which is a Java-based build tool, for building the 
application from Eclipse. 
Why to use a build tool
There are a number of steps required to transform the source into a deployable 
software solution. In general, a build tool allows developers and build managers to 
describe the build process. In a build, some steps may need to be executed before 
others or they may be independent of others. In summary, a build tool provides a 
mechanism to describe the operations and structure of the build process to deploy 
the code.
Integrating Ant with Eclipse
As we are using Eclipse as our development environment, we will learn how we can 
integrate Ant with Eclipse for the build process. First we need to create a new build 
file in Eclipse.
Creating the build.xml file:
1.	 Right-click on project name wcmbook in Package Explorer
2.	 Select New | File
3.	 In the File Name box, type build.xml
4.	 Click on Finish
Enter the targets for Ant Build in this file and save it. You can have build targets for 
compiling the code, packaging the .jar file, and so on. The build file we will use for 
our examples throughout the book will look like:
<project name="Cignex AMP Build File" default="package-jar"  
  basedir=".">
  <property file="build.properties" />
  <target name="clean" description="Cleans Build directory">

2.	 You will see the Ant view at the right-hand side in Eclipse.
3.	 Drag the build.xml file from Package Explorer to this Ant view.
4.	 Double-click on the target you want to run from the Ant view.
Debugging the Alfresco application in an Eclipse 
environment
We can configure Eclipse and start Alfresco in the debugging mode. This will help  
us in debugging the code for the Alfresco application. The steps to configure this are 
as follows:
1.	 Modify catalina.bat available at <alfresco_home>\tomcat\bin to add 
the following line for DEBUG_OPTS=:
set DEBUG_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,susp
end=n,address=8888
2.	 Now in Eclipse, navigate to Windows | Open perspective | Other | Debug, 
which will open the debug perspective.
3.	 Click on Run | Open Debug Dialog | Remote Java Application |  
New configuration.

Installing the Alfresco WAR on any platform
Use the Web Archive (WAR) file to install Alfresco on any platform. A WAR file 
is a JAR file used to distribute a collection of files (JavaServer Pages, servlets, Java 
classes, XML files, tag libraries, and static web pages) that together constitute a  
web application.
Use this method of installing Alfresco if you already have installed a JDK, a 
supported database, an application server, and the additional Alfresco components. 
The WAR zip includes the binaries for ImageMagick and pdf2swf. To download and 
install the Alfresco WAR file you need to carry out the following:
1.	 Browse to the Alfresco Community Edition download area.
2.	 Select and download one of the following files:
alfresco-community-war-3.2.zip
alfresco-community-war-3.2.tar.gz
3.	 Specify a location for the download.
4.	 Extract the downloaded file.
5.	 Copy the alfresco.war file and share.war file to the appropriate location 
for your application server, for example: <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps.
If you deployed previous versions of Alfresco, you must remove any temporary files 
created by your application server.
Modifying the directory paths for Tomcat 6.x
If you install Tomcat 6.x separately, some of the directories that were present in 
Tomcat 5.x will not be present in the former. For example, Tomcat 6.x does not contain 
the shared/classes and shared/lib directories. Alfresco uses these directories to 
locate some of the configuration override files. This section describes how to configure 
Tomcat 6.x to use the correct directory structure and files for Alfresco:
1.	 Locate <TOMCAT_HOME>.
2.	 Create the shared/classes directory.
3.	 Open the <TOMCAT-HOME>/conf/catalina.properties file.
4.	 Change the value shared.loader= to the following:
shared.loader=${catalina.base}/shared/classes,${catalina.base}/
shared/lib/*.jar
5.	 Copy the JDBC drivers for the database you are using to lib/.

1.	 Install a new Tomcat instance.
2.	 Modify the /conf/server.xml file for the new Tomcat instance as follows:
a.	 Change the port number in the line (for example, to 8006):
<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
b.	 Change the port number in the section (for example, to 8180):
<!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 -->
<Connector port="8080" ....

Compiling and deploying the customizations on top 
of the WCM core
We already talked about the build process for the code deployment in the previous 
sections. So we have the build file ready and now we will see how we can deploy 
the code or customizations we have done for Alfresco WCM. There are two main 
approaches for this.
Integrating the code in the existing Alfresco WAR file
In this approach, we will integrate the files directly in the alfresco.war file. For 
this you need to run the integrate-extension target. This target has some dependent 
targets, which will compile the Java source files. Make the JAR file and then package 
everything in one ZIP file and then integrate it with the alfresco.war file.
Deploying the code as an AMP
AMP stands for Alfresco Module Package. Using this approach, you can install  
the code as a module. If you are installing using AMP, you should follow the  
folder-specific folder structure for that, which has already been described earlier  
in the Source code tree section. Apart from the folder structure, there are two other 
files that need to be created:
• 
module.properties: This will specify the metadata of the module with the 
ID and version number.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Installation and Configuration
[ 58 ]
The sample module.properties file that we have used here will look like:
# Cignex module
module.id=Cignex
module.title=Cignex Website
module.description=Cignex Website module
module.version=1.0
• 
file-mapping.xml: This file will be used if you want to customize the way 
in which your AMP file is mapped into the WAR. If it is not provided, then 
the default mapping information will be used.
Here we have customized this for the WEB-INF folder, which generally 
contains the faces-config-custom.xml or any faces-related  
configuration files.
The content for file-mapping.xml file is:
# Custom AMP to WAR location mappings
/web/WEB-INF=/WEB-INF
For deploying the code as an AMP, you need to run the update-war target. This 
target has some dependent targets, which will compile the Java source files. Make 
the JAR file and then create an AMP package with all of the customized files and 
finally install this AMP to the Alfresco WAR file and update the WAR file.
Installing OpenOffice
Within Alfresco, you can transform a document from one format to another, for 
example, a text file to a PDF file. To have access to these transformation facilities in 
Alfresco, you must install OpenOffice. This is optional and can be done any time 
after Alfresco is installed. If you installed Alfresco using an installation wizard, 
OpenOffice may already be installed.

13.	 Modify the ooo.exe= property in the <classPathRoot>\alfresco-
global.properties file to point to the OpenOffice binary office.exe.
Installing ImageMagick
To enable image manipulation in Alfresco, you must install and configure 
ImageMagick. Alfresco uses ImageMagick to manipulate images for previewing. If 
you installed Alfresco using one of the installation wizards, ImageMagick has already 
been installed. If however, ImageMagick has not been installed, you can choose to do 
so by downloading it and installing it to work with your Alfresco instance.

1.	 Verify if ImageMagick is already installed in your system. You can run the 
convert command, which is part of ImageMagick and is usually located in  
/usr/bin.
2.	 If ImageMagick is not in your system, browse to the ImageMagick download 
site and install the appropriate package for your platform.
3.	 Modify the img.root= and img.exe= properties in the <classPathRoot>/
alfrescoglobal.properties file to point to the ImageMagick root directory. 
For example, in Windows:
°°
Set the img.root= property to img.root=C:/Alfresco/ImageMagick.
°°
Set the img.exe= property to img.exe=C:/Alfresco/ImageMagick/
bin/convert.exe.
And for Linux:
°°
Set the img.root= property to img.root=/ImageMagick.
°°
Set the img.exe= property to img.exe=/ImageMagick/bin/
convert.exe.
°°
Ensure that you do not include a slash (/) at the end of the path. For 
example, /ImageMagick/.
Installing Microsoft Office add-ins
This task describes how to install Alfresco Add-ins for Microsoft® Office 
applications, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The Alfresco add-ins have been 
designed with Microsoft Office 2003 in mind. However, they are also compatible 
with Microsoft Office 2007. Before you start, make sure that:
• 
The .NET Programmability Support option is installed for each of the Office 
applications that you are installing the add-ins in (such as Word, Excel, 
and PowerPoint). To find these options, run the Office Setup program and 
expand the list of available options for each application. You may require 
your original Office 2003 install media to add these required components.
• 
The installing user has Windows administrator privileges.
• 
Any Microsoft Office applications on your system are NOT running, 
including Outlook if you use Word as an e-mail editor. If you are running 
Office 2007 on Windows Vista, note that Microsoft has rewritten the 
WebDAV parts of Vista, which means you will experience READ-ONLY 
access to the Alfresco repository over WebDAV. This is a known problem 
with Vista and affects many applications, including Microsoft's own 
SharePoint Server. There is no known workaround at the time of writing. 
CIFS access is unaffected and works as it does with Windows XP. Therefore, 
use CIFS to obtain read/write access to Alfresco using Windows Vista.

Installation and Configuration
[ 62 ]
Now proceed to the following steps:
1.	 Browse to the Alfresco Community Edition download area.
2.	 Run the Microsoft setup file:
alfresco-community-office2003-addins-3.2.zip.
3.	 This example refers to the Office installer that installs all three add-ins.  
You can also use individual installers to add Alfresco to one of the three 
Office applications.
4.	 These individual installers are:
alfresco-community-word2003-addin-3.2.zip
alfresco-community-excel2003-addin-3.2.zip
alfresco-community-powerpoint2003-addin-3.2.zip
5.	 Run setup.exe.
6.	 If required, the setup program will download the required components from  
the Microsoft website. These components are .NET 2.0 Framework and Visual 
Studio 2005 Tools for Office Second Edition runtime. The setup is complete.
7.	 Run the Office application, for example, run Word.
8.	 A welcome window with configuration options is displayed. You can return 
to the configuration options at any time using the link at the bottom of the 
add-in window.
9.	 In the Web Client URL field, enter the location of Alfresco Explorer.
For example: http://server:8080/alfresco/.
10.	 In the WebDAV URL field, append webdav/ to the Alfresco Explorer URL.
For example: http://server:8080/alfresco/webdav/.
11.	 In the CIFS Server field, enter the path to the CIFS server. The add-in will try 
to auto-complete this value, but you should verify for the correct address.
For example: \\server_a\alfresco\ or \\servera\alfresco\.
12.	 If you intend to use the CIFS interface to save documents via the add-in, 
it is very important that you are authenticated automatically. Limitations 
in the Microsoft Office APIs mean that an error is shown instead of an 
authentication dialog box if the Alfresco CIFS interface rejects your 
connection attempt. If you are not in an Enterprise environment, where it 
may not be possible to configure automatic authentication, you can map a 
network drive to the Alfresco CIFS interface instead.
13.	 In the Authentication area, enter your Alfresco username and password.

Chapter 2
[ 63 ]
14.	 The add-in will always try to automatically log you into Alfresco in order 
to present your checked out documents and your assigned tasks. If you 
are using the CIFS interface, authentication is usually automatic. However, 
sometimes the add-in needs to present your Alfresco username and 
password for authentication. It is recommended that you enter and save your 
Alfresco credentials. All values are stored in the Windows registry and your 
password is encrypted against casual hacking attempts.
15.	 Click on Save Settings.
Installing Flash Player
Alfresco Share uses the Flash Player for viewing Flash previews and also when you 
use the multi-file upload facility. This is optional and may be installed after you have 
installed Alfresco.
1.	 Browse to the Adobe Flash Player download website: http://www.adobe.
com/products/flashplayer.
2.	 Download the latest (stable) version of Flash Player for your platform.
3.	 Browse to the location of your downloaded file and install the application.
4.	 A wizard guides you through the installation.
5.	 When the installation is complete, click on Close.
Installing SWFTools
Alfresco Share uses the pdf2swf utility of the SWFTools for previewing PDF files. 
The pdf2swf utility generates one frame per page of fully-formatted text inside a 
Flash movie. To install the pdf2swf utility, you must install the complete SWFTools. 
This is optional and may be installed after you have installed Alfresco.
Installing SWFTools on Windows
Follow these steps to install SWFTools on Windows:
1.	 Browse to the SWFTools website: http://www.swftools.org/.
2.	 Download the latest (stable) version of the SWFTools for your platform. The

Installing TinyMCE language packs
Translations in Alfresco use the language pack supplied in the default bundle.  
This default bundle includes English (en), French (fr), German (de), Japanese (jp), 
Spanish (es), and Italian (it). If you have a translation that is not supplied with 
Alfresco, then you must add the appropriate TinyMCE language pack for the 
translation to work correctly.
If you installed Alfresco using one of the installation wizards or bundles, the 
default language packs are already installed. You can also download and install the 
language packs from the TinyMCE website.
1.	 Browse to the TinyMCE website: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/
download_i18n.php.
2.	 Download the required TinyMCE language pack.
3.	 Unpack the language file:
°°
For Share, unpack to: <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/share/modules/
editors/tiny_mce.
°°
For Explorer, unpack to: <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/alfresco/
scripts/tiny_mce.
4.	 Ensure that the browser cache is cleared or refresh the page.
Installing an Alfresco Module Package
An Alfresco Module Package (AMP) is a bundle of code, content model, content, and 
the directory structure that is used to distribute additional functionality for Alfresco. 
This section describes how to install an AMP in an Alfresco WAR using the Module 
Management Tool (MMT). The MMT is used to install and manage AMP files, and 
it is included in the Alfresco installers. The MMT is also available as a separately 
downloadable JAR file from the Alfresco release download area (alfresco-mmt-
3.2.jar).
For Tomcat, alternatively, run the apply_amps.bat command, which is in the root 
Alfresco directory. This batch file applies all of the AMP files that are located in the 
amps directory. You can verify the correctness of installation of AMP as follows:
1.	 Browse to the /bin directory:
°°
Windows: C:\Alfresco\bin
°°
Linux: /opt/alfresco/bin
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 2
[ 67 ]
2.	 Run the following command:
java -jar alfresco-mmt.jar install <AMPFileLocation> 
<WARFileLocation>[options]
Where:
Option 
Description
<AMPFileLocation> 
The location of the AMP file that you want to install.
<WARFileLocation> 
The location of the WAR file for your Alfresco installation.
-verbose 
Install command [options]. Enables detailed output containing 
what is being updated and to where it is being copied.
-directory 
Install command [options]. Indicates that the AMP file location 
specified is a directory. All AMP files found in the directory and 
its sub-directories are installed.
-force 
Install command [options]. Forces installation of AMP regardless 
of currently installed module version.
-preview 
Install command [options]. Previews installation of AMP 
without modifying the WAR file. It reports the modifications that 
will occur on the WAR without making any physical changes, 
for example, the changes that will update existing files. It is a 
good practice to use this option before installing the AMP.
-nobackup 
Indicates that the WAR will not be backed up before the AMP  
is installed.
3.	 This command installs the files found in the AMP into the Alfresco WAR. If 
the module represented by the AMP is already installed and the installing 
AMP is of a higher release version, then the files for the older version are 
removed from the WAR and replaced with the newer files. The following 
command shows an example of how to install the example-amp.amp, and 
assumes that the AMP file is in the same directory as WAR file:
java -jar alfresco-mmt.jar install example-amp.amp alfresco.war 
-preview
4.	 Review the modification to check the changes that will update any  
existing files.
www.it-ebooks.info

Installation and Configuration
[ 68 ]
5.	 The following example will install the AMP file:
java -jar alfresco-mmt.jar install example-amp.amp alfresco.war 
-verbose
6.	 The modified Alfresco WAR can then be redeployed back into your 
application server. On restarting the application server, the console will show 
that the custom class was initialized during startup.
7.	 Verify that the AMP is installed using the MMT list command. For example:
java -jar alfresco-mmt.jar list <WARFileLocation>
8.	 This command provides a detailed listing of all of the modules currently 
installed in the specified WAR file. When the repository is next started, the 
installed module configuration will be detected, and the repository will be 
bootstrapped to include the new module functionality and data. It is not 
recommended that you overwrite an existing file in an AMP; however, it is 
sometimes necessary. The MMT makes a backup copy of the updated file 
and stores it in the WAR. When an update of the module occurs and the old 
files are removed, this backup will be restored prior to the installation of the 
new files. Problems may occur if multiple installed modules modify the same 
existing file. In these cases, a manual restore may be necessary if recovery 
to an existing state is required. Some application servers (notably Tomcat) 
do not always fully clean up their temporary working files and this can 
interfere with successful installation of an AMP file. To remedy this situation, 
it is recommended that you delete (or move) the Tomcat work and temp 
directories while Tomcat is shut down.
Installing Microsoft Office SharePoint Protocol 
Support
The Microsoft Office SharePoint Protocol Support offers Microsoft users greater 
choice by providing a fully-compatible SharePoint repository that allows the 
Microsoft Office Suite applications (for example, Word, PowerPoint, Excel) to 
interact with Alfresco as if it was SharePoint. This enables your users to leverage the 
Alfresco repository directly from Microsoft Office.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 2
[ 69 ]
You can also use Microsoft Office SharePoint Protocol Support to enable online editing 
for Office documents within Alfresco Share. It enables your users to modify Office files 
without checking them in and out. Alfresco locks the file while it is being modified and 
releases the lock when the file is saved and closed. The following diagram shows the 
architecture of the SharePoint Protocol Support in relation to an Alfresco installation.
The SharePoint Protocol Support architecture embeds a Jetty web server within the 
Alfresco repository. Microsoft Office clients communicate directly with the Jetty 
server using WebDAV-like calls with proprietary extensions and on a different port 
number from Alfresco Share. This port number can be configured in the SharePoint 
Protocol Support properties files.
Installing the SharePoint Protocol Support AMP
The SharePoint Protocol support functionality is installed from an Alfresco AMP. 
If you use the Windows or Linux installers to install Alfresco, the SharePoint 
Protocol Support is installed by default. These instructions describe how to install 
the SharePoint Protocol Support into the Alfresco WAR. When you install this file, 
it responds to the SharePoint requests from Office, and therefore allows Alfresco to 
appear as the SharePoint server.
If you installed Alfresco using an installation wizard, 
the SharePoint Protocol may already be installed.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Installation and Configuration
[ 70 ]
Follow the steps listed below to apply the SharePoint AMP to your Alfresco instance:
1.	 Shut down your Alfresco server.
2.	 Browse to the Enterprise download area.
3.	 Browse to the Alfresco Community Edition download area.
4.	 Download the vti-module.amp file.
5.	 Move the file to the amps directory.
6.	 Install the vti-module.amp file into the alfresco.war file using the Module 
Management Tool (MMT). The vti-module.amp file holds the functionality for 
the SharePoint connector. For Tomcat, alternatively, run the apply_amps.bat 
command, which is in the root Alfresco directory. This batch file applies all of 
the AMPS that are located in the amps directory.
7.	 Start your Alfresco server to expand the directory structure.
8.	 Verify that you have applied the SharePoint AMP to Alfresco by checking 
that you have the following directory:
/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/ 
alfresco/module/org.alfresco.module.vti/context
Configuring SharePoint Protocol Support
The SharePoint Protocol Support functionality uses the properties in the default 
configuration file called vti.properties in <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/alfresco/
WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/module/org.alfresco.module.vti/context.
Custom properties and overrides can be set in the alfresco-global.properties 
file. Ensure that you have applied the SharePoint Protocol Support AMP. This can be 
done and verified as follows:
1.	 Open the alfresco-global.properties file.
2.	 Add the following properties:
vti.server.port=7070
vti.alfresco.deployment.context=/alfresco
vti.alfresco.alfresoHostWithPort=http://your-host:8080

installation scripts in the alfresco directory calls the sub-scripts in this 
folder to start the sub-Alfresco Tomcat component of the installation, creating 
and setting up the permissions for the Alfresco MySQL database. This folder 
is very useful for people going for the manual installation rather than using 
an installer.
• 
extras: Contains additional files such as space template for records 
management file plan, which can be imported into the Alfresco repository.
• 
java: As is evident by the name, it contains the Java Development Kit.  
All of the Alfresco development is done using Java as the core  
programming language.
• 
licenses: This directory contains the licenses for Alfresco, MySQL, Apache, 
and licenses for the other third-party applications used inside Alfresco.

• 
tomcat: Again, as evident from the name, this directory holds the Tomcat 
installation where the Alfresco application is deployed as a WAR file. You 
can see the alfresco.war and share.war files in the webapps sub-folder of 
this directory.
• 
openoffice: This directory contains the entire portable Office suite 
installation that is used for word processing, spread sheet processing,  
and so on.
• 
virtual-tomcat: This folder contains the customized Tomcat, which is used 
for previewing the files in the WCM.
• 
The README file gives information about using CIFS and some 
troubleshooting tips.
You can uninstall the program by clicking on the uninstall.exe application.
Configuring Alfresco as a Windows service
You can also configure Alfresco as a Windows service in a standard Alfresco/Tomcat 
Installation. With the default installation, Alfresco is bundled as a web application 
that launches within Tomcat. To configure Alfresco to run as a Windows service, you 
need to set up Tomcat to run as a Windows service.
To configure Alfresco as a Windows service:
1.	 Open a command prompt.
2.	 Go to the <alfresco_installation_folder>/tomcat/bin directory.
3.	 Use the following commands:
service.bat install alfresco
tomcat5.exe //US//alfresco --DisplayName "Alfresco Server"
tomcat5.exe //US//alfresco --JvmMs=256 --JvmMx=512 --JvmSs=64
tomcat5.exe //US//alfresco --JavaHome=<alfresco_installation_
folder>/java
tomcat5.exe //US//alfresco --Environment ALF_HOME=<alfresco_
installation_folder>/
tomcat5.exe //US//alfresco --Environment PATH=<alfresco_
installation_folder>/bin;%PATH%
tomcat5.exe //US//alfresco --StartPath <alfresco_installation_
folder>--Startup auto
4.	 To uninstall the service, go to the <alfresco_installation_folder>/
tomcat/bin and enter the following command:
service.bat uninstall alfresco

Installation and Configuration
[ 78 ]
5.	 To edit your service settings, navigate to <alfresco_installation_
folder>/tomcat/bin and enter the following command:
tomcat5w.exe //ES//alfresco
6.	 To start the service, locate the service named Alfresco Server in your 
Windows Service control panel and start Alfresco from this control panel.
Summary
In this chapter we learned:
• 
Alfresco can be installed using a number of different methods as per  
your preference.
• 
You can install Alfresco as a standard Web Archive (WAR) file to deploy on 
your existing application server, or as a bundle that includes a preconfigured 
Tomcat server, the Alfresco WAR (alfresco.war), batch files, database setup 
scripts, and a sample extensions folder.
• 
The various flavors of installations mentioned in this chapter are aimed 
to help you select what is best suited for your purpose and optimize your 
development experience with Alfresco WCM.
The next chapter will take you through creating web forms and web projects and the 
various aspects. You shall also learn about creating, editing, and updating content 
and the Advanced Versioning Manager.

Web project Sandboxes
Before you delve into the details of web projects, it is worthwhile to understand the 
concept of sandboxes.
• 
Each user in a web project is provided their own sandbox.
• 
Each web project has a Staging Sandbox. All user changes, such as uploading 
a file in the system, are stored in their sandbox until they are submitted to the 
Staging Sandbox.
• 
The User Sandbox also maps all files in the Staging Sandbox, which have not 
been modified by the current user, providing a complete view of the web 
project for that specific user with their current changes.
• 
The Staging Sandbox has all files submitted by each user, where the current 
view is the most recently submitted version of a specific file.
The following diagram illustrates what user Mark sees with no modified file in his 
sandbox. Note how he sees the Staging Sandbox's version of Index.html:
Mark creates or uploads a new products page. He will see the new Products.html 
file and the staging's version of the Index.html file.

Chapter 3
[ 83 ]
Now Mark modifies the Index.html file to link to the Products.html file. This 
creates a new version of the Index.html file in his sandbox. He no longer sees the 
current Staging Sandbox's version of the file as illustrated in the following diagram:
Mark is satisfied with his changes and submits them through workflow and the two 
files are promoted to staging. His versions of the Index.html and Products.html 
files become the Staging Sandbox's current versions as shown in the next diagram:

User Sandbox interface
The following screenshot shows the WCM interface for the user's sandbox at the 
bottom and the Staging Sandbox at the top:
Using this interface users can:
• 
Browse their sandbox and the Staging Sandbox web project hierarchy using 
the appropriate Browse Website action.
• 
Preview the website based on the state of their sandbox or the Staging 
Sandbox using the appropriate Preview Website action.
• 
Submit all modified files from their sandbox to a workflow using the Submit 
All action.
• 
Roll back all modified files in their sandbox using the Undo All action.
• 
Refresh their sandbox or the Staging Sandbox using the appropriate Refresh 
action. This is useful to view a new file submitted in another fashion (CIFS) 
in the user's sandbox, or new submission in the Staging Sandbox from  
other users.

Advanced Versioning Manager (AVM)
Sandboxes are backed by the Advanced Versioning Manager (AVM). The AVM 
is an advanced repository implementation designed to support the version 
control requirements of large websites and web applications. It is a completely 
different implementation from the stores used by Alfresco Document and Records 
Management. Think of the AVM as a virtual time machine. For example, if you want 
to look at how a particular file appeared one month ago, you will be able to see it 
against the backdrop of how everything else looked one month ago. The state of 
the entire repository will be recorded in an efficient manner at each moment in its 
transaction history. The AVM provides the following features, including some found 
in other software tools like Subversion and TeamSite:
• 
Directories, renames, and file metadata will be versioned
• 
Every moment in transaction history is available immediately as a  
read-only filesystem
• 
All directories are first-class versioned objects
• 
Branching will be a constant-time operation
• 
Choice of database backends (for example, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL)
• 
Access through CIFS
Alfresco AVM is an advanced store implementation designed to support the version 
control requirements of managing large websites and web applications. The AVM 
consists of a forest of content stores that can be used to manage the development 
and staging of web content and associated source code. Each AVM store is loosely 
modeled on Subversion, providing source code control for websites. Each AVM store 
supports an extended versioning model, including:
• 
File-level version control
• 
File-level branching
• 
Directory-level version control
• 
Directory-level branching
• 
Store-level version control (snapshots)
• 
Store-level branching
www.it-ebooks.info

[ 86 ]
In addition to these extended versioning operations, the AVM also supports the 
following capabilities:
File version comparison
• 
Between two file versions on the same branch within a single store
• 
Between two file versions on different branches within the same store
• 
Between two file versions between any two stores
Directory version comparison
• 
Between two directory versions on the same branch within a single store
• 
Between two directory versions on different branches within the same store
• 
Between two directory versions between any two stores
Store version comparison
• 
Between two versions of any single store
• 
Between any two stores
AVM's support for file, directory, and store comparison provides the basis for 
synchronization operations, for example, to synchronize any two branched versions 
of a source tree within an AVM store or maintained in separate AVM stores.
The web project
A web project contains all of the content and assets (files and images) required for the 
website(s). All actions for managing a specific website, creating content, uploading 
assets, reviewing and previewing content, workflows, managing web forms, 
managing rendering templates, and publishing are associated to a web project.
Create the web project
To create a new web project, go to the Company Home | Web Projects space, select 
the Create drop-down menu and click on the Create Web Project link as shown in 
the following screenshot:

Summary
Review the summary screen and click on the Finish button once you are fine with 
the information provided in the summary.
You can always add or modify the web project details at any given point of time.
The new web project appears in the Web Projects space. Completing the wizard 
automatically creates a source repository called a Staging Sandbox, and a set of 
development repositories called User Sandboxes. There is one User Sandbox for 
each user invited to work on the project, as well as an administrator sandbox.
Creating a site easily with web project
In this section we shall see how we can easily create a website with a web project. For 
this we will use an existing ROOT folder, and import it into the web projects folder. 
The details of creating a website from scratch are given in the subsequent chapters of 
the book.

Listing User Sandboxes
On clicking on the web project, the sandbox view appears displaying the Staging 
and User Sandboxes. Each User Sandbox contains the existing web project content. 
The sandbox labeled My Sandbox belongs to the currently logged in user (in this 
case, the administrator). As the administrator, you have access to the sandboxes of all 
users associated with the web project.
By default, only the Staging Sandbox and the User Sandbox display; however, you 
can select the Show All Sandboxes option in this view to display all the sandboxes 
available to you, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Getting Started with Alfresco WCM
[ 94 ]
Refresh your browser page to view all the User Sandboxes if the browser is not  
refreshed automatically.
You cannot add the content directly to the Staging Sandbox. Here is the process you 
need to follow in order to create the content.
1.	 Create content in your User Sandbox either by uploading the files or using 
bulk import feature.
2.	 Preview the content to ensure the accuracy.
3.	 Optionally verify the broken links using the links checker.
4.	 Submit the approved content to the Staging Sandbox.
5.	 Deploy the content from Staging Sandbox to external servers using the 
filesystem deployer.
Add content to the web project
There are multiple methods of adding and creating content for a web project. In 
addition to creating web content within a project, you can also upload individual 
files from your computer or perform a bulk import of a ZIP file with web project 
contents as shown in the following screenshot:
When you install WCM, you will also get sample files to create web projects. Refer to 
the file alfresco-sample-website.war, which is provided as a default example in 
the Alfresco bundle, from c:\alfresco\extras\wcm.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 3
[ 95 ]
To bulk import content of this file, select Bulk Import in the Create menu. Use the 
Browse button to locate and upload the alfresco-sample-website.war file. Once 
uploaded, click on OK to begin the import.
The .war file, which you imported into the current directory (the ROOT webapp), 
appears in expanded form in your User Sandbox.
If you don't have the sample .war file, then add few sample files to your User 
Sandbox from your local computer using the Add Content option. In the Alfresco 
WCM, a lock is automatically placed on content items created, imported, modified, 
or deleted, in order to prevent editing clashes. In our sandbox, notice that all of the 
items (not folders) currently display a padlock icon with a key (
). This indicates 
that you own the lock and can perform actions on the content. A lock owned by 
another user appears as a plain padlock (
). You can position the mouse cursor 
over the icon to display a tooltip indicating the lock owner.
Click on Preview Website in the sandbox header to see the website in its current state.
The preview window displays how the website or web application will look with the 
submitted User Sandbox content. Click on About us and then on News to display 
the empty Alfresco Press Releases page. You will come back to this again later once 
you have added some content.
Close the preview and return to User Sandbox. Click on Project Name in the 
breadcrumb path to return to the sandbox view.
Submit content to the Staging Sandbox
At this point, the web project is populated with content items, some imported 
and some created, some submitted and some not. You must now deal with the 
submission of the remaining items to staging.

Bulk loading of content XML files and previously rendered files (HTML, XML, and 
RSS feeds) will not recreate mapping between source file -> rendering template -> 
output file. This is also the case for bulk uploads into a web project.
There is a Web Projects tool on the Alfresco Forge, but it is for Version 2.2. These 
tools provided import and export features, and re-association of renditions with 
content and templates, among others.
Virtualization server
A Virtualization server is a customized version of Tomcat that treats each User 
Sandbox, Staging Sandbox, and workflow instance as a separate Tomcat web 
application. It understands an "overloaded" hostname format that allows it to map 
requests to specific sandboxes. These "overloaded" hostnames use wildcard DNS 
entries to map all request to the same Alfresco Virtualization server.
Configuring the virtual server for preview
The configuration files for the virtual server can be found in the <alfresco home>/
virtual-tomcat/conf directory. To enable previews on a development machine, 
you need to modify the alfrescovirtserver.properties file to utilize the Alfresco 
wildcard DNS service. The alfresco.virtserv.domain value needs to be updated 
to replace 127-0-0-1 with the IP of the Alfresco local machine, substituting all "."  
with dashes:
# Alfresco's free/public wildcard domain service ("EchoDNS")
# returns resource records with a TTL of 1 day. Therefore,
# the run-time overhead is quite minimal. Once the machine
# has done a name lookup, it will cache the result for the
# next 24 hours (or until you reboot).
#
alfresco.virtserver.domain=127-0-0-1.ip.alfrescodemo.net
If the IP of the Alfresco machine is 192.168.1.25, update alfresco.virtserver.
domain to alfresco.virtserver.domain=192-168-1-25.ip.alfrescodemo.net.
Alfresco Virtual Server needs to be restarted at this point.
Virtualization URL format
The general format for Alfresco virtual hyperlink is:
http://virtual-hostname.www--sandbox.virtualization-domain:port/
request-path

where the virtual-hostname is defined as the DNS name when creating a web 
project, and the virtualization-domain is the wildcarded domain name entry 
that maps to the Alfresco Virtualization Server. The default port for a virtualization 
server is 8180. Given that a web project was created with "test" as the DNS name, 
(*.virtualserver.unico.com is a DNS entry for Virtualization Server) and is 
installed on the default port, the following are true:
• 
http://unicom.www--sandbox.virtualserver.unico.com:8180/ is the 
preview of the Unicom web project for the Staging Sandbox.
• 
http://admin.unicom.www--sandbox.virtualserver.unico.com:8180/ 
is the preview of the root of the Unicom web project for the admin user's 
sandbox.
• 
http://jsmith.unicom.www--sandbox.virtualserver.unico.com:8180/
index.html is the preview of the file /index.html of the web project in  
the jsmith user's sandbox. There are variations of this for previewing  
new content before the initial persistence and previews for items within  
a workflow.
Virtualization server access to the User 
Sandbox
The AVM repository and its virtual stores are mapped into the virtual Tomcat 
working directory:
$VIRTUAL_TOMCAT_HOME/work/Catalina/avm.alfresco.localhost/.
This working directory will contain directories like the following, which are similar 
to the naming CIFS convention for virtual stores:
TABLE[
$-1$mysite--admin--preview$ROOT/ $-1$silly--admin--preview$ROOT/
$-1$mysite--admin$ROOT/ $-1$silly--admin$ROOT/
$-1$mysite--alice--preview$ROOT/ $-1$silly--alice--preview$ROOT/

Virtual server configuration
Configure the virtual server to allow the previewing of content and review some 
of the content in the CIGNEX web project in the user's sandbox. Once you are 
satisfied that the preview is working, submit the whole project to staging. After the 
submission is complete, preview the website in the Staging Sandbox.
1.	 Determine the current IP of the Alfresco machine using one of the following:
°°
Windows—open CMD prompt and run the ipconfig command
°°
Unix(s)—open terminal and run ipconfig -a
2.	 Open the virtserver.properties file found in the <alfresco home>/
virtual-tomcat/conf directory.
c:\Alfresco\virtual-tomcat\conf\virtserver.properties
3.	 Modify the following line to use the IP found in step one, replacing  
all "." with "-" :
alfresco.virtserver.domain=127-0-0-1.ip.alfrescodemo.net
For IP of 192.168.1.100 the line would be:
alfresco.virtserver.domain=192-168-1-100.ip.alfrescodemo.net
4.	 Save and exit the file.
5.	 Start or restart the Virtual Server.
6.	 Test previewing the file in the user's sandbox.
Click on Submit All to send all files to the staging environment. Test preview in the 
Staging Sandbox. Previewing in the User and Staging Sandboxes should work.
Dynamic websites using WCM
A web project it not limited to just static files. Web projects can include server-side 
scripting files including JSP, PHP, CF, or Python files. In the end, these files would 
be published to the appropriate application server or web server enabled to evaluate 
these files. Specifically for Java, Alfresco supports the evaluation of JSPs and exploded 
WARs within a web project with support for preview of JSPs by the Virtual Server.
You could upload archived WARs, have Alfresco deploy them to a web application 
server for unpacking, and so on. For Tomcat, it could place them in the  
webapps directory.

Getting Started with Alfresco WCM
[ 102 ]
Virtual server JSP support
Create a simple "hello world" JSP, load it up, and test. The JSP will evaluate without 
creating the WEB-INF and web.xml files. But more complex WARs will need WEB-INF 
and web.xml files for Tomcat to evaluate.
Previewing WARs and getRealPath()
For JSP and Java code that use the getRealPath() method or the filesystem path 
for a file, Alfresco requires additional configuration for the virtual server preview to 
function. This is the case for Spring-based web applications, where configuration and 
properties files are required to be read on startup.
To enable preview in this case, Alfresco needs to be modified to:
• 
Enable Alfresco to use CIFS (refer Chapter 2 for details)
• 
Mount the CIFS directory
• 
Have the virtual server mount the AVM CIFS projection
Virtual server configuration
The virtual server needs to be configured to mount the new drive. Follow these steps:
1.	 Open up the alfresco-virtserver.properties file in the directory:
c:\Alfresco\virtualtomcat\conf.
2.	 Locate the following section:
#
# On Windows, the ".unix" properties are ignored.
# On Linux, the ".win" properties are ignored.
#
alfresco.virtserver.cifs.avm.versiontree.win=v
alfresco.virtserver.cifs.avm.versiontree.unix=/media/alfresco/
cifs/v
3.	 Modify alfresco.virtserver.cifs.avm.versiontree.win=v to use the 
drive letter "Z" used above when mapping to the CIFS server, as follows:
alfresco.virtserver.cifs.avm.versiontree.win=z:.

Search
Searching against a WCM store is the same as searching against a full repository. 
However, the scope of the search will be limited to that web project only.
A search against an AVM store can be performed via Java, JavaScript, FreeMarker 
template, or the node browser. It is not yet exposed via open search. As the API is 
the same, searches via web services or something similar are the same apart from the 
store context.
Search is only available for the latest snapshot of the head revision for staging. It is 
not available for User Sandboxes, workflow sandboxes, and so on. In a lot of cases, 
the design principle followed is to use Lucene queries minimally in your project. 
Other methods such as navigating via AVM Paths and others to get hold of the 
content you are trying to search can suffice in such a scenario.
Summary
Alfresco tracks all content modifications made within a user's sandbox and maintains 
those changes in isolation from other user's working within their own sandbox 
environment. In this way, large teams of users can work independently on changes 
to the website without stepping over one another's work.
Sandboxed development, along with virtualization and in-context preview, means 
that a large, diverse web team can easily collaborate on changes to the website with 
reduced risk and higher overall quality.
The next chapter will explain in detail the concepts we have covered in this chapter. 
Creation of web forms from scratch, web projects, and content creation using the 
same is explained in great detail. It will take you through concepts of templating, 
associating templates with web projects, dashlets, dynamic content, and so on.

Web Content Production with 
Web Forms
In the previous chapter, we learned about creation of a web project. To set up a 
website you must have both web forms and a web project. Web forms provide the 
facility to manage content through a user-friendly and technology-neutral (as much 
as possible) interface. It allows you to separate content from code and presentation 
logic. It allows non-technical content owners to manage, approve, and deploy their 
own web content. Static content is required for a few websites. However, for many 
sites, dynamic and flashy content is required. Dynamic content can be managed 
easily with web forms, as content can be created once and rendered in many formats. 
In this chapter, you will learn about basic and advanced web form concepts and the 
ways to extend it as per your business requirements.
By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to:
• 
Create web forms
• 
Create rendition templates
• 
Create FreeMarker templates
• 
Create Extensible Stylesheet Language transformations
• 
Associate web forms and renditions for specific or multiple projects
• 
Update web forms and rendition templates
• 
Create dynamic content 
• 
Create web publishing dashlets

Web Content Production with Web Forms
[ 106 ]
Why web forms
Consider a website, say, www.cignex.com, which has some primary sections, such as 
news, blogs, events, trainings, and solutions. The news, blog, and training elements 
have to be updated every month. Let's assume that in the structure of news element 
there should be a title, news headline, sub headline, page content, image, image 
title, and news date. For each content of the news, you must have these elements. To 
update these sections, each time you have to create new HTML/JSP files from scratch. 
This becomes quite clumsy. We need a way to manage it easily. Assume the concept 
where the structure is in place and you have to just put in the content. The concept 
can be called web forms. Another important thing to focus on is the fact that web 
forms are always stored in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format. Using web 
scripts, you can extract the web content (which is in XML format) and serve external 
applications. Thus you can consider the user interface to be in various technologies 
that will enable content to be used for various purposes wherever required. Content 
can be transactionally deployed to static content servers or Alfresco runtime 
repositories, providing complete architectural flexibility for web forms.
These enhanced capabilities make it easier for authorized users to preview and edit 
various file types, including those with multi-language content, before publishing. 
The new capabilities would allow contributors to preview pages rendered with 
different file formats, including HTML, PDF, RTF, XML, and mobile, as well as any 
UTF-8 compatible foreign language formats.
Following are the benefits of web forms:
• 
Easily extensible solutions: This will allow users to separate content from 
code and presentation logic. Thus, content contributors can easily manage 
the website without developer intervention.
• 
You can display the content in various formats.
• 
Easy integration of external systems: Web forms are stored in XML 
format, which gives the advantage of platform and language-independent 
technology, thus making the content available to any web technology (PHP, 
Python, J2EE, AJAX, Flash, Cold Fusion, and so on).
• 
Asset reusability: Static and dynamic include of the content makes the 
structure simpler.
• 
It provides a rapid learning curve. Developing and maintaining Alfresco  
web forms require basic skills in XML, XSD, XSLT, and FreeMarker.

The following diagram shows  how to access content from the Alfresco repository to 
an external application:
Introduction to web forms
Web forms are also known as WCM forms. Web forms are used to capture content 
from the user and store it as Extensible Markup Language (XML) in Alfresco. The 
XML content is created based on an XML Schema Definition (XSD). Web forms 
can be rendered as user-friendly web-based forms. Web forms can be associated 
with multiple rendition templates to render web content in various formats, such as 
plain text, HTML, JSP, and PDF. Out of the box, it supports three types of rendition 
engines: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), FreeMarker, 
and Extensible Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects (XSL-FO). Web forms are 
stored in the Web Client Extension space within Company Home | Data Dictionary 
| Web Forms. Web forms can be configured to any number of projects. As web 
forms are located in the Alfresco space, they can be accessed by the default CIFS, 
FTP, and WebDAV interfaces.
Creating web forms
Let's take the same example as mentioned previously, of the Cignex website. We will 
create web forms for the blogs and news sections. Also, we will associate these web 
forms with the rendition templates. Finally, we will create content using web forms 
and preview it.

Web Content Production with Web Forms
[ 108 ]
The process to define and create web forms in Alfresco is as follows:
1.	 Identify structure to be used for each web form.
2.	 Define your XSD file.
3.	 Create a web form using XSD.
Identifying the structure to be used for each 
web form
To create a web form you are required to create an XML Schema Definition (XSD) 
file with an extension as .xsd. XSD specifies how to formally describe the elements 
in an XML document. Before creating an XSD file you will need to decide what all 
user interface components you want to display in a web form. To create a schema 
for a web form, you analyze its structure defining each structural element as you 
encounter it. As mentioned previously, we will create web forms for the news and 
blogs sections. Consider that some of the elements that are required in creating an 
XSD file for news are: Brief Title, News Page Headline, News Page Sub Headline, 
News Page Content, News Article Graphic, Image Caption, Image Title, and News 
Date. Now that you have decided the elements, you will learn how to create an XSD 
file for simple user interface controls. You will know more about advanced controls 
in the short while.
Defining a schema
To create an XSD file we have to start with the standard XML declaration followed 
by the xs:schema element that defines a schema:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?> 
<xs:schema xmlns:xs=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
 xmlns:trn="http://www.alfrescobook.com/webforms"
 xmlns:alf=http://www.alfresco.org
targetNamespace="http://www.alfrescobook.com/webforms"
elementFormDefault="qualified"
  > 
</xs:schema>
In the previous schema, we use the standard namespace (xs), and the URI associated 
with this namespace is the schema language definition, which has the standard 
value of http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema. It is important to specify a 
namespace (xlmns:trn) for your web forms to eliminate collisions. You can have 
the same namespace for a specific development project. We will use this element 
while generating renditions. The alf namespace is added to enable label, alert, and 
appearance elements while writing an XSD.

Defining a complex element
Now we can define elements inside a complex element. First we have to define a 
root element. Let's define news as a root element. This element has an attribute and 
it contains other elements, therefore we consider it as a complex type. The child 
elements of the news element are surrounded by an xs:sequence element that 
defines an ordered sequence of sub-elements. The syntax for defining a complex 
element is:
<xs:element name="news"> 
  <xs:complexType> 
    <xs:sequence> 
      ... 
    </xs:sequence> 
  </xs:complexType> 
</xs:element>
Defining a simple element
We can also define a few simple elements inside the complex element. Simple 
elements are those elements that do not contain any attribute. Each element 
is defined with a name and type. Let's define a few simple elements such as 
shortTitle, contentHeader, contentSubHeader, contentText, and so on.
The syntax for defining a simple element is:
<xs:element name="shortTitle" type="xs:normalizedString"/>
Here shortTitle is the name of the element and normalizedString is the data  
type of the element. Following is an example of  simple elements defining inside 
complex elements.
<xs:element name="news"> 
  <xs:complexType> 
    <xs:sequence> 
      <xs:element name="shortTitle" type="xs:normalizedString "/> 
      <xs:element name="contentHeader" type="xs:normalizedString "/> 
      <xs:element name="contentSubHeader" type="xs:string"/> 
      <xs:element name="contentText" type="xs:string"/> 
    </xs:sequence> 
  </xs:complexType> 
</xs:element>
An XML schema has a lot of built-in data types. Each of these data types has a 
default widget rendering within the generated XForm in Alfresco.

The following table shows the associated widgets with the most commonly used 
XSD data types:
XSD Data Type
User Interface Widgets
xs:normalizedString
Textbox
xs:string, xs:anyType
WYSIWYG editor, Text area
xs:date
Calendar control
xs:time
Time picker
xs:anyURI
Asset picker
xs:boolean
Checkbox
xs:integer, xs:float, xs:double, xs:decimal
Slider control
xs:enumeration
Radio button, Drop down
Now we will learn a few attributes that can be applied to an element in order to 
make it mandatory, optional, default value, or fixed value.
Default and fixed values for elements
An attribute may have a default or fixed value. A default value is automatically 
assigned to the element and you can specify any other value. A fixed value is also 
automatically assigned to the element, but you cannot specify another value. This 
can be considered as a read-only value. Following is the code snippet for defining 
default value.
<xs:element name="contentHeader" type="xs:normalizedString"  
default="News Full Headline">
Optional and required values for elements
We can define the number of possible occurrences for an element with the maxOccurs 
and minOccurs attributes. maxOccurs specifies the maximum number of occurrences 
for an element and minOccurs specifies the minimum number. The default value for 
both maxOccurs and minOccurs is 1, which means the field is mandatory.
To set the element as optional, you have to set the value of minOccurs to 0 as follows:
<xs:element name="contentSubHeader" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0"  
  maxOccurs="1">
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 4
[ 111 ]
The element can appear multiple times by setting the maxOccurs attribute of the 
element to "unbounded", which means that there can be as many occurrences of the 
element as the content contributor wishes. We can also fix the occurrences of the 
element by specifying any number.
Advanced schema attributes
There are some advanced schemas attributes provided that will enhance the 
capabilities provided within a form. For instance, you may want to display images  
in the web form. You may also think of validation in the web forms that will validate 
your content. For this, you are required to customize some of the widgets  
in web forms.
File pickers
Alfresco uses the xs:anyURI data type to overcome limitations such as inter-document 
relationships. Although XML standards do exist for defining relationships (XPointer 
and XLink), both are stagnant (no updates since 2001) and neither has achieved 
widespread adoption:
<xs:element name="contentGraphic" type="xs:anyURI" />
This results in an "asset picker" widget, which will allow the content contributor  
to browse and select content from the web project. The following code snippet 
provides the ability to specify an image picker to get the images from any folder  
in the web project:
<xs:element name="contentGraphic" type="xs:anyURI" minOccurs="0"  
  maxOccurs="1"
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
  <alf:label>News Article Graphic</alf:label>
  <alf:appearance>image_file_picker</alf:appearance>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>

On implementation of this code snippet, a Select button (shown in the following 
screenshot) will be displayed for each of the images:
We also have a few other preconfigured appearance options defined in the web-
client-config-wcm.xml file, which is placed under <install-alfresco>/tomcat/
webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/.
Here are some examples of preconfigured appearances from the  
web-client-config-wcm.xml file:
Appearance
Description
folder_restricted_file_picker
Picks files from a specific folder
search_restricted_file_picker
Searches files from a specific folder
image_file_picker
Uploads images
html_file_picker
Uploads HTML files
folder_picker
Uploads folders
file_picker
Uploads any file
If you want to upload HTML files, you have to put html_file_picker inside 
the <alf:appearance> tag. For files and folders you can have file_picker and 
folder_picker respectively.

Suppose you want to provide restrictions to file pickers and be relative to the  
root of the web project folder. Thus, the contents of the specified folder will be 
available for selecting in the file picker. This can be achieved by uncommenting  
the section in the code below (which is highlighted in bold) in the same  
web-client-config-wcm.xml file:
<widget xforms-type="xf:upload" 
  appearance="folder_restricted_file_picker"
  javascript-class-name="alfresco.xforms.FilePicker">
<param name="selectable_types">wcm:avmcontent,wcm:avmfolder</param>
<param name="folder_restriction">/common/pages</param>
</widget>
Define this widget in the XSD file, as follows:
<xs:element name="contentGraphic" type="xs:anyURI" minOccurs="0"  
  maxOccurs="1"
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
  <alf:label>News Article Graphic</alf:label>
  <alf:appearance>folder_restricted_file_picker</alf:appearance>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
This customized file picker will search for only folders inside common/pages folder 
as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Web Content Production with Web Forms
[ 114 ]
Another important feature, which will make search faster and time saving, is the 
reusability of search. You don't have to browse every time for the files.
The config_search_name parameter must be set to the name of a configured search. 
The file picker contents will be restricted to the results of this named configured 
search. The configured search must be stored in the Public Saved Searches folder.
The search is Lucene based and it will only query content of the Staging Sandbox. 
The public saved search is actually stored as an XML document in the Alfresco 
repository. Therefore, we can modify it with any Lucene query that is supported by 
Alfresco WCM search. The following code snippet will search for "training" as a text 
in all of the files of the web project submitted to the staging server:
<widget xforms-type="xf:upload" 
  appearance="search_restricted_file_picker"
  javascript-class-name="alfresco.xforms.FilePicker">
<param name="config_search_name">training</param>
</widget>
Define this widget in the XSD file, as follows:
<xs:element name="contentGraphic" type="xs:anyURI" minOccurs="0"  
  maxOccurs="1"
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
  <alf:label>News Article Graphic</alf:label>
  <alf:appearance>search_restricted_file_picker</alf:appearance>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
The following screenshot shows how to save 'config_search_name' text in a public 
search folder so that this can used while searching in the web project:

The file picker will search all files having the word "training" within its name. The 
following screenshot shows the search result:
You can also customize file pickers. You have to define all customizations in  
web-client-config-wcm.xml. Using the following code snippet you will have  
the option of selecting only JPEG files from the web project. The selectable_types 
parameter must be set to restrict which types of content are selectable in the widget.
www.it-ebooks.info

Web Content Production with Web Forms
[ 116 ]
The filter_mimetypes parameter can be used to filter selectable files by  
MIME types:
<widget xforms-type="xf:upload" 
  appearance="custom_image_file_picker"
  javascript-class-name="alfresco.xforms.FilePicker">
<param name="selectable_types">wcm:avmcontent</param>
<param name="filter_mimetypes">image/jpeg</param>
</widget>
Define this widget in the XSD file, as follows:
<xs:element name="image" type="xs:anyURI" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
  <alf:appearance>custom_image_file_picker</alf:appearance>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
Since we have customized file picker, in the following screenshot you will find only 
JPEG files:
 
With the previous code snippet, we have customized image_file_picker. In this 
manner, you can customize other file pickers also.
Please note all of the customization related to file pickers has to be 
provided in the specified file—<install-alfresco>/tomcat/
webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF /classes/alfresco/web-
client-config-wcm.xml.

Tool tips and labels
You can also provide a label for an element specified in your XSD file. By default, 
the label created by the form processor for each element is simply the element's 
name. You could also get a tool tip for the label you have provided. Hence, the label 
becomes News Page Sub-Headline instead of contentSubHeader. Whenever you 
drag a mouse over the label you will get help for the label:
<xs:element name="contentSubHeader" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" 
maxOccurs="1">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
<alf:label>News Page Sub-Headline</alf:label>
<alf:hint>Please enter the news page sub-headline if the news has a 
sub-headline.</alf:hint>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
Localization
You can also localize the label or alert by specifying a message bundle key in  
the annotation:
<xs:element name="emailId" type="xs:string">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
<alf:label>${email}</alf:label>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
This can be achieved by creating the following message bundle file. Create a 
property file with name strings.properties in the Company Home | Data 
Dictionary | Web Forms | <form space name>| strings.properties with the 
following code:
email = Please enter a proper Email Id .
www.it-ebooks.info

[ 118 ]
The property files can also be internationalized by having different versions for 
language or locale combination. The default configured property file locations from 
highest to lowest precedence are:
1.	 Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms | <form space name> | 
strings.properties.
2.	 Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms | strings.properties.
3.	 webclient.properties placed in <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/
alfresco/WEB-INF /classes/alfresco/messages/.
Validation
You can provide validations to any of the fields. For instance, if you provide the 
correct order ID, the element will be highlighted in red. This indicates that the value 
of the element must be a string, it must be exactly six characters in a row, and those 
characters must be a number from 0 to 9:
<xs:element name="orderId">
<xs:simpleType>
<xs:restriction base="xs:string"> 
    <xs:pattern value="[0-9]{6}"/> 
</xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>
</xs:element>
Customizing the WYSIWYG editor
You can customize the WYSIWYG editor easily. The WYSIWYG editor is the 
TinyMCE editor. When we define a simple element of type string, we can see Rich 
Text Editor with limited functionalities. We can also have many other features 
available with Rich Text Editor. See the following code for the advanced editor. With 
this we can have features such as alignment, font family, and font size:
<xs:element name="contentSubHeader" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" 
maxOccurs="1">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
<alf:label>News Page Sub-Headline</alf:label>
<alf:hint>Please enter the news article sub-headline if the article 
has a sub-headline.</alf:hint>
<alf:appearance>full</alf:appearance>

</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>

[ 119 ]
If you want more advanced features for the editor, such as table, you can use the 
following code in the XSD file:
<xs:element name="contentSubHeader" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" 
maxOccurs="1">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
<alf:label>News Page Sub-Headline</alf:label>
<alf:hint>Please enter the news article sub-headline if the 
article has a sub-headline.</alf:hint>
   <alf:appearance>custom</alf:appearance>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
Suppose you want to customize these editors. You want to hide bold, italic feature 
and reduce the height of the editor. The customization code has to be placed in the 
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF /classes/alfresco/

We can also easily install additional plugins by putting 
them in the <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/
alfresco/scripts/tiny_mce/plugins folder.
Dynamically populating lists (in drop-down lists) or conditional 
drop downs
A drop-down list can be handled with the xs:enumeration element within the 
xs:restriction element that defines the type of enumeration. For example, all the 
values in the list should be string, as follows:
<xs:element name="disclaimer" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:appinfo>
<alf:label>Disclaimer</alf:label>
<alf:appearance>minimal</alf:appearance>
</xs:appinfo>
</xs:annotation>
<xs:simpleType>
<xs:restriction base="xs:string">
<xs:enumeration value="news" />
<xs:enumeration value="blogs" />
</xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>
</xs:element>
Reuse of common XSD and JSP
Use of includes will enable you to reuse the common structure across multiple  
files. You can also call a web script in include schemaLocation. Please note:  
for this, the virtual server should be running. We will see example of includes  
in the later sections.
<xs:include schemaLocation="/common/inc/contentType.xsd" />
<xs:include schemaLocation="/common/inc/contentType.jsp "/>	
<xs:include schemaLocation="webscript://path/to/my/
webscript?storeid={storeid}" />

For more information about XSD, refer to the 
website http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema.
In order to create the XSD file, follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to <installed-alfresco>/extras. Create folder wcm/forms.
2.	 Create a file named news.xsd in the above-specified path and populate it 
with the downloaded code from Packt's website.
3.	 Create a file named blogs.xsd in the above-specified path and populate it 
with the downloaded code from Packt's website.
4.	 Create a file named training.xsd in the above-specified path and populate 
it with the downloaded code from Packt's website.
Download the complete code samples from 
the Packt website.
The XSD file is now ready to use. The next task is to create web forms. For this you 
first have to create a web project. This section uses the web project that you have 
already created as a part of your Cignex sample application in Chapter 3. As a part of 
the sample application, you will manage content in the Cignex web project. For more 
information about the web project and sample application, refer to Chapter 3.
Create a web form in Alfresco
You can create a web form using two ways:
• 
Directly from Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms space 
(Create Web Form). Using this first option we can only create web forms; it is 
not associated to any project.
• 
Using Edit Web Project setting wizard in a web project (assuming you have 
already created a web project). It gives the flexibility to associate a web form 
with the web project.

The process to create web forms is as follows:
1.	 Ensure that the Alfresco Server is up and running.
2.	 Go to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms.
3.	 Clicking on the Create Web Form link opens the Create Web Form Wizard 
window. This is the Create Web Form pane, as you can see from the list of 
steps at the left of the pane. You may also notice that the wizard window has 
four steps, as shown in the following screenshot. The first step is to upload 
the XSD file, the second step is to configure template for rendition output, the 
third step is to define the workflow for form data, and the fourth step is to 
confirm the web form.
4.	 In the Step One window, you will notice a Browse button to upload the 
XSD file. Click on Browse to locate and upload the news.xsd file created in 
the folder <installed-alfresco>/extras/wcm/forms. After uploading, 
it will automatically fill up the values like Root element, Name, Title, and 
Output path pattern. You can change the output path pattern. This means 
the XML file will be created in the specified path. Take a look at the following 
screenshot and change the Output path pattern and Description as specified. 
Then click on Next.

5.	 In the Step Two window, the Configure Template page is shown. This step 
is optional. Leave all values blank and click on Next. (This step allows you to 
generate forms in various outputs. We will examine this in the next section of 
this chapter.)
6.	 In the Step Three window, the Configure Workflow page is shown. Select 
the No not now option as shown in the following screenshot (this step allows 
the creation of default workflows for form data. You will know more about 
this in the next chapter):

7.	 Clicking on the Next button will take you to the Step Four window, which 
displays a summary of the web form. Click on the Finish button and this  
will create a web form. You will notice a new space called news inside 
Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms. Inside this space you  
will see the news.xsd file.
8.	 Continue the previous steps to upload the blogs.xsd and training.xsd files.
Please provide the Output path pattern as common/inc/${name}.xml 
for creating blogs and training web forms when the Web Form Details 
window is opened.
Do not proceed to the subsequent sections without first creating the web 
forms. The remaining sample solution is based on these web forms. Please 
specify the Output path pattern as shown in a previous screenshot for 
news, training, and the blogs web form.

Rendition templates
Rendition templates simplifies and accelerates the web publishing process by 
transforming the web form-managed XML content into web content. Rendition 
templates can be written in the FreeMarker template language (with an extension 
.ftl), Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (with an extension .xslt),  
and Extensible Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects (with an extension .xsl-fo). 
You can leverage the built-in renditioning engine for FreeMarker, XSL, and  
XSL-FO template languages. After a content item (XML file) is created with a web 
form, each rendition template is configured for that content type to produce an output 
in a desirable format. It mainly includes plain text, JSP, PDF, and HTML.
The second step of the Create Web Form wizard suggests configuring a template 
for rendition output. In this section, you will learn in detail about how to create and 
configure a template while creating web forms. We will use the FreeMarker template 
for rendition in this chapter and will see an overview about XSLT and XSL-FO.
Using FreeMarker templates for renditions
FreeMarker is an open source template engine. It is a generic tool for generating text 
output (which can be anything from HTML to auto-generated source code) based 
on templates. FreeMarker is designed to be practical for the generation of HTML 
web pages, by following the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. The idea behind 
using the MVC pattern for dynamic web pages is that you separate the content 
authors from the programmers. This separation is useful, even for projects where the 
programmer and the HMTL page author are the same person, as it helps to keep the 
application clear and easier to maintain. If you want that page to be more dynamic, 
then you begin to put special parts into the HTML, which will be understood by 
FreeMarker. For instance, "${...}" will produce output with the actual value of 
the thing inside the curly brackets. Presentation templates are written in FreeMarker 
template language and will have a .ftl extension.

In the following figure, the content authors create document content in Alfresco. The 
programmers create the presentation template file with stylesheets and HTML code, 
taking care of look and feel requirements. The final content will be generated by the 
FreeMarker engine (which is embedded in Alfresco) by applying the presentation 
template on the document content as shown in the following figure:
FreeMarker template engine within Alfresco
The FreeMarker template engine is embedded within Alfresco. FreeMarker takes 
schema as input and generates text (HTML or XML) as output. FreeMarker also 
supports XSLT to translate XML content.

Alfresco objects available to FreeMarker
The default model provides a set of named objects that wrap Alfresco Node objects 
to provide a rich, object-oriented layer, suitable for scripting usage. If you are 
accessing the templates through the web-client UI, then the following named objects 
are provided by default:
Named object
Description
avm_sandbox_url
This provides the URL to the root of the  
current sandbox.
form_instance_data_file_name
This provides the name of the file containing the 
form instance data being used.
rendition_file_name
This provides the filename of the rendition being 
produced.
parent_path
This provides the parent_path of the rendition 
being produced.
For example, consider the following FreeMarker template. In FreeMarker, all 
variables and functions are in a hash called alf:
<html>
<head>
<title>Whats New</title>
</head>
<body>
        <h1>${alf.parent_path}</h1>
</body>
</html>
At runtime, the value of variable alf.parent_path will be the path of XML file, 
which is generated while creating content.
The Alfresco Wiki website (http://wiki.alfresco.com) 
contains a complete reference to the FreeMarker template engine.

FreeMarker template-node model API
These objects, and any child node objects, are called template-node objects, and they 
provide the following API:
Node method
Description
parseXMLDocument(String 
virtualPath)
A map of the properties of the node.
For example, userhome, properties, and name.
Properties may return several different types of objects; 
this depends entirely on the underlying property type 
in the repository. If the property is multi-valued, then 
the result will be a sequence, which can be indexed like 
any other sequence or array.
parseXMLDocuments(String 
formName, String 
virtualPath)
A sequence (list) of the child nodes. For example, a list 
of documents in a space.
FreeMarker directives
Like any programming language, the FreeMarker templating language also supports 
fundamental directives such as the following:
${ }
#if, #else, #elseif
#switch, #case
#list
#assign
#function
#include
<#-- comment -->
<!--comment -->
Defining and creating FreeMarker templates
Continuing with our example of the Cignex.com website, we have already created 
web forms for blogs and a news section. Now we will associate these web forms  
with the rendition templates. We will first learn to create FreeMarker templates.  
Let's learn how to create .ftl files.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4
[ 131 ]
To create .ftl files, we have to start with the standard declaration of the default 
name space for the associated web form (consider the blog web form) using the 
<#ftl  > tag (check the target namespace of the blogs.xsd file that has been used 
in creating the blog web form), as follows:
<#ftl ns_prefixes={"D", "http://www.alfrescobook.com/webforms"}>
Now we need to display the elements we have used for the blog web form. In the 
blogs.xsd file, we have defined the root element as "blogs". Assume we want to use 
the mainTitle, contentSubHeader, and publishedDate elements of the blog.xsd 
in the .ftl file. The following table shows various uses of FreeMarker directives:
Description
XSD syntax
FTL syntax
Display single 
element
<xs:element   
name="mainTitle"  
type="xs:normalizedString"
</xs:element>
${blogs.mainTitle }
Display 
recurring 
elements
<xs:element 
name="subHeader" 
minOccurs="1" 
maxOccurs="unbounded">
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element 
name="headerLine" 
type="xs:normalizedString" 
/></xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
<#list blogs. subHeader as 
contentSubHeader >
  ${ contentSubHeader.  
  headerLine }
</#list>
Sort the 
recurring 
elements
<xs:element name=" 
subHeader " 
type="xs:string" 
minOccurs="1" 
maxOccurs="unbounded">
<#list blogs. subHeader?sort_
by("headerLine ")?reverse as  
contentSubHeader >
${ contentSubHeader. 
headerLine }</#list>
Conditional 
checks
<xs:element 
name="publishedDate"

   != "" > 
  ${blog.publishedDate}

Extensible Stylesheet Language
The Extensible Stylesheet Language is divided into two sub-languages: Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) and Extensible Stylesheet  
Language-Formatting Objects (XSL-FO).
Using XSLT for renditions
XSLT is a stylesheet language for XML documents. It is designed to transform 
XML documents into other formats such as XHTML (Extensible HTML). With 
XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file. You 
can also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests, and make decisions about 
which elements to hide and display. XSLT uses XPath to find information in an 
XML document. XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in 
XML documents. XSLT uses XPath to define parts of the source document that 
should match one or more predefined templates. When a match is found, XSLT will 
transform the matching part of the source document into the result document. XSLT 
is written in stylesheet language and will have .xsl extension.

Some of the fundamentals used for XSLT are:
Declare namespaces
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
xmlns:newsevents="http://www.cignex.com/newsevents"
xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/02/xpath-functions"
exclude-result-prefixes="xhtml">
Define output 
format
<xsl:output method="html"  encoding="UTF-8" 
indent="yes"
  doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0  
    Transitional//EN" 
  doctype -system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/ 
    xhtml1-transitional.dtd" 
  media-type="text/html"/>
Define Template
<xsl:template match="/">
Iterate from a set of 
repeating elements
<xsl:for-each select="/newsevents:news_events">( 
newsevents is prefix and news_events is complex 
element defined)
Select the values 
of single occurring 
element
<xsl:value-of select="newsevents:title"/>
Provide conditions
<xsl:if test="/newsevents:news_events/ 
  newsevents:training-date">
<xsl:value-of select=" newsevents:news_events/ 
  newsevents:training-date"/>
</xsl:if>
Let's develop an XSL template for rendition:
1.	 Navigate to the <installed-alfresco>/extras/wcm/forms folder.
2.	 Create a file named training.xsl in the above-specified path and populate 
it with the downloaded code from the Packt website.
Download the complete code samples from Packt Publishing's 
website. For your reference, a complete guide to XSL template is 
available at: http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/.

Using XSL-FO for renditions
It is designed to provide a mechanism for formatting XML data for print, screen, and 
other output media. Transforming XML for print is accomplished by transforming an 
XML document to a Formatting Objects (FO) document, which itself is XML based, 
via XSLT. The Formatting Objects processor is able to read the FO document and 
transform it for different types of print output. The most common and best-supported 
print output is currently Adobe PDF. XSL-FO has the advantage of being able to 
produce PDFs.
The template files are now ready to use. The next task is to associate rendition 
templates with the web forms created earlier, for this web form should be created in 
Alfresco. In our case, we have already created a web form in the earlier section.
Associating rendition templates to web forms in 
Alfresco
Templates cannot be associated through the web project after the web form is 
created. Since the web form is already created, the association of template must  
be done through Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms | <web-form 
space name>. We will configure our template to the blog's web form. The process is 
as follows:
1.	 Ensure that the Alfresco Server is up and running.
2.	 Go to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms | <web-form space 
name> | Blog:

3.	 Clicking on Edit Web Form action image under the web form space name 
(as shown in the previous screenshot) opens the Edit Web Form Wizard 
window. You may notice that the Edit Web Form Wizard window has four 
steps, as shown in the following screenshot. The first step is to delete the 
previously uploaded XSD (if you want to upload another XSD) file and 
then upload the XSD, the second step is to configure templates for rendition 
output, the third step is to define the workflow for form data, and the fourth 
step is to confirm the web form.
4.	 In the Step One window, you will notice the information provided about the 
web project if this corresponding web form is associated. You will also see 
that the rest of the values are prepopulated on the basis of the attached web 
form. You are given the facility to upload or delete the existing XSD file, if 
required. You can also change the Output path pattern. For now we will not 
make any change, so click on Next.

5.	 In the Step Two window, the Configure Templates page is shown. This step 
allows you to upload a template file in order to generate forms in various 
outputs. Click on Browse to locate and upload the blog.ftl file created in 
the <installed-alfresco>/extras/wcm/forms folder. After uploading, 
it will automatically fill up values, such as Rendering Engine, Name, Title, 
Rendition mimetype, and Output path pattern. By default, the Rendition 
mimetype will be selected as HTML. You can change the output path pattern 
and also the extension. This means the file will be created with the specified 
extension in the specified path. Take a look at the following screenshot and 
change the output path as specified. We have also changed the extension in 
order to generate the JSP file. By default, an HTML file will be generated. 
Click on the Add to List button to add the uploaded templates. You can click 
on the Add to List button as many times as you want to upload templates. A 
list of associated templates will be visible at the bottom. The Remove icon is 
also provided to delete the template in case it's not required. Click on Next:

Do not proceed to the subsequent sections without first configuring the 
templates. The remaining sample solution is based on these web forms 
and templates. Remember to specify the output path pattern as shown in 
the previous screenshots for news and blogs. The Alfresco Wiki website 
(http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/WCM_Forms_Rendering) 
contains information about forms and widgets.
Associating web forms and renditions for 
specific/multiple project(s)
Now we have created templates for our web forms. We have also associated our 
template with the web forms and we are ready to use these forms to create and 
publish content. We will subscribe to both (news and blog) web forms in this web 
project and configure each for our web project website's unique content generation. 
Once configured for a given web project, a Content Contributor can create new web 
content using web forms via the Create Content wizard.
Follow these steps to configure web forms and templates to the web project:
1.	 Go to Company Home | Web Projects | Cignex.
2.	 Select Edit Web Project Settings from the action menu.
3.	 Click on Next.
4.	 On the next screen, again click on Next.

you have to click on the Add to List button.
6.	 If you want to create a new web form, you can select the Create Web Form 
button, which will open the Create Web Form wizard. Once the web form 
is created you can click on the Add to List button to add the newly-created 
web form. You can see the added web forms in the panel as shown in the 
following screenshot. You will also see the space of the newly created web 
form inside Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms.
7.	 You can also set up the templates if more than one template is associated 
with each web form selected. You can also select the web form details to 
change the Output path pattern, Title, Description, and also configure 
workflow. You will learn in detail about configuring workflows in the next

A few points to be considered are as follows:
• 
As we have learned, we can create a web form using two ways. 
• 
Once a web form is created, association of the rendering template is available 
only with the first option (Create Web Form).
• 
Output paths for web forms and templates can be different for each web 
project for the same web form. Using the first option (Create Web Form), you 
can create a generic output path and then this can be customized for various 
projects using the second option (Edit Web Project setting).
Creating dynamic content
To support creation and editing of web content, Alfresco provides support for a 
sandbox development model as you have read in Chapter 3, Getting Started with 
Alfresco WCM.
There are multiple methods of adding and creating content for a web project. In 
addition to creating web content within a project, you can also upload individual 
files from your computer and perform a bulk import. For more details refer to 
Chapter 3, Getting Started with Alfresco WCM. Let's assume that we have all the folders 
in place inside the Cignex web project. We just want to create content for the news 
and Blog web forms. The link for the news, blog, and training web form is specified 
inside index.jsp, which is placed under the root folder of the project. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Go to Company Home | Web Projects | Cignex.
2.	 Expand the web form panel in the user sandbox. You will see a list of web 
forms, which are configured for the web project. Select Create Content next 
to the web form:

Associating a .xml file to the web form
Suppose you want to do data migration of content from other systems to Alfresco 
WCM. There is a manageable way by which you can easily move content as XML 
in WCM and link it to a web form. You can do this through the API or web client 
extension. Follow these steps to perform the procedure using the web client extension.
1.	 Upload an .xml file to the web project. This XML file should have the 
structure similar to the web forms. Go to the Cignex web project. In  
My Sandbox, click on the Browse Website link to browse to the folders 
created in the web project.
2.	 Go to the common | inc folder. Click on Add Content to upload an .xml file 
of the same structure as the news or blog.xsd.

Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how Alfresco WCM makes it simpler to manage 
content through a user-friendly and technology-neutral (as much as possible) interface:
• 
Alfresco web forms enable users to create XML content from a simple 
browser-based form.
• 
There are three types of renditions available: FTL, XSLT, and XSL-FO. With 
renditions, you can manage the content in various formats.
• 
A dynamic website can be developed easily with the web forms.
• 
Web forms can associate with specific/multiple projects.
• 
Web content can be searched using a query.
• 
Dashlets are provided to access easily and speed through the  
publishing process.
In the next chapter, we are going to learn about WCM Workflows. Workflows can be 
configured for any web form. Through workflow, web content can be submitted to 
the Staging Sandbox. From the Staging Sandbox it can deployed to servers.

WCM Workflows
Workflow is an automation of a business process, during which documents are 
passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural 
rules. Every content management system implementation will have workflow 
requirements. Workflow provides ownership and control on the content and 
processes. Alfresco web project uses workflows to support any set of changes, 
either automated or user-driven steps, in a business process before final commit to 
the Staging Sandbox. WCM Workflows can be configured for each form or for any 
arbitrary set of non-form assets. In this chapter, you will understand the basic out-of-
the-box workflow capabilities of the Alfresco WCM and the ways to extend it as per 
your business requirements.

WCM Workflows
[ 160 ]
Why workflows are required
Consider that we want to develop any website; so our first step will be to create web 
content, and the next step will be to get the approval of the reviewers in order to 
publish content onto live servers. We would also like to set up a test server so that 
one can preview the changes and finally the content can be pushed to the staging 
servers and then live servers. At each stage it seems we require a set of processes 
to be followed to get our approval completed and go to the next stage. This can be 
achieved using WCM Workflows.
WCM Workflows are required to follow the user approval process for submitted 
content, to publish them on the Staging Sandbox. You must deal with the approval 
of content items that are routed through workflow and the submission of the items to 
staging servers and then the live server. Submitted changes are routed via workflow 
(assume workflow is configured for the web project) for one or multiple users to 
review and approve, either serially or in parallel, using Alfresco's out-of-the-box 
workflow (or any custom-built WCM Workflow). On approval of the item, content is 
submitted to the Staging Sandbox. Even if we don't configure workflow for any item, 
the submission takes place in the background using workflow and each content item 
remains in the Modified Items list until its submission is complete. To verify this you 
can see a workflow task in the My Task To Do dashlet of the content reviewer for 
a fraction of a second. Refresh the page as necessary, to see if the workflow task has 
been removed from the My Task To Do dashlet and that the Modified Items list of 
the user's sandbox is empty.
The additional advantage you get from workflow is that you can configure the 
launch date and expiration date when promoting content to staging. Prior to 
this launch date, users can preview the changes and cancel the pending launch 
if required. In the Staging box, it will be reflected in Content Awaiting Launch. 
Upon expiration, users can see that item as a task in their My Tasks To Do dashlet 
to decide whether the content should be updated or removed from the site. This 
content expiration also works in conjunction with Alfresco's new Links Validation 
service, ensuring that the site's link integrity is incrementally tested against the new 
pending update. In this manner, content cannot only be regularly refreshed through 
an automated, task-driven review process, but can also be tested upon change so that 
no errors are accidentally introduced in the form of broken links.
Another advantage is that once the content is approved, a snapshot is taken to 
the Staging box. For each submission a snapshot is maintained, which gives the 
advantage to roll back to any submission at any point of time.

Chapter 5
[ 161 ]
In the previous chapter you learned how to create content. At this point, your web 
project is populated with content items, some imported and some created. Now 
you want to submit the content to the Staging box. You must configure a workflow 
process to get the approval, so the content is now routed through workflow to 
content reviewers for approval. Once you have approved all of your content, 
modified items are deployed to the staging server.
Introduction to the workflow
The WCM Workflow uses the JBoss Business Process Management (jBPM) engine 
in its core. jBPM is an open source, standalone workflow engine. It can run in any 
servlet container—it doesn't require the JBoss Application Server. The jBPM engine is 
responsible for managing deployed processes, instantiating and executing processes, 
persisting process state and metadata to a relational database (via Hibernate), and 
tracking task assignment and task lists. JBoss jBPM is a flexible, extensible workflow 
management system with an intuitive process language to express business 
processes graphically in terms of tasks, wait states for asynchronous communication, 
timers, and automated actions. With jBPM, the Alfresco platform is extended to 
support complex, task-oriented processes. jBPM is built on the idea that any process 
can be described as a graph or a set of connected nodes. jBPM maintains a list of 
tasks assigned to each participant. How users interact with the task list is up to each 
application. In Alfresco, a dashlet displays a to-do list for the currently logged in 
user. As users complete their tasks the tasks are removed from the to-do list.

WCM Workflows
[ 162 ]
Workflows are described with "process definitions" using an XML-based language 
called jBPM Process Definition Language (jPDL). jPDL is one example of a graph-
based execution language.
jPDL is one process language that is build on top of that common framework. It is 
an intuitive process language to express business processes graphically in terms of 
tasks, wait states for asynchronous communication, timers, and automated actions. 
To bind these operations together, jPDL has the most powerful and extensible control 
flow mechanism. jPDL has minimal dependencies and can be used as easily as using 
a Java library.
jPDL includes a graphical designer tool. The designer is a graphical tool for 
authoring business processes. It's an eclipse plugin. Workflows can be performed 
either by handcoding XML or by using the JBoss jBPM Process Designer tool. In the 
later sections, we will see both the approaches.
Workflow process
Whenever content is created or modified for a web project, it is added under 
Modified Items of a user's sandbox. A list of modified items in a user's sandbox 
can be promoted from a sandbox to a Staging Sandbox. Content is promoted from a 
user's sandbox to the Staging Sandbox by initiating the Submit Wizard. This wizard 
is initiated by clicking on either the Submit Selected or Submit All actions in the 
Alfresco web client. Submitted changes are routed via workflow for one or multiple 
users to review and approve, either serially or in parallel using Alfresco's out-of-the-
box Web Site Submission workflow (or any custom-built WCM Workflow). Once 
approved, a snapshot is automatically taken of the Staging box.
The workflow process can be divided into three steps.
1.	 The first step is to define and deploy a workflow in WCM.
2.	 The second step is to associate the workflow to a web form or web project.
3.	 The third step is to submit modified content to the staging server  
using a workflow.

Chapter 5
[ 163 ]
Out-of-the-box workflow
Alfresco provides an inbuilt Web Site Submission workflow to be associated with 
the web project.
Workflow can be configured for both form-based and non-form-based assets.
There are two out-of-the-box flows available for the Web Site Submission workflow:
• 
Serial
1.	 Reviewers approve one at a time and in order.
2.	 If any reviewer rejects, the workflow is sent back to author.
3.	 Upon resubmit, all reviewers are reassigned a task, one at a time.
• 
Parallel
1.	 Reviewers review in parallel to one another.
2.	 If any reviewer rejects, the workflow is sent back to the initiator once all 
the reviewers either approve or reject the workflow.
3.	 Upon resubmit, all reviewers are reassigned a task in parallel.
When the workflow is complete, it promotes the change set to the Staging Sandbox.
Consider a case where a user has to conduct training. In order to arrange the 
training, the concerned user needs to take approval from alternative authorities so 
that the event can be published on the site and participants can register themselves 
for the training. If any of the authorities rejects the training for whatever reason, it 
goes to the trainer who was seeking approval. Now the trainer can either resubmit 
to reviewers or cancel it. If all the authorities approve the training, the event can be 
published on the site.
For this create Mark Steven, Keenan Hall, and Crawford Caton as users. Invite Mark 
Steven as Content Manger on the Cignex web project and Keenan Hall and Crawford 
Caton as Content Reviewers on the Cignex web project. For more information about 
creating users and inviting users refer to Chapter 3, Getting Started with Alfresco WCM.
Configuring workflows
Workflows can be configured for both web forms and non-generated web content. 
In order to submit content to the Staging Sandbox, workflows need to be configured. 
We will discuss shortly how form-based and file-based workflow can be configured, 
and also how content can be submitted to the Staging box.

Associating workflows to web forms
Workflow for web forms can be configured using the Create Web Form Wizard or 
the Edit Web Form wizard. Using these approaches, workflows can be configured 
for all web projects and for a specific web project. As we have already created a web 
form in the last chapter, we will use the same web form to drive a workflow. In this 
example, we have to use the Edit Web Form Wizard. Follow these steps to assign a 
workflow for the web form:
1.	 Ensure that the Alfresco server is up and running.
2.	 Go to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms.
3.	 Click on the Edit Web Form action under the training (web form name) space.
4.	 Clicking on this will open Edit Web Form Wizard. Click on Next twice to 
reach the Configure Workflow window.
5.	 Select the Yes radio button and click on Next.

Associating workflows to web projects
To assign a workflow for a specific project, you can use two approaches. The first 
approach is by using the Create Web Project Wizard that will be used if you are 
creating a new web project. The second approach is by using the Edit Web Project  
Wizard. We will be using the second approach since we have already created the 
Cignex web project. Follow these steps to associate workflow for a web form:
1.	 Ensure that the Alfresco server is up and running.
2.	 Go to Company Home | Web Projects | Cignex.
3.	 Select Edit Web Project Settings from the action menu.

7.	 On clicking the Configure Workflow button, the Configure Workflow 
window is opened. This window is used to configure form-based workflows 
(web form generated content). This is specific for web forms only. Fill out the 
details as shown in the following screenshot:
8.	 Click on OK. Now, if you notice, the attention icon disappears.
9.	 Click on Next. You will again see the Configure Workflow window. Click 
on the Add to List button to add the workflow for the web project. Once the 
workflow is added in the panel, you can configure file-based workflows  
(non-web form generated content). They are configured based on filename 
pattern matching. In Workflow Settings, note the default regex pattern 
matches .*. This default means that any asset web form generated, and 
non-web form generated, will go through this review process. Also, you can 
add the Web Site Submission workflow multiple times in this wizard. For 
each instance you can configure a different chain of reviewers for different 
sections of the websites or types of assets by modifying the regex pattern 
match in Workflow Settings, for example, .css, .html.

Please note that the Configure Workflow window can be 
used for both file and non-web form generated assets. But this 
window is mainly used for non-web form generated assets.
10.	 Click on Finish.
Submitting content to the Staging box
Content can be submitted in two ways.
• 
The first option is by using the Edit Web Content Wizard or the Create Web 
Content Wizard. With this option you can submit only form-based content.
• 
The second option is by using the Submit Selected or Submit All option 
provided under Modified Items. With this option you can submit both  
form-based assets and non-form based assets.
Using the Edit Web Content wizard
We assume that the web content is already created as it was done in the previous 
chapter. So we are going to use the Edit Web Content wizard. Log in as Mark 
Steven, who is the Content Manger of the Cignex project. Refer to Chapter 3, Getting 
Started with Alfresco WCM for how to invite users to a web project and assign roles. 
Follow these steps to directly submit content to the workflow:

submit some of the items. For this, you can select the checkboxes placed next 
to the item to submit the selected item. Second, select the top-most checkbox 
to select all the files for submission.
3.	 The Submit All action can also be used if you want to submit all the items 
listed under Modified Items.
4.	 The Submit option is also provided at the right-hand side of the item to 
submit only that item.

5.	 When the Submit Items wizard is opened, you will notice most of the 
information is filled. If you want you can modify this. You are required to 
put information about the workflow name and the description that will 
display the name and description of the corresponding snapshot in staging. 
Configure the workflow if you want to modify some details. By doing this 
the default file workflow is overridden for this specific workflow instance. 
You can also configure the launch and expiration dates. When a launch 
date is set, approved content changes are maintained in their own separate 
workflow sandbox until the specified time and date. Prior to that date, the 
Content Publisher or Reviewers can preview the future state of the website 
and immediately promote or cancel the pending launch. Specific expiration 
dates can also be set on a global or asset-by-asset basis. Upon expiration, 
users are automatically assigned the asset as a task, so that they can make a 
determination whether the asset should be updated or removed from the site. 
Put the details as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Click on OK to start the workflow process. The content will start submitting 
to the Content Reviewer. Once in a workflow, assets cannot be submitted 
again until the workflow completes. Files in a current workflow will not have 
the Submit, Update, and Revert commands available.

procedure of submitting content from scratch (this means the workflow 
sandbox is deleted, and in the future when you submit the same content, 
it will create new workflow with a new Advanced Versioning Manager 
(AVM) store). If you click on Resubmit For Review, you will find again, task 
for both the users—Keenan Hall and Crawford Caton (this indicates the 
same AVM store will be in use).

19.	 Now log in as Mark. Note the task on the My Task To Do dashlet only for 
a fraction of seconds (5 seconds). Refresh it after some time; the content is 
already submitted to the Staging box.
20.	 In your user sandbox, expand the Modified Items list. Each content item 
remains in the Modified Items list until its submission is complete. Refresh 
the page after some time. In the Staging Sandbox, expand the Recent 
Snapshots list to view the snapshot you have created.
A few things to be considered when an item is attached to a workflow:
• 
Assets attached to a workflow cannot be submitted to another workflow 
while the first one is running.
• 
If you have to rename, delete, or modify any asset items, then those items are 
also going to submit.
• 
XML and generated renditions are always placed in workflow as a unit. If 
you submit any XML item, then all the items related to that XML will also be 
submitted.
• 
Each workflow creates "AVM" (it creates a branch till it is closed). Hence, 
having more and more active instances will degrade the performance. In 
AVM store, it keeps the entire content of user's sandbox. One should not 
keep pending workflows for a long time. Whenever a Content Reviewer 
receives the notification of a successful approval, the task appears in the task 
list. Close the task as soon as possible. After clicking, the AVM store of that 
workflow instance will be removed.
• 
Any change set associated with a workflow is isolated in its own workflow 
sandbox. Workflow sandboxes are visible via CIFS, but difficult to use due to 
autogenerated folder names (GUIDs).

• 
Content Contributors can continue to work in their sandbox without 
breaking the Reviewer's context.
• 
Content Reviewers can see an in-context preview of the change set as if it had 
been applied to the Staging Sandbox.
Dynamically changing workflow for each 
snapshot submission
Whenever you submit content to the Staging Sandbox, once approved, a snapshot 
is automatically taken of the Staging to provide an archive of the current version of 
the site. This snapshot is maintained over time to provide an audit trail and rollback 
point for previous versions of the site. This gives an advantage of recovering any 
content at any point of time. It also keeps record of all deleted, renamed, and moved 
items. Once a snapshot is taken, all committed changes are immediately reflected 
and available to each user in their own sandbox, enabling all users to consistently 
check their changes against the latest and greatest version of the website.

Creating a custom WCM Workflow for a 
group
You can define and deploy your own task-oriented workflows in the Alfresco 
repository. However, you need to follow a particular format to define your workflow 
and a particular process to deploy it in Alfresco. Workflows can be deployed 
manually (which requires a restart of the server) and dynamically (without starting 
the server). For now we will deploy the workflow manually. These customizations 
are typically deployed via the alfresco/extension folder and require the Alfresco 
server to be restarted to take effect. In the later examples, we will deploy using the 
dynamic approach.
As an example, we will configure one workflow. The use case scenario is as follows.
There is a section of Blogs and News on the Cignex website, which needs to be 
updated monthly. The blog has to be published regularly. In order to publish, one 
needs to follow some process that can be defined in a workflow. The blog has to be 
reviewed by three different groups. Each group has different roles. Groups approve 
the blog one at a time and in order. When the blog is submitted, it will go to the 
first group. All the users belonging to that group will receive a notification via a 
task in the My Pooled Tasks dashlet. Any one of the users can take ownership and 
approve or reject the task. If rejected, it will go to the initiator. On approval it will go 
to next group and the process will continue for all three groups. Once the process is 
complete, a notification will be sent to the initiator. Also the blog would be submitted 
to the Staging box.
For this, create Jennifer Bruce, Kristie Dawid, LeRoy Fuess, Michael Alison, and 
Jessica Tucker as users. Create three groups: Technical Reviewer, Editorial, and 
Publisher. Add Jennifer Bruce and Kristie Dawid to Technical Reviewer, add 
LeRoy Fuess to Editorial, and add Michael Alison and Jessica Tucker to Publisher. 
Invite Technical Reviewer, Editorial, and Publisher as Reviewer on the Cignex web 
project. For more information about creating a group and users refer to Chapter 3, 
Getting Started with Alfresco WCM.

Chapter 5
[ 181 ]
Defining the workflow process
For any workflow to be deployed you should have the following files:
1.	 Task Model: The Task Model provides a description for each of the tasks 
in the workflow. Each task description consists of Name, Title, Properties, 
Mandatory Aspects, and Association.
2.	 Process Definition: The Process Definition describes the states (steps) and 
transitions (choices) of a workflow.
3.	 Resource Bundle (optional): A workflow Resource Bundle provides all the 
human-readable messages displayed in the user interface for managing the 
workflow. Messages include task titles, task property names, task choices, 
and so on.
4.	 web-client-config-custom.xml: Web Client configuration specifies the 
presentation of Tasks and properties to the user in the Alfresco Explorer.
5.	 custom-model-context.xml: The custom model Spring Context file instructs 
Spring on how to bootstrap or load the Task Model definition file, Process 
Definition file, and Resource Bundle.
6.	 web-client-config-wcm.xml: Web Client configuration specifies the 
availability of workflow to the web project in the Alfresco Explorer.
Follow these steps to create a custom workflow.

Step 1: Create a Task Model
For each task in the Process Definition (as defined by <task> elements), it is possible 
to associate a task description. The description specifies information that may be 
attached to a task, that is properties (name and data type) associations (name and 
type of associated object), and mandatory aspects. A user may view and edit this 
information in the Task dialog within the Alfresco Explorer.
The Task Model is expressed as a Content Model, as supported by the Data 
Dictionary. To create a Task Model, create a new Content Model file for Process 
Definition with the .xml extension.
• 
Define a Content Model name
• 
Create a Type for each task
• 
Define Properties
• 
Define and add Aspects to a Type
Define a Content Model name
Create a new Content Model for the Process Definition. Define the namespace of the 
model. XML namespaces provide a method for avoiding element name conflicts. If 
you want to use any other model's task, aspect, or association, then you can use it by 
importing their namespace. Reusability of Task Model is possible.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <model name="bookwcmwf:workflowmodel"
    xmlns="http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0">
  <imports>
    <import uri="http://www.alfresco.org/model/wcmworkflow/1.0"
      prefix="wcmwf" />
    <import uri="http://www.alfresco.org/model/bpm/1.0" prefix="bpm">
  </imports>
  <namespaces>
    <namespace uri="http://book.com" prefix="bookwcmwf" />
  </namespaces>
</model>
Create a Type for each task
For each task we have to define a Content Type. The Type can also be extended  
as follows:
  <types>
    <type name="bookwcmwf:submitReviewTask">
      <parent>wcmwf:startTask</parent>
    </type>
  </types>
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 5
[ 183 ]
Define Properties
Within each Type, describe the Properties and Associations (information) required 
for that task. Properties can also be inherited from other task definitions. Using the 
previous example all the properties of wcmwf:startTask will be added to this Type.
  <type name="bookwcmwf:submitReviewTask">
      <parent>wcmwf:startTask</parent>
      <properties>
        <property name="wcmwf:submitReviewType">
          <title>Serial or Parallel Review</title>
          <type>d:text</type>
         </property>
      </properties>
      <associations>
        <association name="wcmwf:webproject">
          <source>
            <mandatory>false</mandatory>
            <many>false</many>
          </source>
          <target>
            <class>wca:webfolder</class>
            <mandatory>true</mandatory>
            <many>false</many>
          </target>
        </association>
      </associations>
  </type>
Define Aspect
You can also introduce custom properties by defining an Aspect. An Aspect can  
be applied to any Content Type. Once applied, the properties are added to that 
Content Type.
You cannot define a dependency on other Aspects. They cannot be extended.
  <type name="bookwcmwf:verifyBrokenLinksTask">
    <parent>wcmwf:workflowTask</parent>
      <mandatory-aspects>
        <aspect>bookwcmwf:reviewInfo</aspect>
        <aspect>bpm:assignee</aspect>
      </mandatory-aspects>
  </type>
     <aspects>
       <aspect name="bookwcmwf:reviewInfo">
www.it-ebooks.info

WCM Workflows
[ 184 ]
       <properties>
         <property name=" bookwcmwf:reviewerCnt">
           <title>Reviewer Count</title>
           <type>d:int</type>
          <mandatory>true</mandatory>
         </property>
       </properties>
      </aspect>
     </aspects>
The following are the advantages of having custom Aspect over custom content:
• 
Flexibility: You will have more flexibility. Having a custom Aspect will give 
you the flexibility to add an additional set of properties to the documents in 
specific spaces.
• 
Efficiency: Since these properties are applied selectively to certain documents 
only in certain spaces, you will use limited storage in a relational database for 
these properties.
The following are the disadvantages of having custom Aspect over custom content:
• 
High Maintenance: If the custom Aspect (additional properties) is added 
to documents based on business rules, you need to define it at every space, 
wherever required.
• 
Dependency: You cannot define the dependency with other Aspects. For 
example, if you need the effectivity aspect to always be associated with 
the custom aspect, you need to make sure you attach both the Aspects to  
the documents.
Now that we are familiar with the code, let's develop a complete model file to deploy 
our case study in action.
For any customization of files you have to develop the files in the extension folder 
of <install-alfresco>. Create a file book-serial-group-workflow-wcmModel.
xml in the specified location <install-alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/
alfresco/extension. Copy the downloaded content into the file.

Step 2: Create the Process Definition
A Process Definition represents a formal specification of a business process and is 
based on a directed graph. The graph is composed of nodes and transitions. Every 
node in the graph is of a specific Type. The Type of the node defines the runtime 
behavior. A Process Definition has exactly one Start-state and End-state.
The following table describes some of the key terms used in a Process Definition:
Key term 
Description
Swimlane
Swimlane is used to define a role for a user.
Transition
Transitions have a source node and a destination node. The source node is 
represented by the property from and the destination node is represented by 
the property to. It is used to connect nodes. A Transition can optionally have 
a name. The name is represented in the UI with a button.
Task
Tasks are associated with a Swimlane. These tasks are defined in the 
Workflow model files. On the basis of these tasks, the Properties are 
displayed.
Actions
Actions are pieces of Java code that are executed upon events in the process 
execution. These actions are performed on the basis of these tasks, as defined 
in the Process Definition.
Events
The jBPM engine will fire Events during the graph execution. Events specify 
moments in the execution of the process. An Event can be task-create, node-
enter, task-end, process-end, and so on. When the jBPM engine fires an event, 
the list of Actions is executed.
Scripts
Script is executed within Action. Some of the variables that can be available in 
Script are node, task, execution context, and so on.
Nodes
Each Node has a specific type. The Node Type determines what will happen 
when an execution arrives in the Node at runtime.
The following table summarizes the Node Types available in jBPM out of the box.
Node types
Description
Task Node
A Task Node represents one or more tasks that have to be performed  
by users.
Start-state
There can be only one Start-state in the Process Definition, which logs the 
start of the workflow.
decision
The distinction between multiple paths. When the decision between 
multiples path has to be taken, a decision node is used.
fork
A fork splits one path of execution into multiple concurrent paths of 
execution.

WCM Workflows
[ 186 ]
Node types
Description
join
Joins multiple paths into single path. A join will end every token that enters 
the join.
node
The node serves the situation where you want to write your own code in a 
node.
End-state
There can be only one End-state in the Process Definition, which logs the 
end of the workflow.
There are two ways of building the Process Definition. One is by hand, that is 
create a jPDL XML document. The second option is by designer, that is use a tool 
to generate the jPDL XML document. To create a Process Definition, create a new 
Process Definition file with the extension .xml.
Define a Process Definition name
The Process Definition name is important.
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <process-definition xmlns="urn:jbpm.org:jpdl-3.1"  
       name="bookwcmwf:bookworkflow">
In the previous code we have used bookwcmwf:bookworkflow where bookwcmwf is 
the namespace of the workflow model file defined earlier, which we are going to use 
in this Process Definition, and bookworkflow can be any name.
Define a Swimlane
Swimlanes are used to declare workflow "roles". Tasks are associated with a 
Swimlane. Here initiator is the user who is starting the workflow. Likewise, we have 
some other roles also defined. For example, bpm_assignee (one user to whom the 
workflow is assigned), bpm_assignees (one or more user), bpm_groupAssignee 
(single group), and bpm_groupAssignees (one or more groups).
  <swimlane name="initiator"/>
  <swimlane name="approver">
    <assignment  
      class="org.alfresco.repo.workflow.jbpm.AlfrescoAssignment">
      <pooledactors>#{bpm_groupAssignee}</pooledactors>
    </assignment>
  </swimlane>
  <swimlane name="assignee">
    <assignment  
      class="org.alfresco.repo.workflow.jbpm.AlfrescoAssignment">
      <actor>#{bpm_assignee}</actor>
    </assignment>
  </swimlane>

Chapter 5
[ 187 ]
Associate a task
We have already defined task in the Content Model files. On the basis of these tasks 
the properties are displayed. Next step is to add these tasks to the workflow process. 
To start with, add a task to the start node. The Start Task is assigned to the initiator 
of the workflow. It's used to collect the information (that is the workflow parameters) 
required for the workflow to proceed.
  <start-state name="start">
     <task name="bookwcmwf:submitReviewTask" swimlane="initiator"/>
        <transition name="" to="initialise"/>
  </start-state> 
                                                                                           
  <swimlane name="assignee">
    <assignment  
      class="org.alfresco.repo.workflow.jbpm.AlfrescoAssignment">
       <actor>#{bpm_assignee}</actor>
    </assignment>
  </swimlane>
     <task-node name="initialise ">
     <task name="bookwcmwf:verifyBrokenLinksTask"  
       swimlane="assignee" />
       <transition name="abort" to="end">
        <action
          class="org.alfresco.repo.workflow.jbpm.AlfrescoJavaScript">
            <script>
               var mail = actions.create("mail");
                mail.parameters.to =  
                  initiator.properties["cm:email"];
                mail.parameters.subject = "Adhoc Task " +
                  bpm_workflowDescription;
                mail.parameters.from =
                  bpm_assignee.properties["cm:email"];
                mail.parameters.text = "It's done";
                mail.execute(bpm_package);
            </script>
        </action>
     </task-node>
    <end-state name="end"/>

During runtime, all the properties of the task bookwcmwf:submitReviewTask are 
visible to the user who is initiating a workflow. Once the properties are filled, the 
initiator assigns a task to another user or group. In this case, it is assigned to user. 
Now the task appears in dashlets of assigned user. The Assignee fills the properties 
of the task bookwcmwf:verifyBrokenLinksTask and clicks on the abort button.  
The abort transition would call Alfresco JavaScript that sends an e-mail. And an 
end-state event will log the end of the workflow.
We are now ready to create a Process Definition file and use the workflow model we 
developed earlier for our case study.
Create a file book-serial-group-processdefinition.xml in the specified location 
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension. Copy the 
downloaded content into the file.
For reference go to http://wiki.alfresco.com/
wiki/WorkflowAdministration.
Step 3: Create the workflow Resource Bundles
For localized workflow interaction it is necessary to provide Resource Bundles 
containing UI labels for each piece of text that is exposed to the user. With the 
appropriate Resource Bundles, a single workflow instance may spawn tasks where 
the user interface for each task is rendered in a different language, based on the 
locale of the user. Specific structure has to be followed in order to define labels for UI 
in Resource Bundle.
<model_prefix>_<model_name>.[title|description] 
<model_prefix>_<model_name>.<model_element>.<element_prefix>_ 
         <element_name>.[title|description] 
Add all the properties that relate to this Process Definition and model.
bookwcmwf_bookworkflow.workflow.title=Book Workflow
      bookwcmwf_bookworkflow.node.verifybrokenlinks.transition.abort.
title=Abort Submission
        bookwcmwf_workflowmodel.type.bookwcmwf_reviewTask.description=
Review Documents to approve or reject them
Create a file book-serial-group-messages.properties in the specified location, 
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension. Copy the 
downloaded content into the file.

Chapter 5
[ 189 ]
Step 4: Create the Alfresco Explorer Task dialogs
The custom web client configuration file contains information on how to display 
these custom Content Types, Aspects, and Associations. You need to make sure that 
the web client program recognizes this new custom aspect and displays it in the web-
based interface. In order to make this happen, you need to configure the web client 
file, web-client-config-custom.xml, in the extension folder.
Open the web-client-config-custom.xml file from the specified location 
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension. Copy the 
downloaded content into the file.
Step 5: Create a custom model Spring Context file
The custom model context file defines the Spring bean that will be used to bootstrap 
the definition of your custom Model, Workflow, and Resource Bundle. It lists one or 
more custom Model files, Workflow files, and Resource Bundles. When Spring starts 
up, it will instantiate this bean and will load your files from the disk.
Create a custom model context file and name the file as <your-custom-model-
name>-context.xml, for example, bookWorkflowModel-context.xml. Create 
the file in the specified location <install-alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/
alfresco/extension. Copy the downloaded content in the file.
Download the complete code samples from the Packt website. It is very 
important for you to note that the Alfresco server recognizes context files.
Step 6: Deploy into WCM project
In order to identify this workflow for WCM, open the web-client-config-wcm.xml 
file from the specified location <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/
WEB-INF/classes/alfresco and insert the highlighted XML code within the 
workflows tag, as follows:
<workflows>
            wcmwf:submit ,bookwcmwf:bookworkflow

Expiring content in WCM
For any changes promoted to the site, specific expiration dates can be set on a global 
or asset-by-asset basis. Expiration is the only indication that the content is expired. 
The content is not disabled or hidden in the Staging Sandbox. Upon expiration, 
end users are automatically assigned the asset as a task so that they can determine 
whether the asset should be updated or removed from the site.
The repository checks periodically for expired items. When any expired items are 
found they are added to a workflow and sent to the user that last modified the asset. 
If multiple items are destined for the same user, they are batched up into a workflow 
for each website the asset belongs to.
Clicking on the task will launch the Manage Task dialog that lists all of the expired 
items, from here the assigned user can perform the relevant action on each item. 
These changes occur in isolation from the user's sandbox, thus not affecting any 
work that they may currently be doing in their sandbox. The workflow, however, is 
layered over the user's sandbox so any changes that they have made in their sandbox 
will be visible.
Configuration
Configuration for content expiration is in one file—scheduled-jobs-context.xml. 
You'll find the file in the Alfresco package, that is tomcat-home/webapps/alfresco/
WEB-INF/classes/alfresco /scheduled-jobs-context.xml. It contains the 
configuration for the frequency of expired item checks. By default it is set to check 
once a day at 3:30 a.m. as can be seen in the following cron expression:

      <property name="cronExpression">
             <value>0 30 3 * * ?</value>
      </property>
</bean>
You can make the changes for cron expression and check the expiration  
date functionality.
Changes can be also made directly to these files, but better practice would suggest 
to make changes in content-expiration-debug-context.xml.sample located at 
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/.
Rename the file to content-expiration-debug-context.xml.
Paste the previous code with changes in cron expression as suggested in  
the following:
<property name="cronExpression">
             <value>0 3 * * * ?</value>
</property>
This will run the scheduler in every three minutes and will check for the  
expired item.

Open the Manage Task dialog. The dialog displays two buttons as shown in the 
following screenshot. Both signal that all changes have been made and will therefore 
apply the changes to the user's sandbox. The bottom button, Task Done & Re-
Submit All, will immediately launch the Submit dialog so that the users can submit 
their changes. Whereas the Task Done button will just apply the changes and users 
can then pick and choose when and which items to submit.
Summary
Workflows are an important aspect in Alfresco WCM. Alfresco web project uses 
workflows to support any set of changes, either automated or user-driven steps, in a 
business process before final commit to the Staging Sandbox. In this chapter we have 
learned the following points:
• 
Alfresco includes two flows of workflows out of the box. One is serial 
oriented and the other one is the parallel workflow.
• 
Auto review of date for submission can be made using launch and  
expiry date.
• 
Workflow can be configured for a web form and web project.
• 
Whenever content is submitted, a snapshot is automatically taken of staging 
to provide an archive of the current version of the site.

Dynamic Deployment and 
Customizations
The dynamic model feature enables dynamic customization of models without 
requiring a restart of the Alfresco server, and is also applicable to a multi-
tenant environment. This also includes dynamic reloading of the web client UI 
customizations. Customizations of workflows can be done easily.
By the end of this chapter you will have learned:
• 
The advantages of workflow
• 
How to enable dynamic customization of workflow without requiring a 
restart of the Alfresco server
• 
The process of customizing an existing workflow
• 
How to remove workflow for a specific staging submission
• 
How to configure a ZERO workflow
• 
How to implement workflow viewer to see the pending list of workflows
Dynamic deployment
You are able to dynamically deploy workflow in Alfresco WCM by using workflow 
types, workflow definitions, web client configurations, and property files. Since 
version 3.0, Alfresco supports dynamic deploy of models, workflows, messages, 
and web-client configuration changes to facilitate dynamic customization without 
requiring a restart of the Alfresco server. Let's discuss how to dynamically deploy 
models, workflows, messages, and web-client changes.
www.it-ebooks.info

Dynamic Deployment and Customizations
[ 204 ]
The following are the advantages of dynamic deployment:
• 
There is no need to restart the Alfresco server every time you make changes 
to the files.
• 
Both the content as well as the files are stored in the repository. It is easier to 
maintain and move content along with the files.
• 
You can activate and inactivate the dynamic models by keeping the model 
XML file in the repository. 
• 
You can deploy and undeploy the workflow definitions as and when required.
• 
In a multi-tenant setup, the files that are defined in the <extension> folder 
are available to all tenants. If you would like to customize workflow for a 
specific tenant only, then a dynamic deployment is the best choice.
Dynamic models
Dynamic models are nothing but XML-based model files. Creating a dynamic 
custom model is the same as creating a regular custom model. For this example, 
create a custom content type that has two properties. Create a file named 
dynamicWCMWorkflowModel on your personal computer with the  
downloaded content.
Download the complete code sample 
from Packt's website.
Deploying a model file
The Task Model can also be dynamically deployed without restarting the server.
This can be achieved by two ways:
• 
Uploading or creating the model file in the new 'Models' space (Company 
Home | Data Dictionary | Models).
• 
Using pre-registered URLs provided by the Alfresco Repository  
Admin Console.

Chapter 6
[ 205 ]
First approach
Dynamic workflow models are stored in the new 'Models' space (Company Home | 
Data Dictionary | Models).
Upload a custom XML model file, dynamicWCMWorkflowModel, to the 'Models' space. 
By default, the model will not be active unless the Model Active checkbox is selected 
during the upload. To activate a previously inactive model, select View Details 
and then select the Modify properties icon. In the Modify Content Properties page, 
select the Model Active checkbox.
To deactivate a model, select View Details and then select the Modify properties 
icon. In the Modify Content Properties page, unselect the Model Active checkbox.
Follow these steps to deploy a model dynamically:
1.	 Go to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Models.
2.	 In the header click on Add Content.
3.	 The Add Content Wizard is displayed. Upload the custom XML file.
4.	 In the Name textbox type dynamicWCMWorkflowModel.
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 The Modify Content Properties dialog is displayed. Check the Model Active 
property, as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	 Click on OK.

Dynamic Deployment and Customizations
[ 206 ]
To verify the changes, log out and log in if required.
Updating a custom model
You can directly edit or update the XML model file. If the model is active, then it will 
be reloaded. If the file is checked out, then the working copy will be ignored until 
such a time as the file is checked in.
Second approach
Deployment of model files can be achieved as an administrator using the URL  
http://<server-name>:<port>/alfresco/faces/jsp/admin/ 
repoadmin-console.jsp
You can use the following commands to activate or deploy the model.
activate model dynamicWCMWorkflowModel.xml: This command is used to set the 
repository model to active and load into runtime data dictionary.
deploy model alfresco/extension/dynamicWCMWorkflowModel.xml: This 
command uploads the model to the repository and loads it into runtime data 
dictionary. This will also set the repository model as active.
Dynamic Resource Bundles
Creating a Dynamic Resource Bundle is the same as creating a regular property file. 
For this example, create labels for two properties that are defined in the model file. 
Create a file named dynamicWCMWorkflowMessages on your personal computer with 
the following content:
dynamic_processTask.workflow.title=Dynamic Workflow
dynamic_processTask.workflow.description=Dynamic Workflow for approval
Deploying a Resource Bundle
The Resource Bundle can also be dynamically deployed without restarting  
the server.
This can be achieved by two ways:
• 
Uploading or creating the message file in the new Messages space (Company 
Home | Data Dictionary | Messages).
• 
Using the Repository Admin Console provided by Alfresco.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
[ 207 ]
First approach
The associated message Resource Bundles are stored in the new Messages space 
(Company Home | Data Dictionary | Messages). Upload the custom Resource 
Bundle by uploading each of the message property files (for all locales) to the 
Messages space. The messages will not be applied until they are explicitly reloaded 
or when the server is restarted.
Follow these steps to create a message:
1.	 Go to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Messages.
2.	 In the header, click on Add Content.
3.	 The Add Content Wizard is displayed. Upload the custom property file.
4.	 In the Name textbox type dynamicWCMWorkflowMessages.properties.
5.	 Click on OK.
The custom configuration will not be applied until it is explicitly reloaded (refer to 
the following section) or the server is restarted.

[ 208 ]
Reloading the Resource Bundle
If the Resource Bundle file has been added, edited, or updated, it can be dynamically 
reloaded by using the Alfresco Repository Admin Console via:
http://<server-name>:<port>/alfresco/faces/jsp/admin/ 
repoadmin-console.jsp
This has a single command, reload, which will cause the Resource Bundle to  
be reloaded.
reload messages dynamicWCMWorkflowMessages
Updating a Resource Bundle
You can directly edit or update the Resource Bundle file. Use the reload command 
to reflect the changes. If the file is checked out, then the working copy will be ignored 
until such a time as the file is checked in.
Second approach
They can be dynamically reloaded by using the Alfresco Repository Admin  
Console via: http://<server-name>:<port>/alfresco/faces/jsp/admin/
repoadmin-console.jsp.
The command deploy messages <resource bundle base name> will cause the 
message resource to be re-registered.
deploy messages alfresco/extension/dynamicWCMWorkflowMessages
Dynamic workflows
Dynamic workflows are nothing but XML-based Process Definition files. Creating 
a dynamic Process Definition is the same as creating a regular Process Definition 
file. For this example, create a custom Process Definition. Create a file named 
dynamicProcessDefinition on your personal computer with the  
downloaded content.
Download the code samples from 
Packt publisher's book website.
Deploying a Process Definition file
The Process Definition can also be dynamically deployed without restarting the server.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
[ 209 ]
This can be achieved by three ways:
• 
Uploading or creating the Process Definition file in the new  
Workflow Definitions space (Company Home | Data Dictionary | 
Workflow Definitions).
• 
Using JBoss jBPM Process Designer tool.
• 
Using pre-registered URLs provided by Alfresco workflow console.
First approach
The Process Definitions are stored in the new Workflow Definitions space 
(Company Home | Data Dictionary | Workflow Definitions). Upload a custom 
XML Process Definition file to the Workflow Definitions space. By default, the 
Process Definition will not be deployed unless the Workflow Deployed checkbox is 
selected during the upload.
Follow these steps to create a Process Definition:
1.	 Go to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Workflow Definitions.
2.	 In the header click on Add Content.
3.	 The Add Content Wizard is displayed. Upload the custom XML file.
4.	 In the Name textbox type dynamicProcessdefinition.xml. Click on OK.
5.	 Select the Workflow Deployed checkbox. By default, the Process Definition 
will not be deployed unless the Workflow Deployed checkbox is selected 
during the upload.
6.	 In the Workflow Engine Id type jbpm. The completed definition is shown in 
the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Dynamic Deployment and Customizations
[ 210 ]
7.	 Click on OK.
To verify the changes, log out and log in.
To undeploy a Process Definition, select View Details and then select the Modify 
properties icon. In the Modify Content Properties page, unselect the Workflow 
Deployed checkbox.
Second approach
JBoss jBPM also includes a graphical designer tool for authoring business processes. 
The most important feature of the graphical designer tool is that it includes support 
for both the tasks—that of the business analyst as well as the technical developer. 
This enables a smooth transition from business process modeling to the  
practical implementation.
Follow these steps for configuring the jBPM:
1.	 To implement this you have to download jBPM plugins from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%20Process%20
Designer/jbpm-jpdl-designer-3.1.7
2.	 Once the installation is over, restart Eclipse.
3.	 Go to File | New | Project. Expand jBoss JBPM and select Process Project 
as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 211 ]
4.	 Enter the Project Name and click on Next.
5.	 Select the jBPM location as mentioned in the following screenshot and click 
on Finish:
6.	 Copy the Process Definition code and paste it in the src/main/jpd package.
7.	 The process should look like the next screenshot:
8.	 Deploy it as mentioned ahead.

Following are the steps to be followed to deploy a workflow via JBoss jBPM Process 
Designer. This will deploy workflow without restart of the server.
1.	 Ensure the Alfresco server is up and running.
2.	 Click on the source tab and copy the content of the file 
dynamicProcessdefinition.
3.	 Click on the Deployment tab and enter the following information:
°°
Server Name = machine name where Alfresco is installed
°°
Server Port = port number assigned to Alfresco (default: 8080) 
°°
Server Deployer = /alfresco/jbpm/deployprocess
4.	 Click on Test Connection....
5.	 If all is OK, click on Deploy Process Archive....

Display of workflow images
If Hot Deployment is done, then we can see the workflow images that show the 
current status of workflow in Alfresco Explorer under the workflow outline section. 
The screenshots can be seen in the following sections when you test the workflows 
that are deployed through jPDL.
Modify these files:
• 
/jsp/workflow/start-workflow-wizard/workflow-options.jsp
• 
/jsp/workflow/manage-task-dialog.jsp
Change the rendered and expanded value to true as highlighted.
The modified code is as follows:
<a:panel rendered="true" id="workflow-outline"  
label="#{msg.workflow_outline}" progressive="true" expanded="true" 
border="white" bgcolor="white" titleBorder="lbgrey" 
expandedTitleBorder="dotted" titleBgcolor="white" 
styleClass="mainSubTitle">
Third approach
The workflow console can be used (as an alternative to the Alfresco Explorer) to 
deploy and undeploy Process Definitions. Its primary use is to test newly-developed 
workflow definitions. However, it also supports the debugging/diagnosis of current 
"in-flight" workflows. This can be deployed via http://<server-name>:<port>/
alfresco/faces/jsp/admin/workflow-console.jsp.
The command deploy <workflow-name> will cause the workflow to be deployed.
deploy alfresco/extension/dynamicProcessdefinition.xml
Dynamic Alfresco Explorer
A dynamic web client configuration file will have the same name as a custom web 
client configuration file. For example, create a web-client-config-custom.xml  
file, with the following content, to support the dynamic content type that you  
created earlier:
<config evaluator="node-type" condition="dynamic:initializeTask"
    replace="true">
   <property-sheet>
  <separator name="sep2" display-label-id="users_and_roles"
     component-generator="HeaderSeparatorGenerator" />
  <show-property name="dynamic:property" />

  replace="true">
  <property-sheet>
    <separator name="sep1" display-label-id="general" 
       component-generator="HeaderSeparatorGenerator" />
         <show-property name="bpm:taskId" />
         <show-property name="bpm:description"
           component-generator="TextAreaGenerator" read-only="true"/>
         <show-property name="bpm:comment"
           component-generator="TextAreaGenerator" />
         <separator name="sep2" display-label-id="wf_reviewers" 
            component-generator="HeaderSeparatorGenerator" />
         <show-association name="bpm:assignee"  
           display-label-id="wf_reviewers"
           read-only="true"/>
  </property-sheet>
</config>
Deploying Alfresco Explorer customizations
The web client configurations can also be dynamically deployed without restarting 
the server.
This can be achieved by two ways:
• 
Upload or create the Process Definition file in the new Workflow Definitions 
space (Company Home | Data Dictionary | Workflow Definitions).
• 
Using the pre-registered URLs provided.
Dynamic Alfresco Explorer customizations are stored in the new Web Client 
Extension space (Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Client Extension).
Upload a custom web-client-config-custom.xml file to the Web Client  
Extension space.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
[ 215 ]
The custom configuration will not be applied until it is explicitly reloaded or when 
the server is restarted.
Reloading web client customizations
If the web-client-config-custom.xml file has been added, edited, or updated, 
it can be dynamically reloaded by using the Alfresco Explorer configuration 
console via: http://<server-name>:<port>/alfresco/faces/jsp/admin/
webclientconfig-console.jsp.
This has a single command reload, which will cause the Alfresco Explorer 
configuration to be reloaded.
Using the dynamic approach you can deploy workflow in DM. In order 
to deploy it in WCM you have to make the change manually in web-
client-config-wcm.xml, as discussed earlier (see the Deploying into 
WCM Project section) in Chapter 5, WCM Workflows and then restart the 
server once. The dynamic approach can also be used if some changes 
are required after deployments so, no need to restart the server.

Testing the workflow
To assign workflow for a specific project, refer to the Associating workflows to web 
project section in Chapter 5. While submitting, the content task appears in user's 
dashlet. On clicking on the task, you find the screen shown in the following 
screenshot. The highlighted section, Workflow Outline, displays the diagram of the 
deployed Process Definition. This is visible since we have made hot deployment of 
the workflow. Now you can approve or reject the workflow:

Customization of existing workflow to 
use e-mail notifications
Alfresco provides an inbuilt Web Site Submission workflow to be associated with the 
web project. If you want to make change in the existing workflow, following are the 
location of the files to make the changes.
1.	 The Process Definition file is present in the specified location:
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/workflow/submit_processdefinition.xml.
2.	 The Task Model file is also present at same location:
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/workflow/wcmWorkflowModel.xml.
3.	 The Resource Bundle is also present at same location:
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/workflow/wcm-workflow-messages.properties.
4.	 The Spring Context file, which is used to load model, Process Definition, and 
Resource Bundle is present at the location:
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/bootstrap-context.xml.
5.	 The Alfresco Explorer Dialog is located at:
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/web-client-config-properties.xml.
Consider a case where you want to add an e-mail notification at the submission of 
content. It is easy to customize the workflow by adding the following code snippet 
that is highlighted:
<task name="wcmwf:submittedTask" swimlane="initiator">
    <timer duedate="5 seconds" transition="onsubmit">
     <action class= 
       "org.alfresco.repo.workflow.jbpm.AlfrescoJavaScript">
         <script>
            logger.log("WCM Submit Process: Triggering submit for " 
                         + bpm_workflowDescription);
         </script>
      </action>

You should receive an e-mail notification at the submission of content to the  
Staging box.
Remove workflow for specific staging 
submission
We have already configured workflows for blogs and training web content. There 
can be various reasons why you don't want to follow a complete process of workflow 
and have to submit the content directly. If we think of the out-of-the-box feature, 
then we have to remove the workflow for those web forms so that web content 
can be submitted directly. This is not a good practice sometimes when you are 
configuring a workflow or sometimes when you are removing a workflow for a 
particular web content.
In order to make the task simpler we have to customize the submit dialog  
using APIs.
Follow these steps to create two Java files:
1.	 Create a package com.book.web.bean.wcm, in Eclipse, in your project. For 
more details refer Chapter 2, Installation and Configuration.
2.	 Create a Java file ExtendedSubmitDialog and copy the downloaded content 
from the Packt website.
Please download the complete code 
from the Packt website.
3.	 Create a Java file ExtendedSubmitConfigureWorkflowDialog and copy the 
downloaded content from the Packt website.

ZERO Workflow
You are required to select a user or group whenever your workflows are processed 
to deploy content on the staging server. However, if you customize your workflow, 
the user group selection becomes optional.
Let's take the same example that we have used for the Dynamic deployment section.

Workflow Viewer
Suppose you want to see list of pending workflows. We can create a dashlet that will 
list down all the pending workflows for Groups (the same way you can also create 
for users). The list is quite useful for administrators.
Follow the steps to create dashlets:
1.	 Create a Java file CustomWorkflowStatusBean in the package com.book.
web.bean.wcm and paste the downloaded code from the Packt website.
2.	 Add the following code in the faces-config-custom.xml file:
<managed-bean>
  <managed-bean-name>CustomWorkflowStatusBean</managed-bean-name>
    <managed-bean-class>
      com.book.web.bean.wcm.CustomWorkflowStatusBean 
    </managed-bean-class>
    <managed-bean-scope>request</managed-bean-scope>
    <managed-property>
       <property-name>navigationBean</property-name>
       <value>#{NavigationBean}</value>
    </managed-property>
    <managed-property>
       <property-name>serviceRegistry</property-name>
       <value>#{ServiceRegistry}</value>
    </managed-property>
</managed-bean>
3.	 Create a JSP file workflow-status.jsp in the specified location <install-
alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/JSP/extension/dashlets/
folder. Paste the downloaded code from the Packt website.
4.	 Add the following code in the web-client-config-custom.xml file:
  <config evaluator="string-compare" condition="Dashboards">
    <dashboards>
      <dashlets>
       <dashlet id="wfstatus-bean" 
        label="In-flight Workflow Status"
        description="In-flight Workflow Status of invited project" 
        jsp="/jsp/extension/dashlets/workflow-status.jsp" />
      </dashlets>
    </dashboards>
  </config>
5.	 Run Ant to compile the code and create a JAR file in <install-alfresco>/
tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib.

6.	 Start the Alfresco server.
7.	 Log in as admin.
8.	 Configure In-flight Workflow Status dashlets. Refer to the Web Publishing 
dashlets section in Chapter 4, Web Content Production with Web Forms,  
to configure.
9.	 You will see the following screen that lists all the pending workflows:
Summary
Workflows can be deployed dynamically also. In this chapter we have learned the 
following points:
• 
The customization of workflow can be achieved using two approaches, 
manual and dynamic.
• 
E-mail notifications can be made to all the concerned people involved in the 
workflow process.
• 
Workflows for a specific Staging Sandbox submission can also be removed 
using some customization.
• 
Implementing ZERO workflow gives the flexibility to submit content using 
workflows without selecting any user/group.
• 
Workflow Viewer can be implemented to see the number of active 
workflows, which is good for administrators.

Content Delivery and 
Deployment
So far you have learned the content production capabilities of Alfresco using web 
projects, User Sandboxes, web forms, and workflow. This chapter introduces you to 
the content delivery and deployment features, of Alfresco. You will understand the 
concepts behind delivering static content as well as dynamic content to the external 
production servers. This chapter covers deployment to both live servers as well as to 
the test servers. This chapter also focuses on the auto deployment feature where the 
content can be scheduled to be delivered to the production servers automatically.
By the end of this chapter you will have learned how to:
• 
Install and configure File System Receiver (FSR)
• 
Use Alfresco Server Receiver (ASR)
• 
Set up the process for auto deployment
• 
Deploy to a test server
• 
Deploy directly from a workflow
• 
Set up hybrid deployment for both static and dynamic content

Content Delivery and Deployment

Introduction to content delivery
Alfresco provides a framework for pushing content from a stage (or authoring) 
server to live and test servers, as shown in the following figure:
The Alfresco content production environment produces an approved view of a web 
project called a snapshot. Consider each snapshot as a web project version. Alfresco 
deployment takes a snapshot and pushes it out to either live or test servers. Consider 
a sample scenario as shown in the following diagram, where the content from the 
stage server is deployed to live servers. When snapshot version 2 is deployed to 
live servers, then the Alfresco deployment engine only copies the files which are 
either new or modified and removes the files which are deleted when compared to 
snapshot version 1. The deployment engine is smart, which affects only few files 
rather than copying all of the files of a web project. Now that the snapshot version 2 
is live (deployed to live servers), the editorial staff may work on a future version 3.

Chapter 7
[ 231 ]
Let's say for some reason there is an issue with snapshot version 2, which is live. You 
have the option of rolling it back to the previous good version of snapshot version 
1. You can roll forward or you can roll back to a specific version of a web project 
snapshot version. This feature is very powerful even from a legal audit point of view, 
wherein you have an ability to reproduce the website as of a specific date.
Further, the deployment process may be automated so that it happens automatically 
when content is approved for publishing.
The deployment framework provides a flexible and highly-configurable system 
to allow you to tailor the system to your requirements. If the Alfresco-supplied 
components are not suitable, you can plug in your own authenticators, transport 
implementations, content transformers, and deployment targets.
Live server vs. Test server
Alfresco WCM enables previewing the content within the stage server environment. 
After content creation, the Editorial staff may preview web pages to verify the 
content, as well as the look and feel. Similarly the content reviewers and business 
owners may preview to review the web pages during the workflow process.
Because of this powerful feature, you may not need a separate test server to preview 
and approve the content. The stage server itself is used for both authoring and 
testing the content. Hence, the content is authored and approved on the stage server, 
and then deployed to the live servers directly.
However, there can be a situation where you may need a separate test server. For 
example, if you are deploying content to another frontend application outside of 
Alfresco such as a PHP or .NET application, or situations when the virtualization 
server is not capable of providing the preview. Starting with the version 2.2 release, 
Alfresco introduced the concept of a Test Server.
You deploy the content from a Staging Sandbox to the live server and you deploy the 
content from User Sandbox or from a workflow to the test server.
Static vs. Dynamic delivery model
Within the live or test server environment, you can push out content to a flat 
filesystem to be served up by Apache or IIS, or you can push your content into 
another runtime instance of Alfresco.

Content Delivery and Deployment
[ 232 ]
Pushing content to a flat filesystem environment is also known as Static Deployment 
and it is achieved using Alfresco File System Receiver (FSR). Pushing content to 
another runtime instance of Alfresco is also known as Dynamic Deployment and it 
is achieved using Alfresco Server Receiver (ASR).
In static deployment, the web pages are already rendered (or baked) before 
deploying. In dynamic deployment, since the content is in the runtime instance of 
Alfresco, the web pages will be generated (or fried) at runtime. The following is a 
summary of static and dynamic delivery models:

You can consider a hybrid deployment (both static and dynamic) for some business 
applications. You can define certain static content of the web project such as images, 
videos, and scripts to be deployed to the filesystem and certain dynamic content 
such as web pages to be deployed to the Alfresco runtime. This approach gives you 
good performance as well as personalized and dynamically changing content in a 
production environment.

FSR for static delivery
A File System Receiver (FSR) will need to be installed and configured on each live or 
test server to receive published static content from the Alfresco Staging Server.
The FSR is a small, standalone server that receives updates from an Alfresco 
repository running Web Content Management; content is published to a flat 
filesystem. The published flat files will typically be served by a web server such as 
Apache, for static content or an application server such as Tomcat, JBoss, or IIS for 
web applications (WARs, PHP files, and so on).
FSR requires filesystem access and must run as a user with appropriate rights to 
the target filesystem. The FSR is a standalone Java Daemon (no Tomcat or other 
app server required) and it has minimal resource requirements. The FSR supports 
the invocation of custom Java code and/or programs. Therefore, it can be used to 
perform additional tasks post-deployment such as search engine indexing, pushing 
content to a Content Delivery Network (CDN), or replicating content to other 
systems or repositories.
The destination file server receiver has to be running with its RMI registry port and 
service port (44100 and 44101 by default) opened.
Installing FSR
If you refer to SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/alfresco/
files/, you will notice three different downloads of FSR. A Microsoft Windows 
installer file (Alfresco-DeploymentCommunity-3.3-Setup.exe), a Linux installer 
file (Alfresco-DeploymentCommunity-3.3-Linux-x86-Install) for automatic 
installation, and a ZIP file (alfresco-community-deployment-3.3.zip) for manual 
installation. I would prefer using the ZIP file and manually installing the standalone 
deployment receiver. Both Windows and Linux installers have certain limitations as 
they do not provide configuring various deployment targets.
Unzip the deployment ZIP file into a convenient location (it does not make its own 
directory) on a live or test server. Notice a file named deployment.properties, 
which contains the configuration information. The folder deployment includes 
default target information.
To configure the filesystem receiver, open the deployment.properties file in the 
text editor of your choice. Choose locations for each of the following:
; filesystem receiver configuration
deployment.filesystem.datadir=D:/07_MUN_WORK/alfresco_book_wcm_32e/

• 
deployment.filesystem.datadir: This is the location in which the 
filesystem deployment receiver stores deployed files during a deployment, 
before committing them to their final locations.
• 
deployment.filesystem.logdir: This is the location in which the 
filesystem deployment receiver stores deployment time log data.
• 
deployment.filesystem.metadatadir: This is the location in which the 
filesystem deployment receiver stores metadata about deployed content.
• 
deployment.filesystem.autofix: The file system deployment target 
can either issue an error upon detecting a problem or automatically fix 
the problem. The autofix parameter controls whether the File System 
Deployment Target will attempt to fix the metadata itself or just issue a 
warning. Set the value to true to fix, or false to not fix.
• 
deployment.filesystem.errorOnOverWrite: The file system deployment 
target can issue an error upon overwriting the files. Set the value to false to 
overwrite the files, which is needed when updating the existing files.
• 
deployment.rmi.port: The port number to use for the RMI registry. Choose 
this so as not to conflict with any other services. By default, the standalone 
deployment receiver uses 44100.
• 
deployment.rmi.service.port: The port number to use for RMI service. 
Choose this so as not to conflict with any other services. By default this  
is 44101.
Note that while specifying the directory locations on Microsoft Windows, either  
use forward slashes or escape the backslashes. For example, C:/dir1/dir2 or  
C:\\dir1\\dir2.

Configuring your deployment targets
You can configure as many target filesystem receivers as you need on a single 
live or test server. By default, a single filesystem receiver is defined with simple 
configuration via deployment.properties.
Deployment targets are placed in the deployment folder with the filename 
deployment/*target.xml. To define more targets, follow the pattern of 
deployment/default-target.xml. There are two steps involved:
1.	 Definition of your target information in the deployment.properties file
2.	 Registration of your target with the deployment engine using an XML file
Let's create a deployment target for the CIGNEX website and let's name it as 
cignex-live1 target. As a first step to configure filesystem receiver, open the 
deployment.properties file in the text editor of your choice and add the cignex-
live1 filesystem target configuration as follows:
; cignex-live1 filesystem target configuration
deployment.filesystem.cignex-live1.metadatadir= ${deployment.
filesystem.metadatadir}/cignex-live1
deployment.filesystem.cignex-live1.rootdir=
D:/07_MUN_WORK/alfresco_book_wcm_32e/deployment-data/targets/cignex-
live1
deployment.filesystem.cignex-live1.name=cignex-live1
deployment.filesystem.cignex-live1.user=admin
deployment.filesystem.cignex-live1.password=admin
Now to register this new target, you need to create a target XML file in the 
deployment folder. You can refer to an existing target file, default-target.xml, in 
the deployment folder for more information.
Copy deployment/default-target.xml as the deployment/cignex-live1-
target.xml file. Open the deployment/cignex-live1-target.xml file in your text 
editor of choice and replace the keyword default with the keyword cignex-live1.
With these simple two steps, you have configured a new target named cignex-live1.
Start and stop deployment receiver
To run the receiver, execute deploy_start.sh (or deploy_start.bat) as the user 
on that server. Remember this user will be the owner of the deployed content.
To stop the receiver, execute the deploy_stop.sh or deploy_stop.bat file.

Reverting or rolling back to an older snapshot
Snapshots can be reverted, compared to the previous snapshot, and compared  
to any snapshot by selecting the appropriate actions icon as shown in the  
following screenshot:
Let's say for some reason there is an issue with snapshot version 4, which is live. You 
can revert to a previous and stable snapshot version 3. In order to revert to a specific 
snapshot, click on the Revert icon and select the targets to revert to.
For the deployment Status, there could be four possible values:
• 
IN PROGRESS: Deployment is occurring on one or more servers
• 
LIVE: All servers were deployed to successfully
• 
PARTIAL FAILURE: Deployment failed on one or more servers
• 
FAILED: Deployment failed on all servers

Deploying to multiple servers
On a specific receiving server (FSR), you can configure more than one target. For 
example, you can deploy images to a doc-root of the Apache web server (say target1) 
and you can also deploy videos to a streaming server (say target2). Similarly, you can 
install and configure FSR on multiple servers.
To configure multiple deployment receivers, follow the instructions given in this 
chapter in the Configuring a web project to use FSR section.
In the Add Deployment Receiver form, use the Source Path field to specify a folder 
for the web project to be deployed. Also use the Excludes field to exclude certain 
types of files to be deployed.
Advanced topics on FSR
This section covers a few advanced features that are useful to extend the  
File System Receiver.
Configuring prepare and postCommit callbacks
On the target receiving servers, the FSR can be extended by implementing a 
prepare() or postCommit() callback. The prepare() callback is called after all files 
have been successfully deployed to the FSR's temporary storage areas before actually 
copying them to the target location. The postCommit() callback is called after the 
files are successfully copied to the target location.

Chapter 7
[ 243 ]
These two callbacks allow the developers to implement processing on deployed 
content through the use of a system command, script, or Java class.
Some examples are:
• 
Re-indexing of external search engine for newly added content in  
the filesystem
• 
Integrating with a third-party system, such as updating a database upon 
receipt of certain files
• 
Copying files to an external filesystem via FTP
• 
Sending e-mail notification upon failure or success of deployment
Refer to the deployment/file-system-target-sample.xml file, which includes 
prepare and postCommit blocks listed as folows:
<!--  Add your prepare callbacks here -->
<property name="prepare">
  <list>
    <bean class="org.alfresco.deployment.SampleRunnable" />
  </list>
</property>
<!--  Add your postCommit callbacks here -->
<property name="postCommit">
    <list>
      <bean class="org.alfresco.deployment.SampleRunnable" />
    </list>
</property>
Defining payload transformations
The data that streams out of Alfresco and into the FSR can be transformed by content 
transformation. On the Alfresco server, content transformers are defined in the 
configuration file deployment-service-context.xml. On the File System Receiver, 
transformers are defined in the configuration file application-context.xml.
Following are a few use cases listed for your reference.
• 
File compression for slow networks
• 
Encryption of sensitive data
• 
Transformation of content as it is deployed

Here is an extract from deployment-service-context.xml showing the 
configuration of the encryption transformer, which takes two parameters:
<!--  Payload transformers -->    
<bean id="deploymentEncryptor" class="org.alfresco.deployment.
transformers.SampleEncryptionTransformer">
    <property name="password">
      <value>Alfresco</value>
    </property>
    <property name="cipherName">
      <value>PBEWithMD5AndDES</value>
    </property>
</bean>
Defining transport adapters
The Alfresco deployment service supports the configuration of multiple transport 
adapters to enable connection to remote filesystem receivers using different network 
protocols (that is, encrypted RMI).
Transport adapters are configured on the Alfresco Staging Server in the Spring 
configuration file deployment-service-context.xml. An instance of the Alfresco 
server may support many different transports. However, each deployment receiver 
only exposes a single transport as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 245 ]
ASR for dynamic delivery
The Alfresco System Receiver (ASR) is just another instance of the Alfresco Server. 
It is also known as headless Alfresco, as the Web Client UI is not used. Also some 
features such as CIFS, WebDAV, FTP, and NFS are disabled.
The ASR allows a web project being authored in one Alfresco server instance to 
be deployed to another separate instance of Alfresco. ASR provides the ability to 
leverage search, versioning, and dynamic queries (via web scripts) within a live 
server environment—thereby making the content available for dynamic queries by 
basically any web technology (PHP, Python, J2EE, ASP .NET, AJAX, Flash, Cold 
Fusion, and so on). This provides ultimate flexibility in what and how the content is 
displayed on a page.
From Alfresco 3.2 version onwards ASR is replaced 
by the client-side WCM Deployment Service and 
receiver-side AVM Deployment Target.
The WCM deployment service is the staging (sending) side of WCM deployment. 
The AVM Deployment Target is a target which is registered with the receiving side 
of deployment. By default its target name is "avm", although of course this can be 
changed through configuration. The AVM Deployment Target receives a deployment 
from an Alfresco WCM authoring environment and puts the content into an AVM 
store where it can be used to support a dynamic website.
Configuring WCM deployment service
You can configure the WCM deployment service by editing the settings in the 
<tomcatHome>/shared/classes/extension/deployment-service-context.xml 
file.

Number of send threads
To assist with cases where files are being deployed over a network with high latency, 
the deployment client is multi-threaded and sends several files at once. By default, 
five sends are done in parallel.
From 3.2 Enterprise onwards you can set the deployment.service.
numberOfSendingThreads property in the alfresco-global.properties file.
Number of deployments in parallel
Deployment is controlled through the Action Service which controls how many 
deployments happen in parallel. If you need to deploy to many servers, then you 
may need to increase the number of deployments in parallel. But if you run out of 
processing power or memory, then you may need to reduce this setting.
From 3.2 Enterprise onwards you can set the following properties in the alfresco-
global.properties file.
deployment.service.corePoolSize=2
deployment.service.maximumPoolSize=3
AVM Deployment Target
The AVM Deployment Target is a target that is registered with the receiving side of 
deployment. By default its target name is "avm".
The ASR names the live and stores the same as the staging store. This is fine in most 
cases except for where the ASR is used to deploy to the same machine that has the 
authoring instance. In this case, the ASR attempts to avoid a circular dependency (or 
overwriting the source) by appending the destination store name with '-live'.
In order to have consistency between deploying to a local instance and deploying 
to a remote instance, the AVM deployment target always names live stores with the 
'-live' prefix. For example, if your web project name is "cignex" (on Staging Server), 
then on the ASR destination Alfresco server, the name of the web project would  
be "cignex-live".
Auto deployment
Alfresco WCM staging has an autodeploy option in its default workflow, allowing 
end users, at the time of submit, to enforce automatic deployment of approved 
changes directly to the live website without having to manually initiate deployment.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
[ 247 ]
The Submit Items window has an Auto Deploy checkbox, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
Upon approval, if the auto deploy option is on, the workflow will perform a 
deployment to those live servers that have the Include In Auto Deploy option 
enabled. For more details about enabling this option, refer the Configuring a web 
project to use FSR section in this chapter.
Deploying to a test server
The Test Server Deployment functionality provides in-context preview by allowing 
a contributor to deploy their content to an external target (either an ASR or FSR), 
from which it can be rendered by any web application technology that can either 
read from a filesystem or access an ASR via HTTP (which includes all of the major 
web application technologies in use today, including Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, Python, 
CGI, and so on).
Once a test server has been deployed to, it is allocated to the user or workflow 
that performed the deployment. Once the user or workflow has finished with 
the test server it is released and returned to the pool of test servers. This happens 
automatically in the case of a workflow sandbox and manually via a UI action for 
User Sandboxes.

Preview the content
You can preview the content deployed on the test server either using Apache or 
application servers such as Tomcat or PHP, as per your FSR configuration settings.
Release the test server
Once a test server has been deployed to, it is allocated to the user or workflow that 
performed the "Deploy".
The administrator or content manager can see what test server is allocated to which 
sandbox by going to the Edit Web Project Wizard and viewing the Allocated field. 
Hovering over the Yes label will reveal the actual store name as a tooltip.
Test servers allocated to User Sandboxes can be released by the owner of the 
sandbox, the administrator, or the content manager. The Release Server option is 
available in the More Actions menu as shown in the following screenshot. A user 
can also view the deployment history by clicking on the View Deployments option 
available in the More Actions menu:

Test servers allocated to review sandboxes are automatically released by the system 
upon completion of the workflow. Once the user or workflow has finished with the 
test server, it is released and returned to the pool of test servers.
Deploying from workflow
When you have a test server configured, you can deploy the content to that test 
server from the workflow process, similar to the way you deployed it from User's 
Sandbox. Refer to the following screenshot. You don't have to explicitly release 
the test server. Test servers allocated to the workflow review sandboxes are 
automatically released by the system upon completion of the workflow:

Deploying from Alfresco WCM to DM 
repository
Starting from Alfresco 3.3 version onwards, the WCM deployment facilities have 
been enhanced to add an additional deployment target. This additional deployment 
receiver allows the WCM content, authored and stored in Staging Sandbox, to be 
deployed to local and remote Alfresco repositories (Alfresco DM) as shown in the 
following figure.
The DM Deployment Target receives a deployment from an Alfresco WCM 
authoring environment and puts the content into the workspace spaces store where 
it can be used to support a dynamic website. This feature provides greater flexibility 
in moving an approved staging content from WCM to DM (Document Management). 
The Alfresco Deployment Receiver is configured as a sub-system, and a new Data 
Dictionary folder Web Deployed is configured by default as the deployment target.
Setting up Alfresco DM as the deployment 
target
In order to set up Alfresco DM as the deployment target, you will have to edit the 
global properties file and then restart Alfresco.
Go to the /tomcat/shared/classes/ folder, open the alfresco-global.properties 
file, and add the following two lines:
deployment.dmr.consolidate=true  
deployment.dmr.name=alfresco
Now restart Alfresco to activate the deployment target.

[ 253 ]
The DM Deployment Target is a target that is registered with the repository-based 
WCM Deployment Engine. By default, its target name is "alfresco". Although of 
course, this can be changed through the configuration deployment.dmr.name.
The authoring environment for a WCM web project consists of a set of related 
AVM stores. The different stores have a naming convention for their store names. 
The consolidate flag (deployment.dmr.name=true) says to deploy all of these 
related stores to the same location. If it is turned off by setting deployment.dmr.
consolidate to false, there will be a separate path for each store and content will be 
duplicated in the DM store.
Deploying to DM
Go to the Alfresco WCM web project and configure the DM deployment receiver. 
The following are the steps to configure the DM deployment receiver from Alfresco 
WCM Project.
1.	 Navigate to Company Home | Web Projects | <web project name>.
2.	 Select Edit Web Project Settings from the Action menu.
3.	 Click on Next to reach the Configure Deployment Servers window.
4.	 Click on the Add Deployment Receiver link and fill up the following values 
in the form:
Type = Live Server
Display Name = [Some Name]
Transport Name = default
Host = [localhost for local server or enter host name or IP address for 
external server]
Port = 50500
Username = Target Alfresco DM username
Password = Target Alfresco DM password
Target Name = alfresco
5.	 Click on the Add button and then the Finish button.
6.	 Now go to that WCM project's Staging Sandbox and deploy a snapshot to the 
new DM target.

Managing Multiple Websites 
Using WCM
This chapter covers information about managing multiple web projects using one 
installation of Alfresco WCM. This means you can leverage a single instance of 
Alfresco WCM to stage and manage many websites. This chapter focuses on  
reusing assets such as images, forms, and workflows across multiple web projects. 
This chapter also introduces you to a concept called "layered folder", where you 
could logically use a folder in many websites without copying the content in 
multiple places.
By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to:
• 
Configure and use multiple web projects
• 
Reuse forms, templates, and workflows across many websites
• 
Use a single set of media assets across multilingual websites
• 
Set up and use layered folders

Multiple web projects
Within a single instance of Alfresco you can create as many web projects as you can.
You can have common assets shared across many of these web projects. Once 
created, you can use the same web forms, templates, workflows, and deployment 
targets across multiple projects. You can also have the same set of users managing 
these multiple sites. For example, a user could be a Content Manager on Web 
Project1 and Content Reviewer on Web Project2.
Reusing forms, templates, and workflows
When creating a new project or editing the web project settings, you will notice 
the list of all of the available web forms. Basically, the forms that are defined in 
Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Forms are available to all of the web 
projects along with templates and workflows associated with those forms.

You can add the selected web forms to a project by clicking on the Add to List 
button, as shown in the following screenshot:
Once a web form is added to a web project, you can overwrite the form details 
such as the output filename pattern, you can configure the workflow locally as per 
the web project approval process, and you can also configure the output template 
settings as shown in the following screenshot. These are very flexible ways of 
defining the forms and workflows globally, and overwriting them locally:
www.it-ebooks.info

Managing Multiple Websites Using WCM
[ 258 ]
Using a web project as a template
In some scenarios you might want to create web projects that are similar in nature. 
For example, marketing websites for each product might have similar features, 
and they might be managed by the same set of people following similar workflow 
approval processes. The customer extranet websites for each of your customers 
might fall into this category.
In such scenarios using a typical website as a template to recreate many such 
websites will not only save you time, but also sets a well-defined process in the 
organization. You can select such a web project as a template, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Now while creating a similar website, you can create a new web project based on an 
existing template web project. The Staging Sandbox structure, web forms, workflow, 
and users will be copied from the selected web project. This must be done while 
creating a new web project, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 8
[ 259 ]
Once a new web project is created, you can always overwrite the existing 
configuration. You can also create new forms, workflows, and structures as needed.
Managing multiple websites using a 
single web project
You can also use a single web project to have multiple websites. You can group all 
of the assets related to a website into a folder in a web project. Hence, a web project 
could have many such folders and each one could be interpreted and managed as  
a website.
This approach is better when compared to having a separate web project for each 
website if you have the following requirements:
• 
All of the content in these websites have similar workflow approval processes
• 
The content is managed by the same set of people
• 
All of the websites have a similar look and feel
• 
The deployment (going live) to the product server or servers for all of these 
websites happens at the same time
Basically, this is good for small to medium websites where majority of the content  
is static.
Setting up multiple URLs on the target server
One scenario could be deploying all of the folders to a specific target server. On that 
target server you could use web server proxy to have a specific URL pointing to a 
specific folder, as shown in the following diagram:
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Managing Multiple Websites Using WCM
[ 260 ]
Setting up FSR for each target website
Another scenario could be deploying selected folders to a specific live server as 
shown in the following diagram. This can be done by using the Source Path and 
Excludes fields of deployment, while configuring the FSR on a stage server. Refer to 
Chapter 7, Content Delivery and Deployment for more details on deployment:
Creating many webapp folders
Another way of creating multiple websites within a web project is to use multiple 
webapp folders.
The webapp folder is the web application folder used in application servers such as 
Tomcat or JBoss. A web application exists as a structured hierarchy of directories. 
The root of this hierarchy serves as a root for serving files that are part of this context. 
For example, for a web application located at site2 in a web server, the index.html 
file located at the base of the web application hierarchy can be served to satisfy a 
request to http://some_url/site2/index.html.
In Alfresco WCM, each web project has only one web application (webapp) folder 
and it is named as ROOT. To create another webapp folder for a specific web project, 
navigate to the Actions drop-down menu and click on Create Webapp Folder:

You can also change the default web application. Click on Edit Web Project Settings 
from the Actions drop-down menu and change the setting in the Default Webapp 
field as shown in the following screenshot:
Layered folders
Large enterprises usually run global operations. In order to have effective services, 
sales and marketing, they usually have many regional websites. Most often the 
information in these websites is 80 percent common (global) and 20 percent different 
(local). However, enterprises end up replicating or duplicating the 80 percent of such 
common information in each and every regional website.
Let's consider a scenario where an enterprise is having two websites, one for USA-
based customers and the other one for UK-based customers with the pages and files 
as shown in the following image:
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Managing Multiple Websites Using WCM
[ 262 ]
In order to make the USA website contents of the /Images and /Products 
directories on the UK website, you would have two options:
• 
Option 1 is to make a separate copy for the UK website. It means a specific 
file has two different copies. The issue with this approach is that if the USA 
website updates an image (say product1.jpg), then those updates are not 
applied on the UK website. You need to make sure you update those changes 
on the UK website as well. If the size of the website is large with hundreds 
and thousands of files and pages, then it will be very expensive to maintain 
two copies of the files.
• 
Option 2 is to make a symbolic link of the USA website for UK. Now any 
updates done on the USA website are seen on the UK website as well. It is 
like an alias or a Unix-style symbolic link. The advantage of this approach is 
that there is only one copy of files to manage, which is easier. This issue with 
this approach is that if the UK website needs to make a few changes to a page 
(say product2.html), then it is not possible.
Alfresco WCM provides a strong feature called Transparent Folder where it is 
possible to have both option 1 and 2. You can have only one copy of the files to 
maintain globally and also have the flexibility to update a few of them locally.
For example, consider that the UK website uses Images and Products as two 
transparent folders from the USA website. It means that the USA website has the 
master copy (only one copy) and the UK website has symbolic links to those folders.
Now any updates done in the USA website will automatically be seen on the UK 
website. Say you updated product1.jpg on the USA website, then the changes are 
seen on the UK website.
If you make any modifications to the files on the UK website, then a separate copy 
of that file alone will be created on the UK website. For example, if you update 
product2.html on the UK website, then a separate copy is made for that file for 
the UK website. From this point onwards, there will be two separate copies of the 
product2.html file with different versions and content in these two websites.
Creating a transparent folder
Let's create a web project with a few folders and files.
1.	 Create a web project called USA Web Site.
2.	 Go to User Sandbox and create folders called Images and Products.
3.	 In the Images folder, add two images (say product1.jpg and  
product2.jpg).
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 8
[ 263 ]
4.	 In the Products folder, add two HTML pages (say product1.html and 
product2.html).
5.	 Submit all of these files and folders to the Staging Sandbox.
6.	 Browse the Staging Sandbox to view these folders and files.
Now create another web project called UK Web Site. Do not create any folders or 
files in UK Web Site. Go to the Staging Sandbox of the UK Web Site and click on the 
Create Layered Folder link as shown in the following screenshot:
You can create a layered folder using a target folder from a target web project. Create 
the Images folder in the UK Web Site, using the Images target folder from the USA 
Web Site target web project as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 264 ]
It is not mandatory to use the same name for the 
layered folder as the target folder name.
You can use any name for the folder in the UK Web Site. It is not mandatory to use 
"Images" as folder name in the UK Web Site. However, to maintain simplicity and to 
avoid naming conflicts, it is advised to use the same folder names.
Similarly, you can link to any number of web projects and folders. For example, you 
can use the "Images" folder from the USA Web Site and "Videos" folder from the 
Germany website and so on.
You will notice that a new folder called Images is created in the UK Web Site with 
the Type specified as Layered Folder as shown in the following screenshot. Click on 
the Images folder and notice two images. These were the images that were created  
in the USA Web Site and are automatically available to the UK Web Site due to 
layered folder.
Similarly, create a transparent folder for the "Products" folder. Now you will notice 
two transparent folders in UK Web Site.
Updating a source file
Updating the file in USA Web Site will automatically update the file in  
UK Web Site.
Browse to USA Web Site | User Sandbox | Images and update the product1.jpg 
file. Submit the changes to the Staging Sandbox. Notice the timestamp of the file and 
also the versions as shown in the following screenshot.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 8
[ 265 ]
Now browse to the UK Web Site and notice that the image is updated automatically 
including the versions as shown in the next screenshot. Basically, the image is not 
updated; we are seeing the same image information through the link.
If a file is deleted in the source web project, the file will automatically be removed 
from the web projects where the parent folder is used as a layered folder.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Managing Multiple Websites Using WCM
[ 266 ]
Updating the destination file
If you make any modifications to the files in layered folder, then a separate copy of 
that file alone will be created. From that point onwards, they are considered as two 
different files.
Refer to the following screenshot. For example, if you update product1.jpg on the 
USA Web Site, then a separate copy is made in the UK Web Site. From this point 
onwards, there will be two separate copies of the product1.jpg file with different 
versions and content on these two websites.
Deleting files
If you delete a file from the source, then the file will automatically be deleted on all 
of the destinations. For example, if you delete a file product1.html in USA Web Site, 
then the file will automatically be removed from UK Web Site as well.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

[ 267 ]
On the other hand, if you remove product2.html from UK Web Site, then it is 
considered as a separate copy and the original file in source location (USA Web Site) 
will not be deleted.
Adding new files
If you add a file in a source, then the file will automatically be added in all the 
destinations. For example, if you add a file product3.html in USA Web Site, then 
the file will automatically be added to UK Web Site.
On the other hand, if you add product4.html in UK Web Site, then it is considered 
as a new addition only in the UK Web Site.
Summary
In Alfresco WCM, you can use a single web project to manage multiple websites. 
You can have many web projects in a single instance of Alfresco. These web projects 
can share common web forms, templates, and workflow. The layered folder concept 
is very powerful, where you get both efficiency and flexibility in managing content 
across multiple websites.

Sample Web Application using Alfresco Web Editor
Alfresco Surf platform
Alfresco Surf is a lightweight, scriptable web framework built on top of the Alfresco 
web scripts technology and Templating runtime. It provides a highly extensible 
and customizable web framework for page layout and a component framework for 
building web applications. It works well with web scripts, can remotely call web 
services (that is, REST), and also has multiple programming options. Applications 
built using Surf can be deployed on a standalone server. It has zero dependencies 
on the Alfresco repository but use it as a backend "model". A web application built 
using the Surf framework has many objects in places like pages, templates, themes, 
and components. Any application built using Surf can be deployed from the Alfresco 
Web Project, taking full advantage of Alfresco WCM's enterprise features.

[ 270 ]
Surf has been designed to leverage web-enabled tools that expose powerful 
capabilities such as inline editing, drag-and-drop positioning of content, point-
and-click template selection, and so on. These tools make it possible for users with 
little technical training to manage dynamic websites. Alfresco Surf is a lightweight, 
scriptable Java-based web framework that provides the ability to quickly create 
dynamic websites using concepts such as pages, templates, themes, and components. 
The Surf platform was designed to specifically make it:
• 
Lightweight (around 8 to 9 MB) and scriptable. No server restart or content 
reloading is required. You only need to refresh.
• 
Easy to customize by using XML configuration files and it also has a  
Developer API.
• 
Work well with Alfresco WCM—it reads and writes from the  
Alfresco repository.
• 
Equipped with an out-of-the-box and extensible Site Dispatcher, Component 
model, or Site construction model.
Applications built with Alfresco Surf can be considered as standalone and deployed 
on any application server. The application can also be used in Alfresco WCM and 
deployed from Alfresco Web Project spaces to production servers while making use 
of Alfresco WCM features. This gives the advantage to use many features of Alfresco 
WCM that are required for developing any website. Some of the features are listed  
as follows:
• 
Approval of Surf components using workflows
• 
Allows to make and preview changes without any additional  
server requirement
• 
All of the changes that are on the Staging box can roll back to any version
• 
Alfresco Surf-powered applications can retrieve all of their runtime data 
from the local disk, the classpath, or from the Alfresco repository via REST
The Surf platform consists of several integrated parts. To help facilitate this, the Surf 
platform uses a lightweight XML-driven model to store all model objects that make 
up the website. Model objects are things such as pages, templates, components, 
themes, and chrome.

Alfresco Surf RESTful platform uses Yahoo's YUI AJAX library and Adobe Flash for 
a more interactive user experience. Surf allows you to take a page and split it up into 
template and components. This allows for a total separation of the look and feel and 
the components. Both the template and the components have renderers to generate 
outputs. You can even use PHP renderers, that is, you can use the model of Alfresco 
but the actual page is rendered in PHP. Most of the Surf components are envisioned 
to be written using web scripts. With web scripts and their rich underlying API for 
extension, no Java coding or server restarts are the most common, and the most 
powerful, rendering facility. You can also build your own renderers or make use 
of the out-of-the-box renderers such as JSP, Java Bean FreeMarker Templates, and 
HTML available. Templates make it possible to define a page layout once and then 
reuse it across a large set of pages. In each of these template languages, the essential 
goal is to layout the placement of regions (or slots) into which components can be 
bound. You can create single- and two-tier applications.
Applications using the Alfresco Surf platform
The Surf platform is used by the Alfresco 3.0 release of products to provide a 
uniform suite of interchangeable functionality. These applications include:
• 
Alfresco Share: Enhanced collaboration and document management 
services. It provides out-of-the-box web client templates for creating social 
networking sites. These sites in turn use a rich library of downloadable and 
shareable themes, components, templates, and application logic.
• 
Alfresco Dynamic Website: This is aimed especially at business users, which 
allows the rapid self-assembly of web applications and web experiences with 
minimal IT intervention. Comes with an in-context, drag-and-drop toolkit 
and allows teams to construct their own web applications that feature user 
interactions and collaborations.
• 
Alfresco Network: Provides access to Alfresco news, ticket details and 
resolution, and new services, such as the Knowledge Base and the Web 
Component library. This is available to the Alfresco Enterprise users.
• 
Alfresco Web Editor: A visual, drag-and-drop designer for building websites 
with the Alfresco Surf platform. It features graphical overlays that facilitate 
the building of your website's pages, navigation structure, templates, and 
presentation layout. We will learn in detail about Web Editor in a later 
section of the chapter.

All of these applications are presently being built on top of the Surf platform. The 
Surf platform itself is a product that our community and customers may wish, and 
are encouraged, to use in building their own web applications.
Alfresco Surf architecture
Surf architecture shows a deep appreciation for the Web 2.0-inspired architecture 
and web application mash-ups. It's important to point out that although tools exist 
to reduce the need for technical skills, the platform does not eliminate or discourage 
access to its internals for those who need it.
Surf utilizes the MVC pattern using various components and objects. MVC stands for 
Model-View-Controller.
MVC pattern
The Dispatcher Servlet can be considered as a controller. It is responsible for 
rendering the view. It considers the incoming request context and decides what 
and how to render. It constructs the page view by looking at the related model 
components or templates to render using different possible rendering engines. The 
dispatcher can receive requests for the following:
• 
A specific page: A page ID may be given directly to the dispatcher.
• 
A type of page: For instance, the user may be requesting the login page. The 
application may actually have several login pages (for customers, employees, 
and so on) and it must select one and render it back.
• 
An object: An object ID may be given to the dispatcher. The dispatcher must 
then figure out which page to use to render this object.

• 
The Surf model: This can be considered as the model of the MVC 
architecture. Model is an entity that holds data. The Surf platform uses a 
lightweight XML-driven model to store all model objects that implement the 
majority of common websites and web application object types. XML files 
are effectively bound together to allow a page to be loaded and rendered. 
You can also define your own object model and extend the out-of-the-box 
object model. These include objects such as Pages, Templates, Components, 
Chromes, and Themes.
The XML is stored in sub-directories in the specified location: <install-
application>/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-data.
Within this directory, you will see the following sub-directories, one for each type of 
model object that is managed by the Surf platform:
   /site-data/chrome
   /site-data/component-types
   /site-data/components
   /site-data/configurations
   /site-data/content-associations
   /site-data/page-associations
   /site-data/page-types
   /site-data/pages
   /site-data/template-instances
   /site-data/template-types
   /site-data/themes
View (Renderers): View is for the presentation layer. The model objects such as 
components, templates, and page can be rendered using any of Surf's supported 
rendering engines, which internally return data in HTML, XML, JSON, and  
many more.
The view can be constructed using several rendering engines. These include:
Web scripts: Web scripts are used most commonly to render components. Web 
scripts themselves follow MVC architecture. The Web scripts take advantage of 
JavaScript (behaving as a controller), FreeMarker (for presentation processing), 
and model objects (for business logic). They can be stored in the specified location: 
<install-application>/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts.

[ 274 ]
JSP: The JSP renderer is used to render either components or templates, and provide 
you with access to the Java language and the Surf platform Java API. JSPs can be 
stored in the specified location: <install-application >/tomcat/webapps/
alfresco/jsp/components.
FreeMarker: FreeMarkers can be stored in the specified location: <install-
application>/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/templates.
By using the Surf framework you can create both single-tier and two-tier 
applications. Tiers can be considered as the physical deployment of different 
application layers.
Single-tier application
The user interface of a web application, the middleware, and the data access all 
are contained in one package. A system where all the layers are bundled together 
on a single server is generally single tier. Single-tier architecture has the interface, 
business logic, and database highly coupled. Installing Surf as is, with just the page 
layout and component framework, is single tier. A one-tier application also follows 
MVC. Here, model represents objects like pages, components, and templates, 
controller represents Dispatcher servlets, and renderer represents FTL and Web 
scripts. In this case, FTL code will be heavy, and rather than depending on other 
parties, it will call the User Interface framework optionally and will message data. 
It will also create data in the form of HTML or XML. If we have a complex User 
Interface, it is not advisable to keep the complete logic in one Web Script. In that 
case, we can develop the application using two tiers.

Chapter 9
[ 275 ]
Two-tier application
With two-tier client/server architectures the user system interface (Client) is usually 
located on the user's desktop environment and the database management services 
are usually in a server that is a more powerful machine that services many clients. 
Processing management is split between the user system interface environment 
and the database management server environment. The client performs most of the 
business logic as well as the presentation, updating shared data by communication 
with the database. Here we separate the data retrieval and data presentation part. 
So, one set of web scripts (Data web script), will be responsible for data retrieval and 
sending them in JSON, XML (ATOM), or other serialized data format present on the 
Repository tier. Another set of web scripts (Presentation web script) with some UI 
framework, may be YUI (Yahoo User Interface), will call those Data web scripts and 
will be responsible for rendering data present on Presentation tier in HTML format. In 
case of two-tier FTL or presentation web scripts, the code will be minimal and will be 
more centric to creating data in JSON/XML format. Consider the client is on one server 
(Presentation tier) accessing the Alfresco repository on a different server (Repository 
tier) using remote calls. Alfresco Share and Web Editor are two-tier applications, 
as they remotely connect to a different Alfresco repository using remote calls. The 
Alfresco Web Editor performs most of the business logic and presentation. It uses the 
Alfresco repository to fetch and store the data using Alfresco web scripts.

Surf model objects
In the Surf framework models are represented in the form of XML. XML files are 
effectively bound together to allow a page to be loaded and rendered. A model object 
contains information about site construction. Model defines pages, page layouts, 
and components within the page. We already had an overview about model in the 
previous section. Let's have an overview about these elements:
Objects
Description
Configuration
A Configuration object is a collection of XML, mostly used by the 
internal system. It is defined for a site.
Component Type
A Component Type is something that the website builder can grab 
at and instantiate in many places across the web application. They 
bind the new instances into pages by snapping them into regions 
(or slots). They can be considered as widgets.
Component
A Component is an instance of a Component Type that has been 
"bound" into a region.
Template Instance
It points to Free Marker renderer classes.
Template Type
It specifies FreeMarker or web scripts as the renderer.
Template renderer
It defines the look and feel of the page.
Page
A Page is the navigation page in a web application. It consists of 
templates and components.
Page Association
The Page Association objects allow you to link two pages together.
Content Association
It associates a document to the page. It can associate either a 
specific document or all documents of specific type and can be 
associated to a page instance or page type.
Chrome
Chrome describes border elements around a region or a 
component. Using Chrome, you can also include styling elements 
and drag-and-drop capabilities into a Page.
Surf API
We will learn some of the surf APIs used by presentation tier. The objects and 
methods are available to templates and components within Alfresco Surf. The main 
point to be noted is that these methods are not available for Repository-tier web 
scripts. Both FreeMarker template API and JavaScript API use the common object 
model. The list of commonly used root objects and methods is as follows:

We will first learn how to create a standalone application using the Surf framework 
without the use of Alfresco. For this you need to download surf.war and keep it in 
your web or application server. For this chapter, you can place the WAR file in the 
<install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps folder. This doesn't mean that we are using 
Alfresco for our development. You can also place the WAR file in any standalone 
server. Start your server. You will find that the surf.war file has exploded and the 
surf folder is created. You can see the following structure created by default:

Design a page
Follow the steps below to create a sample page:
• 
Step 1: Go to the <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/surf/WEB-INF/
classes/alfresco/site-data/configurations folder.
• 
Step 2: Open the default.site.configuration.xml file. Insert the 
highlighted code as mentioned below to create our home page:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <title>Sample Site Configuration</title>
  <description>Sample Site Configuration</description>
  <source-id>site</source-id>
  <properties><root-page>index</root-page></properties>
</configuration>
• 
Step 3: Go to the <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/surf/WEB-INF/
classes/alfresco/site-data/pages folder.
• 
Step 4: Create a new file with the name given previously in the root-page 
tag. Create the index.xml file. Insert the following code:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<page>
   <id>index</id>
   <title>CIGNEX | Open Source ECM, BPM , E Commerce , Portals  
   </title>
   <description>Sample Cignex home page</description>
   <template-instance>index</template-instance>
   <authentication>none</authentication>
</page>
• 
Step 5: Go to the <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/surf/WEB-INF/
classes/alfresco/site-data/template-instances folder.
• 
Step 6: Create a new file with the name given previously in the template-
instance tag. Create the index.xml file. Insert the following code:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<template-instance>
    <template-type>index</template-type>
</template-instance>
• 
Step 7: Go to the <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/surf/WEB-INF/
classes/alfresco/templates folder.

[ 282 ]
• 
Step 8: Create a new file with the name given previously in the template-
instance tag. Create the index.ftl file. Insert the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://
www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <head> 
      <title>${page.title}</title> 
   </head>
   <body>
      Home Page
   </body>
</html>
• 
Step 9: Test the application. You will find your home page is ready now. You 
should be able to test by hitting the URL of your web or app server. Navigate 
to the home page URL:  http://<server-name>:<port>/surf.
You will face a caching issue while using the Surf framework. In order to 
save server restart during development of an application, you can disable 
cache for the time period.
1.	 Edit the /WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/web-framework-
application-context.xml file.
2.	 Search for the word "updateDelay" and change the value to 0. There 
are two occurrences and properties to change:
<property name="updateDelay"><value>0</value></property>
3.	 Restart your application server for the change to take effect.
OR
By reloading the page, the changes will not be reflected. You have to 
explicitly clear the cache. Browse to the cache as follows:
http://<server-name>:<port>/surf/control/cache/invalidate

Use of a component in a page
The Surf framework binds the component to the specific region of a page and also 
specifies scope. Using this one can decide the position of the component to be placed 
in the page.
For instance, the footer should always be at the bottom of the page and the header 
should always be at the top of the page. As discussed earlier, each component has 
scopes to be defined. The Surf framework defines three categories of scopes:
• 
Global: Available across all pages. For example, the header and the footer 
template can have global access, which will be available on any page of the 
application. These are sections of the page that will not change from one page 
to the next.
• 
Page: Limited access to a page. The component will be available for the same 
page where it is defined.
• 
Template: Accessible to a few pages. The component is to be used for some 
pages but not for all.
Let's try to create a header component, the scope of which will be global. The naming 
convention for the component is very important. The name is defined as follows:
Scope.regionId.sourceId.xml
According to this, we are going to create global.header.xml. Here global is the 
scope, header is the region, and global is the sourceId. However, we have not 
used the third parameter, as it is a global scope component and therefore is used on 
all pages.
• 
Step 1: Let's create the global.header.xml file in the <install-
application>/tomcat/webapps/surf/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-
data/components folder and insert the following code:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
  <component>
      <scope>global</scope>
      <region-id>header</region-id>
      <source-id>global</source-id>
      <url>/component/common/header/header</url>
   </component>
The <url> tag is used to call web scripts. You will learn about web scripts in 
Chapter 10. Refer to the chapter to know more details about the web scripts. 
Web scripts are placed in the <install-application>/tomcat/webapps/
surf/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts folder.

• 
Step 2: Create the header folder inside the components/common folder. 
Create a new file header.get.desc.xml in the header folder. Insert the 
following code:
<webscript>
  <shortname>Global Header Component</shortname>
  <description>Header component used across the whole  
       application</description>
  <url>/component/common/header/header</url>
</webscript>
• 
Step 3: Create another new file, header.get.html.ftl, in the same location 
and insert the following code:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;  
  charset=UTF-8" />
<meta name="description" content="Small Corporation" />
<meta name="keywords" content="small, corporation" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${app.context}/css/

Our component is now ready to be placed in the page. In this template 
we are using stylesheets and images. You can create stylesheets in the 
<install-application>/tomcat/webapps/surf/css folder. For images 
you have to navigate to the <install-application>/tomcat/webapps/
surf/images folder.
Download the code from 
the Packt website.
• 
Step 4: Refresh the Web Script by entering the following URL:
 http://<server-name>:<port>/surf/service.
• 
Step 5: Insert the highlighted code in index.ftl (that you have created 
earlier within the <install-application>/tomcat/webapps/surf\WEB-
INF/classes/alfresco/templates folder within the <body> tag. Here we 
are using the region and scope defined in the component created earlier.
<@region id="header" scope="global" />
• 
Step 6: Test the component. You will find the header component is added in 
the home page. You should be able to test by entering the URL of your web 
or app server http://<server-name>:<port>/surf/.
Design page navigation
In the previous section, we learned about page creation and putting a component 
into a page. In this section, we shall learn about navigation from one page to  
another page.
For this, create one more page. Now we are going to link this page to the page we 
created earlier.

Step 9: Refresh the Web Script by entering the URL  
http://<server-name>:<port>/surf/service.
So far we have learned about the creation of a single-tier application. Now if we 
want to create a two-tier application, we shall create one more web script, which will 
be calling web scripts that are defined in Alfresco WCM.

Communicating with Web Content 
Management
Alfresco Surf works hand-in-hand with Alfresco Web Content Management and 
provides virtualized content retrieval, preview, and test support for User Sandboxes 
and web projects. Applications built with Alfresco Surf can be deployed from 
Alfresco Web Project spaces to production servers while taking full advantage of 
Alfresco WCM's Enterprise class features. These include:
• 
Safe editing of all aspects of Surf-powered sites: Snapshots allow your Surf 
site to roll backward and forward in time. Audit trails provide a rich log of 
changes made to the site.
• 
Integrated workflow for approval of all Surf components: These include 
pages, templates, components, chrome, and much more.
User Sandboxes provide freedom for experimentation and iteration in design. 
Change anything about your Surf site with the assurance that you can always 
discard changes or promote the bits you are happy with.
The following example is for integrating WCM web scripts with the Surf application. 
This Web Script is actually located on the remote Alfresco server and therefore we 
have to configure Surf to search the location for web scripts.
• 
Step 1: Go to the <install-alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/surf/WEB-INF/
classes/alfresco folder.
• 
Step 2: Modify the web-framework-config.xml file. Insert the following 
code before </web-framework>. The highlighted text cignex is the DNS name 
of the web project. This lets Surf bind to web application resources of the 
"cignex" web project.
  <resource-resolver>
    <id>webapp</id>
    <name>Alfresco Web Application Resource Resolver</name>
    <description>
      Resolves data access for web application assets
    </description>
    <class>
      org.alfresco.web.framework.resource.
AlfrescoWebProjectResourceResolver
    </class>
    <alias-uri>/files</alias-uri>
    <store-id>cignex</store-id>
  </resource-resolver>

• 
Step 3: Modify the file webscript-framework-config.xml. Uncomment the 
following code that is placed in the file. This configures the remote Alfresco 
repository as an endpoint.
  <endpoint>
    <id>alfresco-system</id>
    <name>Alfresco - System access</name>
    <description>System account access to Alfresco</description>
    <connector-id>alfresco</connector-id>
    <endpoint-url>http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s 
    </endpoint-url>
    <identity>declared</identity>
    <username>admin</username>
    <password>admin</password>
    <unsecure>true</unsecure>
  </endpoint>
The rest of the case study is covered in Chapter 10, in the Alfresco WCM –Surf-based 
Web application integration section.
Now we shall create one more web script that will call other web scripts that are 
stored in Alfresco WCM to fetch data.
• 
Step 1: Create a news folder inside the site-webscripts/components/
common folder. Create a new file news.get.desc.xml in the news folder. 
Insert the following code:
<webscript>
  <shortname>News</shortname>
  <description>Calls the remote Alfresco web script</description>
  <url>/component/common/news/news</url>
</webscript>
• 
Step 2: Create a template file, news.get.html.ftl, in the same location and 
insert the following code:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" 
/>
<meta name="description" content="Small Corporation" />
<meta name="keywords" content="small, corporation" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${app.context}/css/
style.css" media="screen" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${app.context}/css/

        ${n.Headline}
        <br>
      </#list>
     </td> 
  </tr>
</table>
• 
Step 3: Create a JavaScript file, news.get.js, in the same location and insert 
the following code:
{
  // get a connector to the Alfresco repository
  var connector = remote.connect("alfresco-system");
    var jsonFeed = connector.get("http://localhost:8080/alfresco/
service/org/cignex/news/getNewsHeadlines.json?storeId=cignex");
  var obj = eval('(' + jsonFeed + ')');  
  if (obj)
  {
    model.news = obj["newsItems"];
  }
}
Using YUI (Yahoo User Interface) library
YUI is a set of utilities and controls, written with JavaScript and CSS, for building 
richly interactive web applications. It is an open source JavaScript library using 
techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML, and AJAX. YUI consists of several 
CSS components and nearly three dozen JavaScript components, all of which are 
designed to empower the rapid creation of web applications that run in all of the 
major web browsers. It provides a rich set of widgets and utilities, such as animation, 
drag-and-drop, image loader, menu, paginator, uploader, and many others. Mainly, 
it has six components:
• 
YUI Core: It is a light set of tools for event management. It consists of 
Yahoo Global objects within which all of the YUI library code resides. It also 
contains an Event utility that provides developers with easy and safe access 
to browser events such as mouse clicks, key press, and so on.
• 
YUI Utilities: It provides various utilities like animation, data source, 
storage, SWF, JSON, image loader, drag-and-drop, and many more.
• 
YUI Widgets: It provides a variety of easy-to-use controls, such as Data 
Table, menu, paginator, progress bar, uploader, image cropper, and  
many more.

Alfresco Surf and Web Editor
[ 294 ]
• 
CSS Resources: It consists of CSS Reset (removes inconsistent styling of 
HTML elements provided by browsers), CSS fonts (standardized cross-
browser font families and size rendering), and CSS base (an optional CSS file 
that complements YUI's core CSS foundation).
• 
Development tools: It contains Logger Control (provides a quick and easy 
way to write log messages to an onscreen console), Profiler (allows you to 
specify exactly the parts of your application to the profile), ProfilerViewer 
control (used in combination with Profiler to provide rich visualizations of 
your profiling data), and YUI test utility (testing framework for browser-
based JavaScript solutions).
• 
Build Tool: YUI Compressor is a build-process component written in Java 
that minifies your JavaScript and CSS. It is a JavaScript and CSS minifier 
designed to be 100 percent safe and yield a higher compression ratio than 
most other tools.
As we discussed earlier, we have a set of predefined controls that we can use by 
instantiating an object and calling a set of methods on them.
For instance, use the horizontal menu plugin provided by the YUI library and 
observe how easy it is to make a rich menu.
Modify the file header.get.html.ftl located at site-webscripts/components/
common/header. Insert the downloaded code from the Packt website. You will notice 
a change in the menu style.
Download the code samples 
from the Packt website.

Alfresco Web Editor
Alfresco Web Editor is an application developed using the Spring Surf platform. 
It provides in-context editing capabilities for Alfresco repository content. Because 
of the in-context editing capability of the Web Editor, it's very easy for any non-
technical person to edit Alfresco content directly from the web page. It supports 
Presentation editing for Surf-based websites.
Alfresco Web Editor is a Surf application incorporating the Alfresco Form Engine. It 
uses the Form Service default template.
Alfresco Web Editor is packaged as a standalone WAR file (awe.war). Hence you can 
deploy it as a standalone application on the same server where Alfresco is running or 
also can deploy it as a part of any Surf Application remote to the Alfresco server.
Deploying and using Alfresco Web Editor
First you need to download the Alfresco Web Editor. A file alfresco-enterprise-
webeditor-3.3.zip will consist of the awe.war file and other required files. To 
deploy AWE, follow the steps mentioned below:
1.	 Browse to https://network.alfresco.com and download the alfresco-
enterprise-webeditor-3.3.zip file. Refer to the Alfresco wiki to 
download the community version: http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/
Alfresco_Community_Edition_3.3.
www.it-ebooks.info

Alfresco Surf and Web Editor
[ 296 ]
2.	 Stop your Alfresco server if it's already running.
3.	 Deploy the awe.war file (which is there in the downloaded ZIP file) into the 
same application server where Alfresco is running.
4.	 Restart your Alfresco server.
Once you start the Alfresco server, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/
awe. You will see the login page; provide the same username and password you are 
using for Alfresco (admin/admin).
The first page you will see will be the metadata page; here you can pass any Alfresco 
content noderef as itemId parameter and can update the metadata of that content as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
[ 297 ]
Deploying Web Editor to a Spring Surf 
Application
As mentioned in the introduction of the Alfresco Web Editor, we can also deploy  
the Web Editor to any Surf Application, which is remote to the Alfresco server. 
In this section, we will discuss how we can deploy and what are the extra 
configurations we need to do for using it in a Surf-based application. The Alfresco 
Web Editor distribution contains all of the required files for configuring it for the  
Surf-based application.
1.	 Copy the following files to the WEB-INF/lib directory:
°°
yui-2.7.0.jar
°°
spring-webeditor-1.0.0.CI-SNAPSHOT.jar
°°
alfresco-forms-client-3.3.jar
°°
alfresco-webeditor-plugin-3.3.jar
2.	 Configuring the Tag Library:
Alfresco Web Editor provides tag library. If you intend to use the tags 
provided in this library, you need to copy the alfresco-webeditor-
taglib-3.3.jar file in the WEB-INF/lib folder.
This tag library mainly includes three tags: startTemplate, markContent, 
and endTemplate. We will discuss about these tags later in this chapter.
3.	 Configuring the Servlet Filter:
If you are using the previously mentioned tags, startTemplate, 
markContent, and endTemplate will only render the output if you have 
configured the Web Editor filter in web.xml as follows:
<filter>
<filter-name>Alfresco Web Editor Filter</filter-name>
<description>Enables support for the Alfresco Web Editor</
description>
<filter-class>org.alfresco.web.awe.filter.WebEditorFilter</
filterclass>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>Alfresco Web Editor Filter</filter-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

You can also set the following two optional parameters to control the 
contextPath when the URLs to the Web Editor are generated and for the 
debug mode:
<init-param>
<param-name>contextPath</param-name>
<param-value>/quickstart</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
<param-name>debug</param-name>
<param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>
4.	 Configuring Web Editor Forms:
The Alfresco Web Editor uses Forms to edit the content and the metadata. 
By default, it displays the title, description, and content fields. An alternative 
form can be used by providing a markContent tag with the formId attribute.
The node type is presumed to be cm:content. If you have custom  
types or wish to specify other properties, you can use the form's 
configuration techniques.
Alfresco Web Editor tag library
The Alfresco Web Editor tag library consists of three tags: StartTemplate, 
markContent, and endTemplate.
• 
startTemplate tag
Purpose:
This tag bootstraps the Web Editor Framework using a script element that 
executes a Web Script. Place this tag in the head section of the page.
Attributes:
toolbarLocation
This attribute specifies the location of the toolbar.
<awe:startTemplate toolbarLocation="top" /> specifies the location as 
top in the window for the toolbar.
The possible values are: top, left, and right. This is an optional attribute; 
the default is top.

Chapter 9
[ 299 ]
• 
markContent tag
Purpose:
This tag indicates the editable area on the page. This renders an Edit icon; 
when clicked, it displays a form to edit the content or metadata or both.
Attributes:
id: This attribute specifies the noderef of the Alfresco node. This is a 
mandatory attribute.
title: This attribute specifies a title for the marked editable area. The same 
title will be used in quick edit drop–down, form edit pop-up dialog, and  
so on.
This is a mandatory attribute.
formId: This attribute specifies which form will be used when the marked 
area is edited. This is an optional attribute.
nestedMarker: This attribute defines whether the editable area is nested 
within another HTML tag that represents the content being edited. If set 
to "true" the whole parent element is highlighted when the area is selected 
in the quick edit drop-down menu. If set to "false", only the edit icon is 
highlighted.
• 
endTemplate tag
Purpose:
This tag initializes the Web Editor with details of all of the marked content 
areas on the page. It also renders a script element that executes the WEF 
resources web script, which starts the process of downloading all of the 
assets required to render and display the toolbar and all configured plugins. 
Place this tag just before the closing body element
Attributes:
This tag doesn't have any attribute.
Sample Web Application using Alfresco Web 
Editor
When you download the Web Editor distribution, you will find one sample 
application, customer.war. This is a simple JSP-based application, which uses the 
tag library provided by AWE.
In this application, we will use the already created content on our custom JSP and 
will allow users to have an in-context editing facility for that content.

For example, you can create content in Alfresco. Go to Company Home and 
a specific space where you want to create the content. Use the Add content 
functionality to upload any file. Here in this example, I have uploaded one HTML 
file called Cignex_Merge_News.html to the Alfresco repository.
In the noderefs.jsp file located at customer/includes, provide the noderef of 
the previously created content from the Alfresco Repository as shown next (it is the 
modified content of noderefs.jsp):
<%
String mainTextNodeRef = "workspace://SpacesStore/3b12b9a8-8f9f-414d-
8a9d-40047822d1cf";
%>
Note that workspace://SpacesStore/3b12b9a8-8f9f-414d-
8a9d-40047822d1cf is the noderef of Alfresco content Cignex_
Merge_News.html. To find the nodeRef of your content, go to the 
View Details page of the content and click on Alfresco Node Reference.
Also update the body.jsp located at customer/includes accordingly.
Once you specify the noderefs as earlier and click on http://localhost:8080/
customer, you can see the screen shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
[ 301 ]
This application has custom tags to display the property and content of the  
specified noderef.
To display any property of the noderef, use a property tag like:
<customer:property nodeRef="<%=mainTextNodeRef%>" 
property="cm:description" />
To display the content of the noderef, use a content tag like:
<customer:content nodeRef="<%=mainTextNodeRef%>" />
As discussed earlier, the startTemplate tag will have a toolbarLocation 
attribute that specifies the location of the toolbar (the default is "top"). The following 
screenshot shows the toolbar on the page:
You can directly click on the link available in the drop-down here in the toolbar. 
Another option is the Edit icon that is also available with the content. The following 
screenshot shows how you can use the in-context editing feature to edit the content.

When you click on the Edit icon, it will open the window in which you can edit 
the title, description, or content. This window is using Alfresco's form service. You 
can specify which form ID you want to use for in-context editing. As described in 
the earlier section, with the markContent tag, you can specify the formId attribute, 
which specifies the form to use for in-context editing. For example:
<awe:markContent id="<%=<<NODEREF>>%>" formId="description" 
title="Edit News Description" nestedMarker="true" />

Web Editor Framework
Web Editor Framework consists of core components and UI widgets. The framework 
allows you to easily develop and add the plugin. This is achievable because of the 
nature of the framework, which is supplied by the support of hooks around core 
methods. The web editor is an event-driven framework. Every core method of a 
plugin fires a before and an after event for that method.

Core WEF Components
The Core WEF Components are as follows:
• 
WEF: The WEF object is responsible for bootstrapping the Web Editor 
framework onto the page.
• 
Loader: The loader is responsible for setting up resources for modules (and 
any of their dependencies) to be loaded by the browser.
• 
ConfigRegistry: The ConfigRegistry object is responsible for maintaining a 
registry of configuration objects for a specified plugin.
• 
PluginRegistry: The PluginRegistry maintains a registry of plugins.
• 
Base: The WEF.Base is the core class that all WEF components are based on.
• 
Plugin: The Plugin component builds on Base and every plugin is expected 
to be the one that extends Plugin or one of its subclasses.
• 
Widget: A widget is a UI element that can be interacted with. A dialog is a 
good example of a widget.
• 
App: An App is just a plugin and adds no additional methods of its own.
Core WEF Widgets
The Core WEF Widgets are as follows:
• 
Ribbon: The Ribbon component is responsible for displaying the ribbon at the 
top of the page and also for managing and/or registered toolbars and plugins.
• 
Toolbar: The Toolbar component is a simple component that manages a 
collection of buttons.
• 
Tabbed Toolbar: The Tabbed Toolbar manages a collection of toolbars that 
are rendered in different tabs.

Integrating WCM Using Web 
Scripts
In this chapter, we will learn about web scripts and integration of WCM with 
external systems using web scripts. In previous chapters, you got an idea about why 
to use WCM, how to create web projects, and how to produce content in Alfresco 
WCM along with deployments to a different server. So far we discussed how we use 
Alfresco as a content production and delivery system and for serving the content. 
You may have your own application and may want to use Alfresco purely for 
web content management, which will just produce the content in Alfresco. But the 
presentation part of the application will not be handled by Alfresco. Here you can 
have your frontend application in any technology and you can use Alfresco WCM as 
the backend, which will serve the content to your application. Web script's RESTful 
service is one of the most easily available and widely used solutions to integrate the 
Alfresco WCM with any external system or application.
By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about:
• 
REST architecture
• 
Web script framework in Alfresco
• 
Components of web scripts
• 
WCM-specific JavaScript and template APIs
• 
Implementing web scripts in Alfresco
•

Concepts of WCM web scripts
In this section, you will get an overview of web scripts in WCM. We will talk about 
the REST architecture and web script framework in Alfresco. We will also talk about 
the new features introduced for web scripts in Alfresco 3. At the end of this section, 
you will have a very good idea about the architectural benefits of using RESTful web 
services, how it helps in providing solutions with the Alfresco WCM, and also how 
easy it is to integrate WCM with an external system.
Overview of REST architecture
In this section, we will discuss about the REST architecture and RESTful web 
services. You will also get an idea about how RESTful web services are different than 
our traditional SOAP-based web services and the advantages of using this approach 
over a traditional SOAP-based approach.
What is REST
REST (Representational State Transfer) is used to describe a Web Oriented 
Architecture rather than a Service-Oriented Architecture. It is an architectural  
style following the principles referred to as "RESTful". RESTful web services are 
resource-oriented services. You can identify and locate resources by a Uniform 
Resource Identifier (URI). By making everything URL (URI)-based, you can access 
everything via that URL and use standard web commands such as Get and Post to 
access and update those things, something we call resources.
REST's main principles
• 
Resource-oriented states and functionalities that are abstracted into resources
• 
Unique way of identifying resources
• 
The idea of how operations on these resources are defined in terms of a 
single protocol for interacting with resources
• 
A protocol that is client-server, stateless, cacheable, and layered
• 
REST-oriented system design leads to systems that are open, scalable, 
extensible, and easy to understand

This URL-based update of information contrasts with a very Remote Procedure Call-
like interface of SOAP. The following points give an idea about how RESTful web 
services differ from SOAP-based web services:
• 
Design approach: REST focuses on resources, whereas web services focus on 
messages, which are operations. 
• 
Less dependencies as there is no SOAP required.
• 
Cacheable representation leads to improved response time and  
reduced server load.
• 
No need for a separate resource directory due to the use of hyperlinks  
in representations.
• 
Improves server scalability by reducing the need to maintain session state. 
This means that different servers can be used to handle different requests  
in a session.
Alfresco web scripts overview
Alfresco provides a web script framework based on REST architecture, which was 
described in the earlier section. RESTful web scripts provide a very suitable and 
flexible solution to integrate Alfresco with any other application, and is usually the 
best solution out of all of the available options. With the help of web scripts, you 
can easily access the Alfresco repository and perform operations such as content 
searching, retrieval, manipulation, and so on with the help of services available in 
Alfresco, even from outside Alfresco.
What is a web script
A REST web script is simply a service bound to a URI and based on HTTP. So the 
technology that the external application is implemented on is irrelevant, that is, they 
are cross platform and cross language. You are not locked into any programming 
language or development environment.
The web script framework lets you roll your own APIs, thereby allowing you to fine-
tune the remote APIs that you expose to the external application. REST provides a 
convenient bridge between any native application and the content management. This 
allows you to place controls on your enterprise content to manage it and at the same 
time provide uniform access for a wide variety of client applications and services, 
such as browser, portal, search engine, or custom application.

[ 308 ]
Why to use web scripts
The advantages of using a web script for integrating external applications with 
Alfresco WCM are:
• 
Build custom URI-identified and HTTP-accessible content management  
web services
• 
Turn your Alfresco repository into a content management-powered  
HTTP server
• 
Instead of having a single, monolithic system responsible for all aspects of 
a content-centric web application, this provides a design of loosely coupled 
sub-systems that are being integrated to create more agile solutions
• 
This approach allows your content management system (Alfresco WCM) to 
have a flexible and lightweight interface
• 
Provides the flexibility of not being locked into a presentation approach 
based on the content repository
• 
Uses lightweight scripting technologies such as JavaScript and FreeMarker
Alfresco web script framework
Alfresco's web script framework follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, 
which makes a developer's life easy. The Model-View-Controller design pattern 
decouples data access, business logic, and data presentation. By applying the MVC 
pattern, you can separate core business model functionality from the presentation 
and control logic that uses this functionality. Such separation allows multiple views 
to share the same enterprise data model, which makes supporting multiple clients 
easier to implement, test, and maintain.

As shown in the previous figure, the Controller here is the server-side JavaScript. 
It can also be JavaBeans or a combination of both. The request first comes to the 
REST Dispatcher, and Web script Run Time forwards this to the Controller, which 
is responsible for processing the request. It performs the required business logic 
with the help of Alfresco core services and populates the model with data, and then 
forwards the request to the View. A View is one or more FreeMarker templates and 
is responsible for generating the response in the proper format (XML, HTML, JSON, 
and so on) as a presentation layer. Finally, the Web script Run time will send the 
response back to the client.
• 
Controller: JavaScript/JavaBeans
• 
View: One or more FreeMarker templates
• 
Model: Data structure, used to pass data between View and Controller
What's new in Alfresco 3 web scripts
Alfresco has introduced web scripts framework in older versions such as 2.1. With 
new releases of Alfresco, efforts are being made to enhance the capabilities of web 
scripts. Following are some of the enhancements for web scripts available from 
Alfresco 3 onwards:
• 
Standalone component
With this new Alfresco version 3, the web script architecture is refactored in 
such a way that you need not use the Alfresco repository server to host, but 
you can host it in any environment and even in tiers. This will allow web 
scripts to be used in a presentation layer to render UI. For example, the Alfresco 
Surf platform hosts the web script framework for reusable UI components.
• 
URI templates comply with JSR-311 (JAX-RS)
A URI template is simply a URI containing tokens that may be substituted 
with actual values. From Alfresco 3.0, this template syntax complies with the 
template syntax of JSR-311 (JAX-RS).
• 
Run as user
You can use the runas attribute with authentication in the description 
document for a web script. This will allow declaring an alternative username 
to run the web script, as this is valid for class path-stored web scripts only.
• 
Ability to customize web scripts with web script-specific configuration
Configuration is accessed via the config root object, which is available 
during both controller script and template execution. So, with the help of 
this, you can have web script-specific configuration, which can then be used 
in a controller or rendering template.

[ 310 ]
• 
Per web script message bundle
To localize the web script response, with Alfresco 3.0 and later, you can have 
a message bundle for each web script.
• 
Improved form processing
When posting a request of mime type multipart/form-data, formdata 
is available to the controller script as a root object. This root object allows a 
web script to read all fields. These multi-part form fields are also mapped to 
args/argsM.
• 
Access to request headers
With this version, Alfresco provides one more JavaScript root object named 
headers, which is an associative array of all request headers. In this way, you 
can access the request header as well from the web script controller script.
• 
Request body processing
The root object requestbody, which represents the content of a request body, 
is available with Alfresco 3.
• 
Content negotiation
You can have a negotiate element in a description document, which 
associates an Accept header mime type to a specific web script format of 
response; the value (mandatory) specifies the format while the accept 
attribute (mandatory) specifies the mime type. You can have zero or more 
negotiation elements, but to enable content negotiation you need the 
definition of at least one negotiate element.
• 
Declarative and programmatic cache control
You can have a cache element specified in the description document 
(declarative) for caching and set some child elements to configure the cache. 
Also, you can have a cache root object available in the controller, which 
helps to control the cache runtime (programmatic).
You can override some definition time controls and also set expiry criteria 
with this root level object cache.
• 
Web script families
If you want to categorize similar or related web scripts in groups, you can 
configure a family element in the description document.
The family tag may be repeated if the script belongs to more than one family.
• 
Specialized kinds of web scripts
A web script "kind" allows a Java-backed implementation to be named, 
and for any web script description document to state if it wants to use that 
implementation instead of the out-of-the-box one provided by Alfresco.

Using web scripts with Alfresco WCM
As described in Chapter 1, A Publishing Style Web CMS, Alfresco WCM is used for 
content production and content delivery. Alfresco supports two main models for 
content delivery—static and dynamic. With the dynamic delivery model, content 
is served from Alfresco; however, the rendering part will not be handled by it, but 
by some other application. This provides flexibility in deciding what content to 
display and how it will be displayed on a page. Basically, a web script will act as 
a communication channel to fetch the content, which is being stored in Alfresco. 
With the dynamic content delivery model, content will be published to an Alfresco 
Runtime (as shown in the following figure) with ASR deployment, thereby making 
the content available for dynamic queries by basically any web technology (J2EE, 
PHP, Python, .NET, Ajax, Flash, Cold Fusion, and so on). Here the web script is a 
remote API used to query and retrieve the content from Alfresco Runtime:

Integrating WCM Using Web Scripts
[ 312 ]
In this way, you can use Alfresco purely for web content management, which will 
be responsible for just producing the content, and then any application outside 
Alfresco will be responsible for the actual page composition. Hence, you will have 
the flexibility to separate content production and content rendering/presentation. 
This allows us to easily integrate Alfresco with any other application. Later in this 
chapter, we will see integration with Liferay and Drupal, which will give you an 
overview of how we can use Alfresco as a content production environment. Then we 
will use that content in any application outside Alfresco.
Implementing web scripts for WCM
Now after getting a good overview of web scripts, REST architecture, and the 
Alfresco web script framework, it's time to implement the web script for Alfresco 
WCM. In this section, we will discuss how to create a web script and the required 
components of web scripts in detail.
Components of web scripts
Before creating any web script, it is necessary to know about the different 
components of a web script. So now we are going to talk about them.
Description document
Description document is the entry point and required component for a web script. 
Here you have to specify the URI of a web script, which will initiate that web 
script. Along with the URI of the web script, a description document describes the 
short name, description, authentication, and transactional details. The description 
document provides Alfresco with all of the necessary information to bind the web 
script to one or more URLs.
Controller script
Controller script is generally used if you want to perform some business logic such 
as querying the database and fetching some content or updating the repository with 
some data or content. You can generate a data model within the controller, which 
will be used by one or more response templates. This is an optional component of a 
web script.

Chapter 10
[ 313 ]
One or more response templates
Response template is basically the view part of a web script MVC framework, which 
is responsible for rendering the output in the proper format. You can specify more 
than one response format in the description document and create those templates 
for different formats. You can use the model generated by the controller in response 
templates. This is a mandatory component of a web script. You should have at least 
one response template for each web script.
Configuration document
There are different kinds of configurations defined in the XML document, which can 
be accessed via the config root object. This config object is available during both 
controller script and response template. This is an optional component of a web script.
Locale message bundle
From Alfresco version 3, a web script supports the localization of responses of  
a script. Each web script can have separate message bundles to store  
locale-specific messages.
Creating a description document
As stated earlier, a description document is the entry point for a web script, which 
initiates the web script. This is the mandatory component for a web script. You need 
to follow the naming convention for a web script description document, which is  
as follows:
<serviceId>.<httpMethod>.desc.xml
where serviceId is the web script ID and httpMethod can be GET, POST, PUT,  
or DELETE.
For example, if we have a web script that is responsible for getting the news 
headlines, we can have the filename as getNewsHeadline.get.desc.xml.
The content of this description document can be:
<webscript>
  <shortname>Listing Of News Headlines</shortname>
  <description>Listing Of News Headlines for Cignex home page thru 
Webscript</description>
  <url>/org/cignex/news/getNewsHeadlines.xml?storeId={storeId}</url>
  <authentication>user</authentication>
</webscript>

[ 314 ]
Basic elements of description document
• 
shortname: Human readable name for the web script and a  
mandatory element.
• 
description: Documentation for the web script. This is an optional element.
• 
url: A URI template to which the web script is bound. There can be one or 
more variants of the URI template for different formats.
• 
format: Decides how the required response type is stated with the URI. This 
is an optional element. Possible values (optional) are as follows:
°°
argument: Describes the required response type, which can 
be declared via the format URI argument. For example, /
news?format=json.
°°
extension: Specifies that the required response type can be declared 
via the URI extension. For example, /news.json.
°°
any: Specifies that either of the previous two is supported.
If not specified, the default value for format is any. And if the URI doesn't 
contain any response type, a default content type is taken from the default 
attribute of the format element, which is optional. And, if not specified there 
as well, the default format is html.
• 
authentication: The required level of authentication. This element is 
optional. If not specified, the default authentication is none. Valid values  
are as follows:
°°
none: Specifies that no authentication is required at all
°°
guest: Specifies that at least guest authentication is required
°°
user: Specifies that at least named user authentication is required
°°
admin: Specifies that at least a named admin authentication  
is required
The optional runas attribute can be used to declare an alternative username 
to run the web script as. This is valid for classpath-stored web scripts only.
Advanced configuration for a description document
Following are the elements used for advanced configuration of a description 
document. All of them are optional elements:
• 
transaction: Specifies the required level of transaction. This is an optional 
element. The default value is none. The valid values are:
°°
none: Specifies that no transaction is required at all

Chapter 10
[ 315 ]
°°
required: Specifies that a transaction is required and will inherit an 
existing transaction, if any is open
°°
requiresnew: Specifies that a new transaction is required; this will 
not inherit an existing transaction, if any is open
• 
family: Used to specify a tag for categorizing similar or related web scripts. 
You can have more than one family tag if this script belongs to more than 
one family.
• 
cache: Specifies the required level of caching. Available child elements are:
°°
never: Specifies whether caching should be applied at all; default 
option is true. Valid values are:
• 
true: Specifies that the web script response should never  
be cached
• 
false: Specifies that the web script response may be cached
If never is not specified, the default is true.
°°
public: Specifies whether authenticated responses should be cached 
in a public cache; default is true. If public is not specified, then the 
default is false. Valid options for the public element are:
• 
true: Specifies that the web script authenticated response 
may be cached in a public cache
• 
false: Specifies that the web script authenticated response 
may not be cached in a public cache
°°
mustrevalidate: Specifies whether a cache must revalidate its 
version of the web script response in order to ensure freshness. The 
default value for this is true. Available valid values are:
• 
true: Specifies that validation must occur
• 
false: Specifies that validation may occur
• 
negotiate (zero or more): Associates an Accept header MIME type to  
a specific web script format of response; the value (mandatory) specifies  
the format and the mandatory accept attribute specifies the MIME type  
when content negotiation is enabled with the definition of at least one 
negotiate element.
• 
kind: An attribute discriminator for overriding the kind of web script. See 
the list of available web script kinds. An attribute kind allows a Java-backed 
implementation to be named, and for any web script description document 
to state, it wants to use that implementation instead of the out-of-the-box one 
provided by Alfresco.

Integrating WCM Using Web Scripts
[ 316 ]
• 
lifecycle: An attribute for describing the lifecycle of the web script. Web 
scripts typically start out in some sort of a draft state, are promoted to full 
production use, and are then retired at the end of their life. The possible 
values for this attribute are as follows:
°°
none: States this web script is not part of a lifecycle.
°°
sample: Indicates this web script is a sample and is not intended for 
production use.
°°
draft: Indicates this method may be incomplete, experimental, or 
still subject to change.
°°
public_api: Specifies this method is part of the Alfresco public API 
and should be stable and well tested.
°°
draft_public_api: Specifies this method is intended to eventually 
become part of the public API, but is incomplete or still subject  
to change.
°°
deprecated: States this method should be avoided. It may be 
removed in future versions of Alfresco.
°°
internal: Indicates this script is for Alfresco use only. This script 
should not be relied upon between versions.
Response templates (URI templates)
According to the MVC architecture of a web script, a template acts as the role of 
view, which is responsible for rendering the web script output. You can have more 
than one template file for different response types. However, at least one template 
is a mandatory component for any web script. You need to follow the naming 
convention for a web script response template, which is as follows:
<serviceId>.<httpMethod>.<format>.ftl
where serviceId is the web script ID and httpMethod can be GET, POST, PUT, or 
DELETE. format specifies the response type format.
For example, if we have a web script that is responsible for getting the news headlines 
in the XML format, we can have the filename as getNewsHeadline.get.xml.ftl.

[ 317 ]
Response type formats
Any web script can have one or more response types. By default, formats supported 
by Alfresco for response type are as follows:
• 
html: text/html
• 
text: text/plain
• 
xml: text/xml
• 
atom: application/atom+xml
• 
atomentry: application/atom+xml;type=entry
• 
atomfeed: application/atom+xml;type=feed
• 
rss: application/rss+xml
• 
json: application/json
• 
opensearchdescription: application/opensearchdescription+xml
• 
mediawiki: text/plain (Media Wiki markup)
• 
portlet: text/html
• 
fbml: text/html
• 
php: text/html 
• 
js: text/javascript
• 
calendar: text/calendar
There are two ways to specify the format of the response type:
• 
As format argument in the web script URL. For example, http://<host>:<p
ort>/<contextPath>/<servicePath>/getNewsHeadline?format=xml.
• 
As a part of web script URL directly. For example,  http://<host>:<port>/
<contextPath>/<servicePath>/getNewsHeadline.xml.
This specifies that the list of formats is the out-of-the-box supported format types by 
Alfresco. If you want to introduce a new format, configure the following Spring Bean 
declaring the format map with your new format:
<bean parent="webscripts.formatmap">
  <property name="formats">
    <props>
      <prop key="wav">audio/x-mpeg-3 </prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>

Root objects of FreeMarker
Alfresco provides a default model provided by the JSF template component and 
template servlet, which provides a number of common root objects useful for most 
FreeMarker templates. The list of these root objects which you can use for a web 
script template is as follows:
• 
companyhome: The company home template node. This is available only  
if authenticated.
• 
userhome: Current user's home space template node. This is available  
only if authenticated.
• 
person: Current user's person object template node. This is available only if 
authenticated.
• 
args: A map of any URL parameters passed via the Template  
Content Servlet.
• 
session: Session-related information. It provides a single-value session.
ticket for the current authentication ticket.
• 
classification: Read access to classifications and root categories.
• 
url: An object providing access to the URL or parts of the URL that triggered 
the web script.
• 
workflow: Read access to information on workflow objects and the currently 
executing workflows for a user.
• 
avm: Root-level object for a WCM web project. Using this API, it is possible to 
build templates that display content from files in the staging area or sandbox 
of a web project-based website.
• 
argsM: An associative array of any URL parameters where each key is a 
parameter name and each value is an array containing the parameter values, 
even if only one is supplied.
• 
guest: A Boolean indicating whether the web script executes as "Guest".
• 
date: A date representing the date and time of the web script request.
• 
server: An associative array of metadata properties that describe the hosting 
Alfresco server.
• 
roothome: The repository root node.
• 
webscript: An associative array of metadata properties that describe this 
web script.

Apart from all of these root objects, the template also has access to root objects 
created by the execution script, if any script has been associated with the web script. 
You can also have JavaBeans associated with the web script, and you can create 
objects there as well, which will be accessed by this FreeMarker template for the  
web script.
FreeMarker methods for the AVM 
repository
Each of these root objects has different APIs. For more detail on this you can refer 
Alfresco wiki's Template Guide page at http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/
Template_Guide and see some examples at http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/
FreeMarker_Template_Cookbook. In this section, we will talk about the FreeMarker 
APIs available for the AVM repository.
AVM API
As stated earlier, avm is the root object for FreeMarker templates; with this root 
object, you can access the AVM repository. The available APIs for an AVM root node 
are as follows:
• 
stores: This returns all store objects in the AVM repository
• 
lookupStore(storeid): This returns the store object for the specified  
store ID
• 
lookupStoreRoot(storeid): This returns the root node for the specified 
store ID
• 
lookupNode(path): This returns a single AVM node based on the given full 
path including store to the node

Response status
Web script response is used to inform the status to the client. It uses HTTP response 
status code for the following scenarios:
• 
To inform the client about the cause of an error
• 
To inform the client about the occurrence of an event
• 
To instruct a client to perform a follow-up request
• 
To inform a client about the success of a web script
To set this status code, the status root object is available in the web script. And if you 
are using a Java-backed web script, then overload the API with status as one of the 
parameters. In the script, you can use the status code as follows:
status.code = 400;
status.message = "Required parameter's value has not been provided.";
status.redirect = true;
When you redirect like this, it will render the custom response template for the 
specified code. Searching of corresponding status templates will be performed in the 
following order:
• 
Web script-specific template named <scriptid>.<method>.<format>. 
<code>.ftl
• 
Web script-specific template named <scriptid>.<method>.<format>.
status.ftl
• 
Package-level template named <format>.<code>.ftl
• 
Package-level template named <format>.status.ftl
• 
Default template named <code>.ftl

Web script controller
In this section, we will discuss about the web script controller. Controller is an 
optional attribute of any web script. If you don't need it, you can omit this section.

[ 322 ]
Objectives of a controller
This is an optional component of a web script, but generally used when you want 
to access the repository and perform certain operations. Similar to the role of a 
controller in the MVC architecture, here also the main objective of the controller is to 
dictate what to do behind the scenes and what to display in the view. The controller 
builds a data model that is passed to the FreeMarker response templates and 
rendered. Web scripts in Alfresco support two types of controllers:
• 
JavaScript controller
• 
Java-backed controller
In the following sections, we will talk about these both in detail.
JavaScript controller
A controller is used in order to perform some business logic, and one of the available 
controllers is JavaScript, which is also known as execution script. You need to follow 
the naming convention for a web script execution script, which is:
<serviceId>.<httpMethod>.js
where serviceId is the web script ID and httpMethod can be GET, POST, PUT,  
or DELETE.
For example, if we have a web script that is responsible for getting the news, we can 
have the filename as getNewsHeadline.get.js.
Root objects for an execution script
Alfresco provides a set of default root objects also known as Script Node objects that 
wrap the common Alfresco repository concepts such as nodes, aspects, associations, 
and properties.
The list of these root objects, which you can use for an execution script, is as follows:
• 
companyhome: The company home template node. This is available only  
if authenticated.
• 
userhome: Current user's home space template node. This is available only  
if authenticated.
• 
person: Current user's person object template node. This is available only  
if authenticated.
• 
args: An associative array of any URL parameters.

[ 323 ]
• 
search: The host object providing access to Lucene Search.
• 
people: The host object providing access to Alfresco people and groups.
• 
actions: The host object providing invocation of registered Alfresco actions.
• 
logger: The host object providing access to console logging facilities for 
debugging of scripts.
• 
session: Session-related information such as the current authentication ticket.
• 
classification: Access to the root elements of the classification API.
• 
utils: Access to a library of useful helper functions not provided as part of 
the generic JavaScript.
• 
avm: Access to WCM objects such as avm stores and web projects.
• 
webprojects: The root of the WCM JavaScript API. It provides access to web 
projects, sandboxes, WCM assets, and WCM project membership.
• 
crossrepository: Cross repository copy support. This enables copying of 
nodes between document management spaces and WCM spaces.
• 
argsM: An associative array of any URL parameters.
• 
url: Provides access to the URL (or parts of the URL) that triggered the  
web script.
• 
formdata: Provides access to multi-part/formdata requests allowing the 
upload of files via web scripts.
• 
model: An empty associative array that may be populated by the JavaScript. 
Values placed into this array are available as root objects in web script 
response templates.
• 
roothome: The repository root node.
• 
guest: A Boolean indicating whether the web script executes as "Guest".
• 
server: An associative array of metadata properties describing the 
repository server hosting the web script.
JavaScript methods for the AVM 
repository
Each of these root objects has different APIs. For more details on this, you can refer to 
the Alfresco wiki's JavaScript API page at http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/3.2_
JavaScript_API and see some examples at http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/
JavaScript_API_Cookbook. In the next section, we will talk about FreeMarker APIs 
that are available for the AVM repository.

[ 324 ]
AVM API
avm is the root object for JavaScript APIs, and with this root object you can access the 
AVM repository. The available APIs for the avm root node are as follows:
• 
stores: This returns all store objects in the AVM repository
• 
lookupStore(storeid): This returns the store object for the specified  
store ID
• 
lookupStoreRoot(storeid): This returns the root node for the specified 
store ID
• 
lookupNode(path): This returns a single AVM node based on the given full 
path, including store to the node
• 
webappsFolderPath(storeid): This returns the root path to the AVM 
webapps folder for the specified store ID
AVM store API
When you use any of the previous mentioned AVM API, you will get the object of 
the AVM store. This store object can have the APIs described next:
• 
id: This returns the internal ID of the store
• 
name: This returns the name of the store
• 
creator: This returns the user who has created this store
• 
createdDate: This returns the date on which the store was created
• 
lookupRoot: This returns the root node for the store
• 
lookupNode(path): This returns the node for the specified path relative to 
the AVM webapps root folder for the store
• 
luceneSearch(query): This executes a search against the store and returns 
an array of AVM nodes as the result
AVM node API
• 
version: Returns node's version. Generally it will be –1 (Head revision).
• 
path: Returns fully qualified AVM path to the node.
• 
parentPath: Returns fully qualified AVM path to the parent of the node.
• 
isDirectory: Returns true if this node is a directory.
• 
isFile: Returns true if this node is a file.
• 
isLocked: Returns true if this node is currently locked.

[ 325 ]
• 
isLockOwner: Returns true if this node is locked by the current user.
• 
hasLockAccess: Returns true if this user has the permission to perform 
operations on the node when locked. This is true if the item is either 
unlocked, locked by the current user, or locked and the current user has the 
Content Manager role in the associated web project.
• 
rename(name): This renames the node. In AVM you cannot change the 
cm:name property directly to change the name.
Java-backed controller
If the script and template are not sufficient enough to achieve the required 
functionality, you can have a Java Bean where you will have full control over the 
Alfresco Repository and also the Java API. With Web script, you can bind a Java 
Bean as a Spring Bean in Alfresco. When you have a Java bean, you can also have  
a combination of web Java script with it. The sequence of execution will be first  
Java script will be executed first and then Java bean if you have both used for any 
web script.
How to declare a Java Bean
To bind a Java Bean as a Spring Bean for any web script, you need to make a bean 
entry in the web-script-custom-context.xml file in the /WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/extension folder. Also, you have to follow a proper naming convention 
for that bean ID, which will be:
id="webscript.<packageId>.<serviceId>.<httpMethod>"
where packageId is the package in which the web script descriptor file is located, 
serviceId is the web script ID, and httpMethod can be GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.
Also, the parent of this bean should be webscript while configuring this:
<bean id="webscript.org.cignex.news.getNewsHeadline.get"
      class="com.cignex.web.scripts.bean.news.GetNewsHeadline"
      parent="webscript" />
Creating a Java Bean class
When creating a Java Bean class, GetNewsHeadline, as in the previous section, this 
class must implement the org.alfresco.web.scripts.WebScript interface, which 
has the method:
public void execute(WebScriptRequest req, WebScriptResponse res)

Integrating WCM Using Web Scripts
[ 326 ]
You need to implement this method in your Java Bean class. There are two helper 
classes provided to simplify the development of a Java-backed web script: org.
alfresco.web.scripts.AbstractWebScript and org.alfresco.web.scripts.
DeclarativeWebScript.
Implementing web scripts
Implementation of a web script consists of mainly four parts. These are explained in 
the following sections.
Creating a web script
Create the required files for a web script. A description document and a rendering 
template are required. You can also have a controller script and other components 
described in the earlier sections of this chapter, if required.
Storing the web script
There are two ways of storing a web script in Alfresco. We will discuss both  
these methods:
Storing it on the filesystem
If you want to store it on the filesystem, you need to store it in the  
<<alfresco_server>>/tomcat/shared/extension/templates/webscripts 
folder. You can create the desired folder structure inside this folder  
and then put all of the web script files in there.
Storing it in Alfresco Explorer
You can store the web script files in the Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web 
Scripts Extensions page. Create the required folder structure under this path as 
shown in the next screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
[ 327 ]
Click on Create Space and provide a name for the folder you want to create and click 
on the Create Space button.
Once done with the creation of folders, place the web script files, description 
document, rendering template, and controller script (if you have one) in that folder 
with the help of the Add Content option, as shown in the following screenshot:
To upload the files, click on Add Content as shown in the previous screenshot. Then 
browse to the file on your local desktop and click on OK to upload that content to the 
specified space:

[ 328 ]
Registering the web script
Once you are done with storing the required web script files, you need to register 
them in Alfresco. For registering the web scripts stored in Alfresco Explorer, navigate 
to http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/index and click on the Refresh 
Web Scripts button, as shown in the following screenshot:
You will see a message about the completion of maintenance of web scripts, which 
also specifies the number of web scripts:
Click on the Refresh Web Scripts button. You will see a message showing how 
many web scripts have recently been found and registered.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10
[ 329 ]
While registering web scripts stored on the filesystem for the first time, you need to 
restart the Alfresco server. After the web script is registered, if you change something 
in the execution script or presentation template, you can click on the Refresh Web 
Scripts button on the index page of web scripts; there is no need to restart the server.
In this way, Alfresco supports Hot Deployment of web scripts.
Listing the web scripts for external access
Once the web script is registered, you can start using it with the URL. Navigate to 
http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/index, and you will see the different 
browse options there. If you want to check it, you can click on any of the available 
browse options. Clicking on Browse by Web Script URI will browse all of the web 
scripts' URI. By doing so, you can verify your web script is there:

Integrating WCM with external 
applications—case studies
In an earlier chapter on web forms, we talked about how we can use Alfresco WCM 
for content production. Now in this section, we will discuss some of the case studies 
where the actual application is outside of Alfresco, but the content will be stored 
in Alfresco WCM and needs to be served from Alfresco only. For that, we can use 
Alfresco web scripts, which will act as an integration point for Alfresco WCM 
content and the actual application.
Integrating Alfresco WCM and Liferay with a 
news portlet
Let's consider the case where we want to have a news portlet in some Liferay Portal 
Application. So here, rendering of the portlet will be handled in Liferay, but the 
actual news content and the headlines for the news are stored in Alfresco WCM.
We have some news content stored in the /ROOT/common/inc folder, and we will try 
to fetch the headlines for these news items.
Web script for getting news headlines
In this example, we will create a web script for fetching the news headlines from 
Alfresco. We will use JavaScript as the controller and will return the response in 
XML format. This XML response will then be processed by a portlet in Liferay and 
the final news headline will be displayed on the news portlet.
Description document
The description document, getNewsHeadline.get.desc.xml, which describes the 
URL and the authentication mechanism for the web script is as follows:
<webscript>
  <shortname>Listing Of News Headlines</shortname>
  <description>Listing Of News Headlines for Cignex home page thru 
Webscript</description>
  <url>/org/cignex/news/getNewsHeadlines.xml?storeId={storeId}</url>
  <authentication>user</authentication>
</webscript>

Chapter 10
[ 331 ]
Execution script
JavaScript controller, getNewsHeadline.get.js, executes the search query to fetch 
the news items' nodes from the WCM repository. This is done using the Lucene 
Search API to search the content of a specific web form. Here in this example, it's the 
news web form. Keep in mind that this Lucene Search will only be applied to the 
Staging Sandbox of a web project. Here we have storeId as one of the web script 
parameters, but that should point to the Staging Sandbox of a web project:
var storeId = args["storeId"];
var newsNodes = new Array();
if(storeId != null) {
  var webProjectStore = avm.lookupStore(storeId);
  if(webProjectStore != null) {
    var queryForNews = "@wca\\:parentformname:news AND @cm\\:name:\"*.
xml\"";
    var resultNodes = webProjectStore.luceneSearch(queryForNews); 
    if(resultNodes != null) {
      logger.log("Reslut nodes: " + resultNodes.length);
      for (var i=0; i<resultNodes.length; i++)
      {
        newsNodes[i] = resultNodes[i];
      }
    }
  }
  if(newsNodes != null) {
    model.m_newsNodes=newsNodes;
  }
}
else{
  logger.log("ERROR: 'store' argument not specified.");
}
Response template
The rendering template for the XML response, getNewsHeading.xml.ftl file,  
is as follows:
<#ftl ns_prefixes={"D", "http://www.alfrescobook.com/webforms"}>
<news>
<#if m_newsNodes?exists>
  <#list m_newsNodes as newsNode>
    <#assign newsItemDom = newsNode.xmlNodeModel/>
    <#if newsItemDom?exists>
      <#assign newsItem = newsItemDom.news>
      <#if newsItem?exists>
        <newsItem>
          <newsId>${newsNode.name</newsId>

Storing/registering a web script in Alfresco
Once done with the development of a web script with all of the three mentioned files, 
we need to store it in an appropriate place. Let's store it through Alfresco Explorer. 
We will store the web script files in the Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web 
Scripts Extensions folder.
Create the folder structure as org/cignex/news inside the Web Scripts Extensions 
folder and upload all of the three web script-related files here, as mentioned in a 
previous section on storing a web script. After uploading, you should see all of the 
three files in the news folder, as shown in the next screenshot:
Once done with this, register the web scripts by navigating to  
http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/index and clicking on the Refresh 
Web Scripts button as mentioned before in the section on registering a web script. 
Now that the new web script is registered, we can start using it with the URL. If you 
want to check it, you can click on any of the browse options. Clicking on Browse by 
Web Script URI will browse all of the web scripts' URI. By doing so, you can verify 
your web script is there. Now we will see how to use this web script in Liferay.

Portlet in Liferay
Now in Liferay, you need to create a new portlet and call our web script from that 
portlet. The following screenshot shows a snap of a portal page where one of the 
portlets is News & Press. The content of this portlet is fetched from the Alfresco WCM:
You can download the code samples for web script-related files 
and the news portlet .war file for Liferay from the Packt website.
Integrating Alfresco WCM and Drupal with 
monthly blogs
In this case study, we will see the integration between Alfresco WCM and Drupal. 
This will be an integration of two different technologies, Java and PHP. We are going 
to take an example from monthly blogs. As in Chapter 4, Web Content Production with 
Web Forms, we have a web form for creating different blog items in the WCM. So we 
do have some blog items available with us in the WCM, which we will display on a 
Drupal page.
Web script for getting monthly blogs
Here we will have a web script that will fetch the blog content from Alfresco WCM 
for a particular month based on the published date of the blog content. We will use 
JavaScript as a controller and will return the response in HTML format. So in Drupal, 
we do not need to do any complex processing; just display the HTML as it is.

[ 334 ]
Description document
The description document, getMonthlyBlogs.get.desc.xml, which describes the 
URL and the authentication mechanism for the web script is as follows:
<webscript>
  <shortname>Listing Of Blogs</shortname>
  <description>Listing Of Blogs for Cignex home page thru Webscript 
    </description>
  <url>/org/cignex/blogs/getBlogs.xml?storeId={storeId}&amp;month= 
{monthnumber}</url>
  <authentication>user</authentication>
</webscript>
Execution script
The JavaScript controller, getMonthlyBlogs.get.js, executes the search query 
to fetch the blog items' nodes from the WCM repository. This is done using the 
Lucene Search API to search the contents of a specific web form; here it's the 
blog's web form. Keep in mind that this Lucene Search will only be applied to the 
Staging Sandbox of a web project. Here we have storeId as one of the web script 
parameters, but that should point to the Staging Sandbox of a web project:
var storeId = args["storeId"];
var blogNodes = new Array();
if(storeId != null) {
  var webProjectStore = avm.lookupStore(storeId);
  if(webProjectStore != null) {
    var queryForBlogs = "@wca\\:parentformname:blog AND @
cm\\:name:\"*.xml\"";
    var resultNodes = webProjectStore.luceneSearch(queryForBlogs); 
    if(resultNodes != null) {
      logger.log("Result nodes: " + resultNodes.length);
      for (var i=0; i<resultNodes.length; i++)
      {
        blogNodes[i] = resultNodes[i];
      }
    }
  }
  if(blogNodes != null) {
    model.m_blogNodes=blogNodes;
  }
}
else{
  logger.log("ERROR: 'store' argument not specified.");

Storing/registering the web script in Alfresco
Once done with the development of a web script with all of the mentioned files, we 
need to store it to the Web Scripts Extensions folder in Alfresco Explorer. Navigate 
to the Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Scripts Extensions folder. Create 
the folder structure as org/cignex/blogs. Upload all of the three mentioned files 
here in this folder, as shown in the following screenshot:
Once done with this, we need to register our web script. Navigate to  
http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/index and click on the Refresh  
Web Scripts button. Now that our web script is registered, we can start using it  
with the URL.
Calling the web script in Drupal
Now in Drupal, we need to create a new page where we will display this month's 
blog entries. For that we will create a new module:

You can download the code samples for web script-related files 
and blog module-related files for Drupal from the Packt website.
Integrating Alfresco WCM with any J2EE web 
application
In the previous example, we saw how we can display the news headlines on the 
news portlet. Now, in this case study, we will learn to view the details about a 
particular news item. Suppose you have any J2EE-based application and you want to 
display the news page with some specific news item. This can be integrated with the 
earlier portlet example as well, like say, on the portal home page, you have one news 
portlet, which displays the news headlines, but when you click on any news item, 
you should be able to see that particular news item. However, here we will take the 
example of any J2EE web application and we will call this web script from a normal 
JSP page.
Web script for getting the details of a 
particular news item
In this case study, as mentioned before, we will talk about the web script that will 
fetch the details of a particular news item. In this example, we will develop a Java-
backed web script so that you can have an idea about how to create Java-backed web 
scripts. The response format will be HTML.
Description document
The description document, getNewsItem.get.desc.xml, which describes the URL 
and the authentication mechanism for the web script is as follows:
<webscript>
  <shortname>Listing Of News Item</shortname>
  <description>Listing Of News Item for Cignex News page thru  
    Webscript</description>
  <url>/org/cignex/news/getNewsItem.html?storeId={storeId}&amp; 
    newsId={newsId}</url>
  <authentication>user</authentication>
</webscript>

Java-backed Bean for a web script
In this example, instead of using JavaScript as the execution script controller, we will 
use Java Bean as a controller and perform our business logic to fetch the particular 
content and process that is in this Java class.
We will create a Java Bean class named GetNewsItem, which extends the 
DeclarativeWebScript class and will override the execute method as follows:
public class GetNewsItem extends DeclarativeWebScript {
protected Map<String, Object> executeImpl(WebScriptRequest req,
      Status status) {
  // Perform the business logic here in this method
  }
}
Now, we need to configure this Bean in a Spring configuration file as a  
controller for a web script. For that we will create a configuration XML file  
named web-script-custom-context.xml in tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-
INF/classes/alfresco/extension.
Make an entry for this Java class as a Spring Bean in  
web-script-custom-context.xml as follows:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC '-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN'  
  'http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd'>
<beans>
  <!--  Web Script Storage -->
  <bean id="webscript.org.cignex.news.getNewsItem.get"  
    class="com.cignex.web.scripts.bean.news.GetNewsItem"  
    parent="webscript">
    <property name="contentService" ref="ContentService" />
    <property name="avmService" ref="AVMService" />
  </bean>
</beans>
Response template
The rendering template for the HTML response, getNewsItem.get.html.ftl file, is 
as follows:
<#ftl ns_prefixes={"D", "http://www.alfrescobook.com/news"}>
<#if m_news?exists>
  <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tr>

        <#if newsItem.contentSubHeader != "" >

        <table width="50%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <tr>
              <h4> ${newsItem.imageTitle}</h4>    
              <#if newsItem.contentGraphic != "" >
                <td>
                  <img src="${newsItem.contentGraphic}" border=0/>
                </td>
              </#if>
              </tr>
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>  ${newsItem.imageCaption}</strong>
            </td>
          </tr>0
          <tr>
            <td>
              ${newsItem.contentText}
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

</html>
Here we are fetching the details of a news item for a particular news ID, based on the 
ID passed; the details for that news item will be returned from Alfresco.

In this example, we have not used the Lucene Search API; rather we have 
used AVM APIs and this web script is flexible enough to search in any of 
the sandboxes for any web project. Suppose you want to search for some 
content in your own User Sandbox (the content is still not promoted to the 
Staging Sandbox); you can pass the store ID as wwwcignex—admin. Here 
'wwwcignex' is the web project name and 'admin' is the username, so 
wwwcignex—admin will be the sandbox of the 'wwwcignex' web project 
for a user 'admin'.
This will help in testing the content, which you have created, before 
submitting this change to the Staging Sandbox.
Storing/registering the web script in Alfresco
Once done with development of the web script with all of the three mentioned 
files, we need to store it to the Web Scripts Extensions folder in Alfresco Explorer. 
Navigate to Company Home | Data Dictionary | Web Scripts Extensions and 
create the folder structure as org/cignex/news. Upload all of the three mentioned 
files here in this folder, as shown in the next screenshot:
Once we have done this, we need to register the web scripts.
Go to http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/index and click on the Refresh 
Web Scripts button. Now that our new web script is registered, we can start using it 
with the URL.

[ 342 ]
Calling web scripts from a JSP page
Now we will create a simple JSP page from which we will make a call to our web 
script to render the news page. This JSP can be a part of any of your web applications.
To call a web script from the JSP, this will be an HTTP call. Just add the following 
scriptlet in the JSP file wherever you want to include the HTML output of this  
web script:
<%
  String resultString = "";
   
  HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
   
  client.getState().setCredentials(
  new AuthScope("localhost", 8080, "Alfresco"),
  new UsernamePasswordCredentials("admin", "admin")
  );
GetMethod get = new 
GetMethod("http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/org/cignex/news/
getNewsItem.html?storeId=wwwcignex&newsId=newsAlfrescoBookRelease.
xml");
  get.setDoAuthentication(true);
  try {
    int status = client.executeMethod( get );
    resultString = get.getResponseBodyAsString();
    out.println(resultString);
  } finally {
    get.releaseConnection();
  }
   
%>
Because we are using an HTTP client, we also need to import the used classes here  
in this scriptlet before using it. To import those, we can use the page directive of  
JSP as follows:
<%@ page import="org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient" %>
<%@ page import="org.apache.commons.httpclient.
UsernamePasswordCredentials" %>
<%@ page import="org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.AuthScope" %>
<%@ page import="org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod" %>
This will import all of the required classes.

sample web application, which is outside of Alfresco and deployed on a separate 
Tomcat web server:

[ 344 ]
Enhancing the news item web script
In this case study, we will make enhancements to the previously mentioned news 
web script. Consider a case where you have some part of the content that is being 
used in multiple places, such as some contact number, e-mail address, link URLs, 
and so on. When this kind of content needs to be modified in the future, you will 
need to modify it at multiple places. Instead, we can have a concept where we store 
this kind of content at one place and then refer that in all of the places when we want 
to actually use it. In this way, it will enable reusability and it will be easier to modify 
it in the future. No longer will we have to modify the same content at multiple 
places; we just need to modify it at one place and that will be reflected in all of the 
places where it is being used.
Consider this kind of content as tag and store it separately in one place only. We can 
then refer to it with its tag ID in the actual content when it needs to be used. This 
means we will have one tag mapping XML file where we will store all these kinds of 
tags with some ID and value. And then while creating any content, if we want to use 
it, we will refer it with the ID, and at the time of rendering the response through the 
web script, it will replace those tag IDs with actual values.
Create a TagMapping.xml file in the /ROOT/common folder under your web project 
using the tag_mapping web form.
Download the XSD file for this web 
form from the Packt website.
In the news content used in the previous case study, the website URL for the book  
is used at multiple places. We will create a tag for this and then use this tag in the 
news content.
A sample TagMapping.xml file looks like:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <items  xmlns:alf="http://www.alfresco.org" xmlns:chiba="http://
chiba.sourceforge.net/xforms" xmlns:ev="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-
events" xmlns:xf="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms" xmlns:xhtml="http://
www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
   <item>
     <id>phone_number</id>
     <value>1-408-923-4231</value>
   </item>
   <item>
   <id>book_website</id>

   <value>http://www.packtpub.com/alfresco-3-enterprise-content- 
     management-implementation/book/mid/160609knbhtv</value>
   </item>
   </items>
Here we have created a tag for the URL of the website for our Alfresco book with ID 
book_website, and in value we have specified the URL for this.
Now when we create XML content for the news, wherever we want to mention  
the book URL, instead of writing the actual URL, we will refer this tag with ID  
book_website as:
<a href="${book_website}">Alfresco 3 Enterprise Content Management 
Implementation</a>
We need to use it as ${tag_id} only (syntax for a FreeMarker template), because 
we are going to use the template service to replace this tag's runtime with the actual 
value of this tag.
Web script for getting the details of a 
particular news item
Now let's look at the web script changes for this. In this example, we will see how we 
can fetch the details of an individual news item.
Description document
The description document, getNewsItem.get.desc.xml, will be the same as used in 
the previous example.
Java-backed Bean for web scripts
We use the same Java Bean class, GetNewsItem, which extends the 
DeclarativeWebScript class, but we will modify this class as follows:
1.	 Render the intermediate template model (getNewsItem.get.html.model.
ftl) with the renderTemplate method of template service as:
renderTemplate(templatePath, map, out);
where templatePath is the path for the file getNewsItem.get.html.model.
ftl, map is the model map of the news item, and out is used to store the 
intermediate result of this rendering.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Integrating WCM Using Web Scripts
[ 346 ]
2.	 Create a tag model map by processing the TagMapping.xml file.
3.	 Then process this tag model over the result of that intermediate template 
rendering with the processTagging method of template service as:
result = templateService.processTemplateString(
        "freemarker", template, modelMap);
where freemarker indicates the use of FreeMarker as the template processor, 
template is the intermediate result generated by rendering of the template in 
the previous step, modelMap is the model map created by processing the tag 
mapping file, and result will hold the final result after replacing all of the 
tags with actual values.
Here we are using the template service to render and process the  
FreeMarker template.
4.	 Now in the Spring Bean configuration file, web-script-custom-context.xml, 
in the tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/extension 
folder, we need to add template service as a property for that Bean as we are 
using this new service for our example as:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC '-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN'  
  'http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd'>
<beans>
   <!--  Web Script Storage -->
  <bean id="webscript.org.cignex.news.getNewsItem.get" class="com.
cignex.web.scripts.bean.news.GetNewsItem" parent="webscript">
    <property name="contentService" ref="ContentService" />
    <property name="avmService" ref="AVMService" />
    <property name="templateService" ref="TemplateService" />
  </bean>
</beans>
Response template
The intermediate rendering template for the HTML response, the getNewsItem.
get.html.model.ftl file is as follows:
<#ftl ns_prefixes={"D", "http://www.alfrescobook.com/news"}>
<#if m_news?exists>
  <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tr>
    <#assign newsItem = m_news>
      <td>

          <h4>${newsItem.contentSubHeader}</h4>
        </#if>
    
        <table width="50%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <tr>
              <h4> ${newsItem.imageTitle}</h4>    
              <#if newsItem.contentGraphic != "" >
                <td>
                  <img src="${newsItem.contentGraphic}" border=0/>
                </td>
              </#if>
              </tr>
            </td>
              <td>
                <strong>  ${newsItem.imageCaption}</strong>       
              </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
                ${newsItem.contentText}
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</#if>
</html>
And finally, the rendering template, the getNewsItem.get.html.ftl file, is:

In the Communication with Web Content Management section of Chapter 9, we have 
already explained the configuration required at Surf side to call web scripts from 
Alfresco, along with a UI web script that will be responsible for rendering the page. 
And the web script we mentioned earlier in this section is a data web script, which 
will be responsible for fetching content from the repository.
In Surf, we have already created a header web script to display the main page. We 
have also created a web script to display the news header in Surf. Now we will call 
the news web script in the same (header) web script to integrate news headline on 
the same page.
The following screenshot shows the main page from the Surf application where we 
have integrated the WCM web script. Content is fetched from the repository:

Summary
In this chapter, we covered the REST architecture at high level and saw how an 
Alfresco web script allows users to integrate Alfresco with any external application 
easily, independent of the technology. In this way, you can use Alfresco WCM 
purely for content authoring and as a content production system without worrying 
about the frontend rendering of it. Hence, the same Alfresco WCM content can be 
used and rendered in different ways with multiple applications. Again, web scripts 
support different output formats, including XML, JSON, and so on, so you can 
generate the output in the format expected by the frontend application very easily. 
Mainly we discussed:
• 
REST architecture and web script framework in Alfresco
• 
Different components of a web script
• 
How to develop web scripts in Alfresco
• 
How to integrate Alfresco WCM with external systems using web scripts
In the next chapter, we will discuss how we can leverage the Alfresco framework  
for WCM.

Leveraging Alfresco 
Framework for WCM
Alfresco is the leading provider of open source Enterprise Content Management 
and provides Enterprise grade, scalable, robust, portable, and reliable solutions for 
managing any type of content, including documents, digital assets, and web content. 
Alfresco has different modules to manage different kinds of content. Document 
Management (DM) and Web Content Management (WCM) are the two main and 
widely used modules of Alfresco.
Alfresco Document Management captures, shares, and retains content, enabling 
users to version, search, and simply build their own content applications. The 
Alfresco Web Content Management allows organizations to rapidly create and 
more effectively maintain dynamic Internet, intranet, and extranet sites, enabling 
a shortened web development cycle, providing high return on investment and 
low cost of ownership. Alfresco framework is built on state-of-the-art open source 
frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, Lucene, and JSF. DM and WCM are two 
different feature sets that are built on the common infrastructure framework of 
Alfresco and also have services such as security, workflow, library, search, and so 
on, which can be used across the application for any module. In this chapter, we will 
discuss how you can leverage the Alfresco DM features for the WCM and cover the 
following topics for WCM:
• 
Membership and Security Mechanisms
• 
FFMPEG Integration
• 
DM content in WCM
• 
Image Transformation
• 
Advance Search
• 
Metadata Extractor

[ 354 ]
Membership and Security Mechanism
The Alfresco security model is flexible and allows you to choose either its built-
in security or an external security model defined by your organization, by using 
systems such as LDAP and Active Directory. You will understand various 
security models and learn to choose the one that is most suited to your enterprise's 
requirements. The Alfresco membership system is highly scalable and can cater to 
a number of users and content managers. The Alfresco WCM can also leverage the 
security mechanism provided by Alfresco DM.
Consider a case where we have people from different departments for any company 
who need to access the Alfresco WCM system. These companies already have  
their own directory-based Central Authentication System. Here you can have  
two possibilities:
• 
Use Alfresco's out-of-the-box membership system and create the user 
accounts for all those users in Alfresco.
• 
Configure Alfresco with LDAP for centralized Identity Management where 
all the users from existing directory LDAP will be imported in Alfresco 
if they need to access Alfresco and will be authenticated via Central 
Authentication System-LDAP.
As the company is already having their own directory, the second approach would 
be proffered. We can configure Alfresco with LDAP and import the users in Alfresco. 
Once the users are available in Alfresco, we can easily associate the users to the web 
project in Alfresco WCM. This is already described in Chapter 3, Getting Started with 
Alfresco WCM. You can refer to this chapter for further details.
Configuring LDAP for centralized identity 
management
LDAP evolved from X.500 OSI Directory Access Protocol. LDAP directory is 
the central authentication engine for the enterprise, and serves as the yellow 
pages for user access and profile information. The biggest advantage of LDAP is 
that your enterprise can access the LDAP directory from almost any computing 
platform, using any one of the increasing number of readily available LDAP-aware 
applications. In fact, LDAP is finding much wider industrial acceptance because of 
its status as an Internet standard.

Chapter 11
[ 355 ]
You can use LDAP with any directory server, such as iPlanet, Novell's eDirectory, 
Microsoft's Active Directory, or OpenLDAP. If you are planning to implement 
an LDAP directory in your organization, you may consider OpenLDAP, Active 
Directory, or eDirectory. OpenLDAP is a stable and widely accepted open source 
directory server.
LDAP configuration with Active Directory
Active Directory supports LDAP-based authentication. It can also support 
authentication using JAAS+Kerberos and NTLM authentication. Only NTLM will 
give you a Single-Sign-On solution. It is possible to use any authentication methods 
against an Active Directory server and extract user and group information via LDAP.
For the LDAP to work with Alfresco, you have to make some changes in the 
configuration files.
Follow the steps given below to configure LDAP-based authentication with  
Active Directory.
1.	 Open the <alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEBINF/classes/
alfresco/subsystems/Authentication/ldap/ldap-authentication.
properties file and modify the properties to your required value as follows. 
All other properties can be kept as it is in the file.

To configure LDAP as an authentication mechanism, you need to change this 
property. Provide ldap:ldap for LDAP Authentication as follows:
authentication.chain=ldap:ldap
3.	 Open the file-server-custom.xml file. Add the following code:

This authentication mechanism sends usernames and passwords in plain text. It is the 
most simple to set up. This is supported by both Active Directory and OpenLDAP.
LDAP synchronization
As you have already configured LDAP with Active Directory, the next step will be 
to extract information from Active Directory. This synchronization of people and 
groups between the Alfresco repository and LDAP is supported by scheduled jobs. 
These jobs extract the user or group information from the LDAP repository and 
create the appropriate information as an Alfresco import XML file. This file is then 
imported into the repository.

Follow these steps to export users and groups from Active Directory:
1.	 Open the <alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/subsystems/Authentication/ldap/ldap-authentication.
properties file. Modify the properties to the required value as follows. All 
other properties can be kept as is in the file:
°°
ldap.synchronization.java.naming.security.
principal=admin
(the user that has read access to the group and people information to be 
extracted from Active Directory server)
°°
ldap. synchronization.java.naming.security.
credentials=secret
(the password for the user defined above)
°°
ldap.synchronization.personQuery=(objectclass= 
inetOrgPerson)
°°
ldap.synchronization.userSearchBase=dc=company,dc=com
(these two options combine to make the query to find people. In the  
previous example, you will find all objects of type inetOrgPerson  
anywhere in the directory)
°°
ldap.synchronization.groupQuery=(objectclass= 
groupOfNames)
°°
ldap.synchronization.groupSearchBase=dc=example,dc=com
(these two options combine to make the query to find groups. In the  
previous example, you will find all objects of type groupOfNames anywhere 
in the directory)
2.	 Ensure that your earlier changes are saved. Start Alfresco. On restarting, you 
will be able to log into the Alfresco repository with LDAP users only.
Daisy Chaining
If you want to log into the Alfresco repository with Alfresco users also, then you 
have to make some more changes in the configuration files. This concept is called 
Daisy Chaining, allowing the users to configure multiple authentication components 
for Authentication.
With version 3.2, Alfresco has introduced the concept of sub-systems.  
A sub-system is a configurable module responsible for a subpart of Alfresco 
functionality. Authentication is one of such sub-systems available in 3.2, which  
is a stack of multiple components responsible for Authentication in Alfresco.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 11
[ 359 ]
For more information on Alfresco Authentication sub-systems, you can refer to 
the Wiki link: http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Authentication_
Subsystems.
With this approach, Authentication sub-systems are easily chained. So, now it's  
very easy to configure the Chaining authentication. The steps to configure Chaining 
are as follows:
1.	 Open the <alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco-global.
properties file and uncomment the following line:
authentication.chain=alfrescoNtlm1:alfrescoNtlm
2.	 To configure more than one authentication component for chaining, you  
can add as many authenticators as you want separated by a comma as 
mentioned below:
authentication.chain=ldap1:ldap,ldap2:ldap, 
alfrescoNtlm:alfrescoNtlm
Here we have three different authenticators for Chaining Authentication; 
ldap1 and ldap2 are for LDAP Authentication and alfrescoNtlm is for 
Default Alfresco Authentication. For authenticating the users, when a user 
logs into the system, Alfresco checks for authentication in the sequence as 
defined above.
3.	 Configuration files for ldap1 and ldap2 are created as follows:
Copy <alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/subsystems/Authentication/ldap/ldap-authentication.
properties to <alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/
subsystems/Authentication/ldap1/ldap-authentication.properties.
Copy <alfresco>/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/
alfresco/subsystems/Authentication/ldap/ldap-authentication.
properties to <alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/
subsystems/Authentication/ldap2/ldap-authentication.properties.
4.	 Now, modify this property file for ldap1 and ldap2 accordingly to provide 
the LDAP configuration details in both the files. Configuring LDAP is 
already explained in the previous section.
5.	 Restart the server and you can verify the chaining by logging in with an 
Alfresco local user and the LDAP user as well.

the Packt website.

User roles
In the previous section, we discussed the different Authentication mechanisms for 
users in Alfresco. Once the user is part of Alfresco, either created in Alfresco or 
imported from LDAP or any other system, you can assign different roles to the user 
for providing specific permissions. The users and default roles to these users are 
controlled globally in Alfresco, which also affects the WCM.
By default, only the admin user has permission to create a web project in the 
Company Home | Web Projects folder. All the users of the system will have 
Consumer role by default for this folder. That means those users can have just "read" 
permission for the Web Projects folder; they really cannot create a web project. If 
you want to allow any other user to create a web project other than admin, then an 
admin can assign a Contributor or higher role to that user and then that user can get 
rights to create a new web project.
There are different roles available in Alfresco, which users can be assigned to. 
Following are the five basic roles:
• 
Consumer: Read only permission
• 
Contributor: Consumer + Permission to add/create new content
• 
Editor: Consumer + Permission to edit the existing content
• 
Collaborator: Contributor + Editor
• 
Coordinator: Collaborator + Permission to delete the content
As mentioned here, to create a web project, a user at least needs the Contributor role.
Another scenario is if you remove the default consumer roles available to all the users 
for the Company Home | Web Projects space, then even if the user is a member of 
some web project, he will not be able to see the Web Project folder. Therefore, the user 
will not have access to that web project of which he is also a member.
So, in this way you are controlling the users from outside the Web  
Content Management.

Common repository
As a Content Management Product, Alfresco has two different modules, DM  
and WCM.
In this section, we will see how we can use Alfresco with the combination of DM and 
WCM both as a single repository. Consider a use case of a company where they are 
using Alfresco WCM for managing their website but at the same time they have an 
Intranet application, which is more for managing documents and other assets. For 
this Intranet, they are using the Alfresco DM. Now suppose some of the documents/
assets need to be managed in DM but are basically part of the website and need to be 
deployed. In this scenario, we can get the advantage of both the DM and WCM in the 
same repository.
Let's take the example of the Cignex company. As we have already seen in the 
earlier chapter, the website for Cignex is managed by Alfresco WCM. But in this 
website, some of the images, videos, and so on are being used, which are managed 
in DM. There are some departments such as Marketing, Sales, HR, IT, and many 
more available that are using this Intranet application. Now if a Marketing person is 
uploading a video, then he or she may have some requirements such as it should be 
transformed into different formats like 3GP (for cell phones), MPEG4 (for iPod), and 
Flash (the default format for the website). Alfresco can be integrated with FFMPEG, 
using which we can easily transform the videos to other formats.
Integrating Alfresco with the FFMPEG Video 
Transcoder
FFMPEG is a very popular high performance video and audio transcoder. It has 
various widely used commercial tools to convert audio and video files from one 
format to another. It is basically a command-line interface. We can easily integrate 
any such command-line applications with Alfresco.
You need to download the FFMPEG binary version for Microsoft Windows and 
put it into the <alfresco_install>/bin directory. The command used for 
transformation is:
ffmpeg.exe -i [input_file.extension] [options] [output_file.extension]

Various options for video transcoding
Following are the various options for video transcoding:
• 
-b bitrate
Set the video bitrate in bit/s (default = 200 kb/s).
=>512 k
• 
-r fps
Set frame rate (Hz value, fraction, or abbreviation), (default = 25).
=>15.02
• 
-s size
Set frame size. The format is 'wxh' (ffserver default = 160x128, ffmpeg default 
= same as source).
=>320x240
• 
-aspect aspect
Set aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9 or 1.3333, 1.7777).
=>4:3
Various options for audio transcoding
Following are the various options for audio transcoding:
• 
-ar freq
Set the audio sampling frequency (default = 44100 Hz).
=> 44100
• 
-ab bitrate
Set the audio bitrate in bit/s (default = 64 k).
=> 64 k
• 
-ac channels
Set the number of audio channels (default = 1 Mono; 2 = stereo).
=> 2

Integrating transformation as an Action in Alfresco
In this section, we will see how we can use FFMPEG transformations as a custom 
action in Alfresco. From there we can trigger some business rules on the spaces, 
which will execute this custom action to perform transformation of all video files. 
Follow these steps to execute the transformation:
1.	 We need to configure the extra mime types that we want to use. Here in our 
case, we are using 3GP, MP2, MP4, AVI, MOV, and many more. All others are 
already supported by Alfresco and are defined in the mimetype-map.xml file 
in Alfresco (except 3GP). So we need to add 3GP as a mimetype supported by 
Alfresco in the mimetype-map file, as follows:
<config evaluator="string-compare" condition="Mimetype Map">
  <mimetypes>
    <mimetype mimetype="video/3gp" display="Mobile video">
        <extension>3gp</extension>
    </mimetype>
  </mimetypes>
</config>
2.	 The next step is, as FFMPEG is a command-line interface, we can use 
Alfresco's org.alfresco.util.exec.RuntimeExec class to execute this 
command. For that we need to configure it as a bean, which will be referred 
by our custom action executer. We can make these bean entries in the 
custom-services-context.xml file.
<bean id="transformer.ffmpegVideo"  
   class="com.cignex.alfresco.repo.content.transform. 
          FfmpegVideoContentTransformer"
   parent="baseContentTransformer"
   init-method=»init»>
  <property name=»executer»>
      <bean name=»transformer.ffmpegVideo.Command»  
           class=»org.alfresco.util.exec.RuntimeExec»>
          <property name=»commandMap»>
              <map>
               <entry key=»Windows.*»>
                <value>ffmpeg -i «${source}» ${options}  
                       «${target}»</value>
               </entry>
              </map>
           </property>
           <property name=»defaultProperties»>
              <props>
                  <prop key="options"></prop>

       FfmpegVideoTransformActionExecuter"
        parent=»transform»>
        <property name=»videoContentTransformer»>
            <ref bean=»transformer.ffmpegVideo» />
        </property>
</bean>
3.	 In the web-client-config-custom.xml file, add the following:
<config evaluator="string-compare" condition="Action Wizards">
<video-transformers>
      <transformer name="video/x-msvideo"/>
      <transformer name="video/mp4"/> 
      <transformer name="video/3gp"/>
      <transformer name="video/x-ms-wmv"/>
</video-transformers>
<action-handlers>
  <handler name="transform-video" 
    class="com.cignex.alfresco.web.bean.actions.handlers. 
           FfmpegTransformVideoHandler" />
</action-handlers>
</config>
4.	 Here you can specify all transformer names, and the formats you want to 
support in the transform action from the Alfresco UI as:
<transformer name="video/mp4"/>
5.	 You can add more if you want; here we have configured four  
different formats.
6.	 Once this is done, you need to create custom Action Executer classes and do 
the configurations for this.
You can also refer to the following Wikis for more detail on these:

7.	 After finishing creation and configuration of the Action Executer, you are 
ready with the example code. Now start the Alfresco server and we will see 
how you can configure the rule for transformation.
8.	 We will create the folder structure such as Company Home | Cignex | 
videos. Inside the videos space, create spaces for all different types of formats 
(for video) that you want to support (that is, MPEG4, 3GP, and so on).
Configuring FFMPEG transformation as a  
business rule
Alfresco DM provides the business rule; you can configure a business rule for a 
particular type of content or for all the content in a particular space. Here we will 
configure a business rule on the videos space to transform the videos we upload in 
this space to convert into other formats.
1.	 Browse to Company Home | Cignex | videos and click on More Actions | 
Manage Content Rules. On the next screen, click on the Create Rule link. In 
the first step of the Create Rule Wizard, select All Items and click on Add to 
List. Click on Next.
2.	 In the next step, you can see the action created by us in the Select Action 
combo box. Select the action Transform video using FFMPEG and copy, as 
shown in the following screenshot. Click on Next:
www.it-ebooks.info

[ 366 ]
3.	 In the next step, you need to select the proper value for the required format 
(the target format for transformation). As we have configured 3GP, MP4, 
AVI, and WMV in the configuration file, we will have all these four options 
available to us for transforming the video. After that, provide the proper 
options for a particular video transformation selection based on source- and 
target-type of video file. Also, you need to provide the destination space to 
copy the transformed video. Here we have created the 3GP space inside the 
videos folder, so provide it as a destination folder. Click on OK.
4.	 In the next step, choose Type as Inbound; also provide Title and 
Description. Check the option Apply rule to sub spaces as shown in the 
following screenshot. Click on Finish:

Now whenever you upload any video in videos space, it will be transformed into the 
3GP video format. It will also be copied to the 3GP space inside the videos space as 
shown in the next screenshot:
You can create as many rules and transformations as you want to perform for 
different video types.
Download the sample code files 
from the Packt website.
Copying videos from DM to WCM
In this section, we will discuss the different ways to copy the content—here videos 
from DM to WCM. One is with the help of business rule and the other one is using 
JavaScript. Both of these are described in the following sections.
DM to WCM using business rule
We have videos available in all required formats under Company Home | Cignex | 
videos and the respective folders for the video formats. Now we need to move these 
videos in WCM in the proper web project and to the proper folder.

There is one more rule available in DM, which will copy the DM content to WCM. 
For this, you need to configure that rule. Use the following steps:
1.	 Browse to Company Home | Cignex | videos and click on More Actions | 
Manage Content Rules. In the next screen, click on the Create Rule link. In 
the first step of the Create Rule Wizard, select All Items and click on Add to

[ 370 ]
DM to WCM using JavaScript
There is one API available in Alfresco JavaScript, which allows you to copy content 
from one repository to another. Using this API, you can copy the content from DM 
to WCM. Here we will copy all the videos, which we transformed previously to a 
specific folder in the web project.
Alfresco JavaScript has crossRepoCopy as one of the root objects, using which 
we can copy nodes or content between the different repositories (Document 
Management and Web Content Management).
copy(ScriptNode source, ScriptNode destination, String name): This will 
copy a source node to the specified destination node and return the new node. In 
the parameter name, you can specify the new name for that content, which is being 
copied to some other location.
Using this API, we can copy all of the transformed video from the DM repository to 
the WCM repository, as follows:
1.	 Create new JavaScript file, copy_wcm.js, with the following content:
logger.log("Document :: " + document.name);
var l_cignex_root=avm.lookupStore("wwwcignex--admin");
l_video_path="/ROOT/videos";
if(l_cignex_root != null) {
  l_videoNode = l_cignex_root.lookupNode(l_video_path + "/");
  if(l_videoNode != null){
    crossRepoCopy.copy(document,l_videoNode,document.name);
    logger.log(document.name + " is copied");
  }
}
2.	 Upload this JavaScript file to the Company Home | Data Dictionary | 
Scripts space in Alfresco.

3.	 Now, with the help of Run Action, you can execute this script. Go to the 
View Details page of the video content, which you want to copy to the 
WCM. Click on Run Action from the available actions, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

[ 372 ]
4.	 Choose Execute a script from the available list of actions and click on the 
Set Values and Add button. Select copy_wcm.js from the list of available 
JavaScript files to execute and click on OK.
5.	 Click on Finish. This will execute the copy_wcm.js JavaScript and copy 
the content to the WCM in a specified web project and a specified folder, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
You can also configure this 'Execute Script' as a rule on the videos 
folder. For configuring it as a business rule, you can follow the 
same steps as mentioned in the DM to WCM Using Business Rule 
section. Just choose the Execute a Script action during configuration 
and copy_wcm.js as a value.
If you configure this rule for Inbound Documents, it will 
automatically copy the videos file to the corresponding destination 
folder in WCM.
Image transformation in WCM
Alfresco leverages the power of ImageMagick for image transformations. Refer 
to Chapter 2, Installation and Configuration for installing ImageMagick. Alfresco 
JavaScript provides some APIs to perform image transformations. The prerequisite 
for this is to have ImageMagick installed. The Script node has the APIs mentioned in 
the following section for image transformation.

Image transformation APIs
Alfresco provides the following APIs for image transformations. transformImage  
is overloaded with different parameters. You can use any of these based on  
your requirement:
• 
transformImage(string mimetype): This will transform an image to a new 
type specified in mimetype and will return the transformed image node if 
successful or null if failed.
• 
transformImage(string mimetype, string options): This will 
transform an image to a new type specified in mimetype by applying the 
supplied ImageMagick options and will return the transformed image node 
if successful or null if failed.
• 
transformImage(string mimetype, ScriptNode destination): This 
will transform an image to a new type specified in mimetype and will return 
the transformed image node if successful or null if failed. A new image 
document will be created in specified destination folder.
• 
transformImage(string mimetype, string options, ScriptNode 
destination): This will transform an image to a new type specified in 
mimetype by applying the supplied ImageMagick options and will return 
the transformed image node if successful or null if failed. A new image 
document will be created in the specified destination folder.
Configuring new action for image 
transformation in WCM
Following are the steps to configure image transformation as an action in Alfresco.
1.	 Configure action for transform image in web-client-config-custom.xml 
file as:
<config>
<actions>
  <!-- Transform Image Action -->
    <action id="tranform_image">
      <permissions>
         <permission allow="true">Write</permission>
      </permissions>

      </params>
      <target>new</target>
    </action>
    </actions>
  </config>
2.	 Add this action in the action group for avm_file_browse in the  
web-client-config-custom.xml file, as follows:
<config>
<actions>
  <action-group id="avm_file_browse" replace="true">
      <show-link>false</show-link>
      <action idref="edit_file" />
      <action idref="update_file" />
      <action idref="preview_file" />
      <action idref="cut_avm_node" />
      <action idref="copy_avm_node" />
      <action idref="file_details" />
      <action idref="unlock_file" />
      <action idref="delete_file_browse" />
      <action idref="tranform_image" />
  </action-group>
</actions>
</config>
3.	 Now we need to create JavaScript file, which will be executed when this 
action is performed. This JavaScript will be responsible for transforming the 
image. The JavaScript transform_image.js will look as follows:
logger.log("called :: " + args["id"]);
var path = args["id"];
var node = avm.lookupNode(path) 
logger.log("node : "+ node);
var thumbImage = node.transformImage("image/png", "-resize 
120",node.parent);
4.	 Here, you can specify any image type for transformation instead of  
image/png and also can specify the required options as the second  
argument in transformImage API.

folder as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Now the new action for Image Transformation will be available for any 
content in WCM.

Advanced search in WCM
The success of content management systems depends on its ability to locate the 
required content with fewer clicks. You will realize the benefits of having a  
powerful search engine when you have a large amount of content in your content 
management system.
Unlike many commercial content management systems, Alfresco includes a free and 
very powerful search engine called Lucene as part of installation. Hence you don't 
have to buy and install a third-party search engine. And moreover, you don't have to 
deal with integration issues and upgrades.
In Alfresco DM, you will be able to search both content and properties. You can do 
a full-text search on any word in content, regardless of the format. You can search 
for content in a particular space. You can also search for content belonging to certain 
categories or of a specific type. We will leverage this searching capability of Alfresco 
DM in WCM as well with the help of the Lucene search engine. In this section, we 
will see how we can use Lucene to search the content stored in Alfresco WCM and 
easily do a full-text search on any word in content, regardless of the format.
Searching in WCM is similar to the searching in DM, but in WCM, Lucene-based 
search is only possible in the Staging Sandbox. It is not possible for any User's 
Sandbox or also the Workflow Sandbox. XPath-based searching is possible for all 
the WCM stores including User's Sandbox and Workflow Sandbox. However, the 
drawback of XPath search is that the performance might slow down depending on 
the query and the store structure, as the implementation walks the object model.

WCM search can be performed via Java, JavaScript, FreeMarker template, or the 
Node Browser.
For more information on search, refer to http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Search.
Using JavaScript
Using JavaScript API for search, you can search the content against WCM stores. 
Alfresco provides search as a root object for JavaScript, which provides access to 
Lucene search. The available APIs to perform search are:
• 
luceneSearch(string query): This will perform a full-text Lucene search 
with the provided query and return the search result as an array of Script 
node objects.
• 
luceneSearch(string store, string query): This will perform a  
full-text Lucene search in the specified store with the provided query and 
return the search result as an array of Script node objects.
• 
luceneSearch(string query, string sortColumn, boolean asc): This 
will perform a full-text Lucene search with the provided query and return 
the sorted search result based on the column specified and the sorting order 
as an array of Script node objects.
• 
luceneSearch(string store, string query, string sortColumn, 
boolean asc): This will perform a full-text Lucene search in the specified 
store with the provided query and return the sorted search result based on 
the column specified and the sorting order as an array of Script node objects.
• 
xpathSearch(string xpath): This will perform an Alfresco XPath search 
and return the search result as an array of Script node objects.
• 
xpathSearch(string store, string xpath): This will perform an 
Alfresco XPath search in the specified store and return the search result as an 
array of Script node objects.
• 
ScriptNode findNode(NodeRef noderef): This will return a Script node 
for the specified noderef.
• 
ScriptNode findNode(string noderef): This will return a Script node for 
the specified noderef in the form of String.

Here for the Lucene query, you can pass any valid Lucene query as an argument. 
While building the Lucene query, you can use multiple query criteria with 
combination of relational operator. For example, to search text "cignex", you can have 
the query as TEXT:cignex, as follows:
var results = search.luceneSearch("avm://wwwcignex","TEXT:cignex");
This will search for the text "cignex" in wwwcignex store (Staging Sandbox of the web 
project named wwwcignex).
Now if you want to restrict the search to some specific folder within the store, you 
can have path criteria in the query as PATH:"www/avm_webapps/ROOT/common//*", 
as follows:
var results = search.luceneSearch("avm://wwwcignex","TEXT:cignex" AND 
PATH:\"www/avm_webapps/ROOT/common//*\"");
AVM API to search in WCM store
Alfresco provides search APIs to perform search in the Alfresco Repository. The 
following is the API used to perform Lucene search in WCM.
• 
store.luceneSearch(query): This will perform a Lucene search with the 
provided query against the store and return the search result as an array of 
AVM nodes.
To perform the search on a particular store, you need to get the store first and then 
you can execute search against that store, that is:
var store = avm.lookupStore("wwwcignex");
var results = store.luceneSearch("wca\\:parentformname:news");
Using FreeMarker template
Similar to JavaScript, FreeMarker template language also provides the API to 
perform the search against the WCM stores; the API is:
• 
store.luceneSearch(query): This will perform a Lucene search with the 
provided query against the store and return the search result as an array of 
AVM nodes.
For example, to search all the folders in the web project, you can have the query  
as follows:
<#assign store = avm.lookupStore("wwwcignex)>
<list store.luceneSearch(TYPE:"cm:folder") as l_search_result>
  <li> ${l_search_result.properties.name} </li>
<#list>

Using the Node browser
You can use the Node browser available in Alfresco Explorer to search the content in 
the WCM stores. But only Admin users can have access to Node Browser. In order to 
use the Node browser:
1.	 Click on the Administration Console button (
)on the top menu bar.
2.	 Click on the Node Browser option on the Administration console screen.
3.	 It will have a list of all the stores of repository. Select the appropriate WCM 
store in which you want to perform the search.
4.	 In the combo box for Search, select the Search Language, that is, lucene or 
xpath, and so on.
5.	 In the Search text area, provide the search query for the specific language.
6.	 Click on Search. It will perform the search and return the result nodes.
Using Java
Java also provides Search Service to perform the search operations. The APIs 
available in search service to execute search are as follows:
• 
query(Storeref store, String language, String query): This will 
search against the specified store in WCM with the given query and language.
• 
query(Storeref store, String language, String query, 
QueryParameterDefinition[] queryParameterDefinition): This will 
search against the specified store in WCM with the given query language and 
Query Parameters. Here you can have a parameterized query.

• 
query(Storeref store, Qname queryId, QueryParameter[] 
queryParameters): This will execute a canned query against the specified 
store with the given query identifier and query parameters.
• 
query(SearchParameters searchParameters): This will perform search 
using the specified Search Parameters.
All of the previous APIs for search using search service available in Alfresco will 
return Search results as a ResultSet. You can iterate this result set and perform any 
further processing.
Case study: User Interface for Advanced 
Search in WCM
In this section, we will discuss the case study of UI for Advance Search in WCM. 
Here we will provide different criteria for search, such as choosing the web form of 
which we want to search the content and the facility to choose the path in the ROOT 
folder to search the content. For this we will use Lucene search so that it will search 
only in a Staging Sandbox.
This search example is for free text-based search and does not provide the capability 
to search the content based on its property. We will see the example of searching 
content based on the content property in the next section.
To implement this functionality:
1.	 Provide a link for Advance Search in the browse-sandbox.jsp page as:
<div style="float:right;padding-right:20px;padding-top:3px">
<a:actionLink id="advance-search-image" value="Advance 
Search" image="/images/icons/search_icon.gif" showLink="false" 
showLink="false" action="advanceSearch" />
<a:actionLink id="advance-search-apply" value="Advance Search" 
showLink="false" action="advanceSearch" />
</div>
2.	 Create a new JSP file in the jsp/extension/wcm/search folder for rendering 
the Search UI Page.

3.	 Add a managed bean definition in the faces-config-custom.xml file. This 
bean is going to handle search parameter retrieval process for Advanced 
Search JSP.
<managed-bean>
      <description>
       The bean that holds a state for the Advanced Search screen.
      </description>
<managed-bean-name>CustomAdvancedSearchBean</managed-bean-name>

         <property-name>serviceRegistry</property-name>
         <value>#{ServiceRegistry}</value>
      </managed-property>     
</managed-bean>
4.	 Implement class com.cignex.web.bean.wcm.CustomAdvancedSearchBean 
and implement a method [public Search ()] that will perform the search 
with the specified parameters. This class will also have corresponding fields 
for all search components.
5.	 Create a Java class, CustomAdvanceSearchBean, with the specified package 
structure, which will actually perform the search in the repository.

current web project:
Metadata extraction for WCM
The case study we discussed in the previous section was for the free text search 
with advanced search criteria in the WCM. In this section, we will discuss how 
we can perform the search based on the metadata of particular content. Alfresco 
provides some of the metadata extractors, which are responsible for extracting the 
metadata from the added or updated content at the server side. Alfresco has different 
extractors for handling different types of mimetypes for DM.

[ 385 ]
In this section, we will see how we can configure XML Metadata Extractor for WCM. 
We will take the example of news content, which we are creating with the help of a 
news web form.
1.	 To Activate metadata extraction for WCM, rename the wcm-xml-metadata-
extracter-context.xml.sample file available in the <alf_home>/tomcat/
shared/classes/alfresco/extension folder to wcm-xml-metadata-
extracter-context.xml. This file will have bean declaration for WCM 
Metadata extraction, as follows:
<bean id="avmMetadataExtracterRegistry"
    class="org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata. 
    MetadataExtracterRegistry" />
      ...
      <property name="invokePolicies">
         <value>true</value>
      </property>
      ...
      <property name="metadataExtracterRegistry">
         <ref bean="avmMetadataExtracterRegistry" />
      </property>
      ...
</bean>
2.	 The AVMNodeService fires policies for content creation and update that are 
listened to by avmMetadataExtractors, which is responsible for initiating 
the metadata extraction for content newly created or updated.
3.	 To configure an extractor to handle XML content, first we need to configure 
XpathMetadataExtracter, as follows:
<property name="xpathMappingProperties">
  <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config. 
    PropertiesFactoryBean">
     <property name="location">
       <value>
         classpath:alfresco/extension/News-Xpath-Mappings. 
           properties
       </value>
     </property>
  </bean>
</property>
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Leveraging Alfresco Framework for WCM
[ 386 ]
Here, News-Xpath-Mappings.properties stored in the alfresco/
extension folder will have mappings of XPath as follows:
# Name Space
namespace.prefix.trn=http://www.alfrescobook.com/webforms
# XPATH Mappings
short_title=news/shortTitle/text()
content_header=news/contentHeader/text()
content_sub_header=news/contentSubHeader/text()
news_date=news/newsDate/text()
4.	 Now we need to map this property with the properties of a content model; 
for that again, we need to configure property as follows:
<property name="mappingProperties">
  <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config. 
    PropertiesFactoryBean">
    <property name="location">
      <value>classpath:alfresco/extension/Content-Model-Mappings. 
        properties
      </value>
    </property>
  </bean>
</property>
5.	 Here Content-Model-Mappings.properties stored in the alfresco/
extension folder will have a mapping of properties of the content model as:
namespace.prefix.cignex=http://www.cignex.com
# Mappings
short_title=shortTitle
content_header=contentHeader
content_sub_header=contentSubHeader
news_date=newsDate
6.	 Now we need to select the extractor as XMLMetadataExtractor and 
configure bean for this as:
<bean id="extracter.xml.sample.XMLMetadataExtracter"
         class="org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.xml.
XmlMetadataExtracter"
         parent="baseMetadataExtracter">
      <property name="registry">
         <ref bean="avmMetadataExtracterRegistry" />
      </property>
      <property name="overwritePolicy">
         <value>EAGER</value>
      </property>
      <property name="selectors">
         <list>

[ 387 ]
        <ref bean="extracter.xml.sample.selector.XPathSelector" />
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
7.	 We also need to create a custom content model to define our custom 
properties. In this example, we are considering news as one content type, so 
we need to create a custom aspect with the properties of news as:
<aspect name="cignex:news">
  <title>Cignex News</title>
  <properties>
    <property name="cignex:shortTitle">
      <title>Short Title</title>
      <type>d:text</type>
      <index enabled="true"/>
    </property>
        
    <property name="cignex:contentHeader">
      <title>Content Header</title>
      <type>d:text</type>
      <index enabled="true"/>
    </property>
    <property name="cignex:contentSubHeader">
      <title>Content Sub Header</title>
      <type>d:text</type>
      <index enabled="true"/>
    </property>
    <property name="cignex:newsDate">
  <title>News Date</title>
      <type>d:date</type>
      <index enabled="true"/>
    </property>
  </properties>
</aspect>
8.	 Now we can search based on any custom property (metadata). You can add 
search criteria as:
@cignex\:shortTitle:"CignexNews",@cignex\:contentHeader:"Cignex*"
9.	 You can use any of the previously mentioned approaches using Java  
or JavaScript API, among others, to perform the search by providing  
this criteria.

Leveraging Membership and Security Mechanism along with the  
LDAP example
• 
FFMPEG Integration with Alfresco and using DM Business Rules
• 
Copying content from DM to WCM
• 
Using image transformation in WCM
•

Maintaining and upgrading the system is as equally important as implementing it. 
A well-maintained system will give the highest return on investments. This chapter 
provides a high-level overview of administering and maintaining your Alfresco 
implementation. It includes information about backing up your valuable content, 
upgrading your system to newer versions, enabling full audit trail, and setting up a 
multi-tenant system configuration. You will also find general maintenance tips such 
as maintaining log files and periodically updating your admin password.
By the end of this chapter you will have learned how to:
• 
Back up your data on a regular basis for storage and retrieval
• 
Perform general maintenance tasks such as examining log files
• 
Upgrade your Alfresco application to newer versions
• 
Provide Administrator rights
• 
Clean up deployment history
Data backup
This is one of the most important, yet also one of the most neglected, areas 
of computing. Backing up your data should be at the top of your computer 
maintenance list—right next to virus protection. Without data backup, you are 
running the risk of losing your data.
Data loss can happen in many ways. One of the most common causes is the physical 
failure of the media that the data is stored on. In some situations, users of the system 
might have deleted the content due to some error. No matter what, your data is your 
intellectual property and you need to protect it by doing proper backups regularly.

List of items to back up
Alfresco stores the content information in both the database and the filesystem. 
You need to back up both the filesystem and relational database. As a part of the 
implementation, you might have customized Alfresco, and hence you need to back 
up customization files. If you have used an external membership system such as 
Active Directory or OpenLDAP, then you might have to back up the user and group 
data as well.
You can set up automated processes to back up data periodically. On Linux 
operating systems, you can write a cron job to run a back-up script on a regular basis. 
Similarly, all other operating systems support back-up utilities.
Most often, people tend to store the back-up data on the same server. This might 
create issues when the server crashes. Hence, it is recommended to move the back-up 
data on to some other external server to store it.
Now, let's examine various types of data which need to be backed up.
Content stored in filesystem
Typically, the content in the filesystem is stored in your <install_folder>/
alf_data folder as shown in the following screenshot. The folder contentstore 
contains the binary content with all of the versions. The folders lucene-indexes and 
backup‑lucene-indexes contain search information. The folder audit.contentstore 
contains audit trail details:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 12
[ 391 ]
You need to back up the entire folder alf_data and the contents. Most of the 
operating systems provide back-up utilities.
If you are a Windows user, you may use the back-up utility that comes with 
Microsoft Windows XP (it is installed by default with the XP Home version). You 
will find it from the Start menu under All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | 
Backup. When you start it, you are presented with the back-up wizard.
Metadata stored in a relational database
A relational database contains a bunch of tables defined as per the Alfresco schema. 
These tables hold information about users, security, audit, spaces, metadata, rules, 
scripts, and various business processes (jBPM).
Most of the database vendors (commercial or open source) provide utilities to take 
the database dump. Based on the database you have selected during installation 
(MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server), you can use an appropriate utility to take the 
database dump.
The MySQL database provides a utility called mysqldump to back up both the 
database table definitions and contents. It can be used to dump a database or a 
collection of databases for backup or for transferring the data to another SQL server 
(not necessarily a MySQL server). The dump contains SQL statements to create the 
table or populate it, or both.
The following is the command to take database backup in MySQL:
Syntax: mysqldump [options] db_name [tables] [> output_file_name]
An example command is:
> mysqldump alfresco > alfresco_outfile.sql
Customization files
You might be customizing your Alfresco application over a period of time. Typically, 
you might have added or updated the following files:
• 
Logos, images, and stylesheets
• 
JSP files (dashboard)
• 
Presentation templates
• 
Configuration files, property files
• 
Files in the extension folder
• 
Custom application code (WAR file, source Java files, and so on)

[ 392 ]
The process you follow to maintain and back up your customization files depends 
upon the development process you follow within your organization. It is useful to 
maintain your customization files in some configuration management system such as 
CVS or SVN, which helps you to easily maintain and back up.
Membership data
If you have used the Alfresco out-of-the-box membership system, then the data is 
stored in the relational database. You don't have to do any special task to back up the 
data as you are already backing up the relational database tables.
If you have used an external membership system such as Active Directory or 
OpenLDAP to have a single sign-on or centralized identity management system, 
then you must consider backup of your membership data as well.
You will have access to back-up tools based on the membership system you have 
used. Ensure that the data in the external membership system is backed up.
Log files
The location of the log files depend upon the application server. For the Tomcat 
installation, the log files are located at <install_folder> itself. Tomcat application 
server creates a log file per day. The current log file is named alfresco.log and at 
the end of the day, the log file will be backed up as alfresco.log.YYYY-MM-DD (for 
example, alfresco.log.2010-03-25).
Based on the usage of the system and on the logging level, the size of these log files 
might be pretty big. Hence, it is a good practice to back up the older log files and 
remove them from the current location to save hard disk space.
Backup frequency
The frequency at which you take backup really depends upon the nature of the 
application, your high availability requirements, and the Alfresco deployment option 
you have chosen.

[ 393 ]
For example, you can consider only a one-time backup of customization files. 
You can back up the files whenever you enhance the application or upgrade the 
application to newer versions.
Since the content, metadata, and tasks change very frequently, regular backup  
of the Alfresco filesystem and relational database is required. You have to consider 
the business risk and system resources availability while deciding on the  
back-up frequency.
Backup is based on Alfresco deployment
If your application is highly accessed by thousands of users, then it is important for 
you to deploy Alfresco in a clustered environment. If it is a critical application such 
as finance or insurance, then you should consider deploying Alfresco in hot back-up 
mode with master-slave configuration. The data backup policy and process might be 
different based on the way you have deployed Alfresco.
The typical process to back up Alfresco repository is as follows:
1.	 Stop Alfresco to ensure that no one can make changes during the backup.
2.	 Export the MySQL (or other) database.
3.	 Back up the Alfresco alf_data directory.
4.	 Start Alfresco.
To restore Alfresco repository:
1.	 Stop Alfresco.
2.	 Delete the alf_data folder and restore the alf_data folder that you backed 
up earlier.
3.	 Drop the database and import the database that you have exported.
4.	 Start Alfresco.

Alfresco deployed as a Repository Application 
Server
In this deployment (shown in the following figure), the web application becomes 
the host for an embedded repository and remote access is via the application, that is, 
HTTP. This is the default deployment option chosen by the Alfresco installer. This 
means the repository automatically benefits from any enhanced features provided by 
higher-end web application servers. For example, the repository can be embedded 
inside Apache Tomcat for the lightest weight deployment, but also embedded inside 
J2EE-compliant application servers from JBoss, Oracle, or IBM to take advantage of 
distributed transactions, and much more:
In this deployment option, you need to take the backup of the alf_data folder and 
the database. There will be one copy of customization files.
Alfresco deployed as a hot backup
In this deployment, as shown in the following figure, one Repository server is 
designated the master and another completely separate Repository server is 
designated the slave. The live application is hosted on the master, and as it is used, 
synchronous and asynchronous replication updates are made to the slave, that is, the 
backup. The backup remains in read-only mode. If for some reason, the master breaks 
down, it is a relatively simple task to swap over to the slave to continue operation.

In this deployment option, you don't need to take a regular backup as the data is 
getting backed up automatically.
Upgrading to new versions of Alfresco
You can consider upgrading to a new version of Alfresco if you are expecting one of 
the following benefits:
• 
Security patches
• 
Bug fixes
• 
New features
• 
Compatibility with other systems
Even if you are not getting the benefits listed earlier, sometimes you might consider 
upgrading to a newer version, as you do not want to maintain a big gap between 
the Alfresco version on which your application is currently running and the latest 
Alfresco version. If this gap is too big, it might be very expensive for you to upgrade 
later on. This is the scenario with most enterprise software.

Alfresco has upgrade scripts, which helps you to upgrade to newer versions 
automatically. However, it is essential to follow certain best practices while upgrading 
your system. Always try upgrading the test or staging server first before trying on 
production server. It is essential that you back up your existing data before attempting 
an upgrade. Follow the information and instructions given in the Data backup section.
Upgrading to a minor release
An Alfresco minor (or dot) release typically contains bug fixes and minor 
enhancements. There will not be any new features. An example is upgrading from 
Alfresco 3.2 to 3.2.1 release.
Since there are no new features, typically, the database schema remains the same. In 
this situation, you can replace only the web application (WAR) file to upgrade.
The WAR file (alfresco.war) for Tomcat installation is located in the <install_
folder>/tomcat/webapps folder.
Follow these steps for minor upgrades:
1.	 Download the latest alfresco.war file from the Alfresco website.
2.	 Stop Alfresco.
3.	 Back up all of the data including customization files (as explained in the  
earlier sections).
4.	 Delete the web application folder <install_folder>/tomcat/ 
webapps/alfresco.
5.	 Replace the alfresco.war file in the <install_folder>/tomcat/webapps 
folder with the latest one.
6.	 Restore the customization files.
7.	 Start Alfresco. 
Test your application after upgrading it to ensure that the upgrade is successful.
Upgrading to a major release
An Alfresco major release typically contains new features, performance enhancements, 
and bug fixes. An example is upgrading from Alfresco 2.x to 3.x releases.
The upgrade scripts will be executed automatically by the server when starting up 
against an existing database. Scripts that support the various Hibernate dialects 
can be found in the <configRoot>/alfresco/dbscripts/upgrade/* folders. This 
means that you don't have to do manual upgrades any more.

For example, let us assume that you are using the Tomcat bundle of Alfresco 2.1 
(installed in C:\alfresco2.1 folder) on a Microsoft Windows operating system, and 
you want to upgrade to Alfresco 3.3 release.
Follow these steps for major upgrades:
1.	 Stop Alfresco in your current installation folder C:\alfresco2.1.
2.	 Back up all of the data, including customization files (as explained in the 
earlier sections).
3.	 Download the complete Alfresco package, Tomcat bundle for the Microsoft 
Windows operating system.
4.	 Perform a new installation in a different folder (say C:\alfresco3.3).
5.	 Copy the older Alfresco file content folder to the newer installation (copy the 
C:\alfresco2.1\alf_data folder to C:\alfresco3.3\alf_data).
6.	 Create a new database table and restore the relational database content 
from the older database. Update the Alfresco configuration file in the new 
installation to point to this new database.
7.	 Restore the customization files in the new installation.
8.	 Start Alfresco in the new installation.
Though most of the upgrade happens automatically, you might have to perform 
some manual steps to restore your customization files in a new installation.
There are some configuration files and a properties file in Alfresco's config folder  
(/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/), which you might 
have updated, which require manual updates.
While I was writing this book, I upgraded the example application from Alfresco 
2.1 version to Alfresco 3.3 version. I used the following script to restore some of the 
customization files. I manually updated some of the configuration files. Refer to the 
batch file that I used to restore the customization files on the Windows platform.

You can create your own batch scripts to automatically restore your customization 
files. Typically, most of the developers use tools such as Eclipse to build and deploy 
the customization files to the newer installations. 
Test your application after upgrading it to ensure that the upgrade is successful.
Cleaning up deployment history
There are two ways to clean out old deployment reports in WCM:
• 
Using Alfresco Explorer
• 
Using scheduler
Using Alfresco Explorer
Administrator and Content Managers of the web project have the right to delete the 
Deployment Reports. Follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Staging Sandbox area of the web project.
2.	 Click on the Actions menu.

3.	 Click on the Delete All Deploy Reports submenu.
4.	 It will ask for confirmation; click on Yes to delete the reports.
Using scheduler
Using scheduler you can delete the reports older than the given number of days. 
You can configure this scheduler to run on a periodic basis. Follow the next steps to 
configure this scheduler.
1.	 Rename the file deployment-attempt-cleaner-context.xml.sample 
to deployment-attempt-cleaner-context.xml specified at the location 
<alfresco_home>/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension.
2.	 Configure the following highlighted changes:
    <bean id="avmDeploymentAttemptCleaner" 
       class="org.alfresco.repo.avm.AVMDeploymentAttemptCleaner">
        <!-- number of days to keep deployment attempts -->

Deployment report 1 day after
Since we have configured to clean up reports that are one day older, on the next day, 
we can see only those reports which are deployed today. All other reports, which are 
shown in the previous screenshot, have been purged.
General maintenance tips
If you maintain the system regularly by cleaning up the database and fixing the 
system errors, your system runs faster. Some of the tips are given in this section.
Examine log files
Your log files tell you very important issues and problems about your system. The 
level of details logged will be based on the level of logging (INFO, ERROR, and DEBUG).
The log files are named as alfresco.log (current one) or alfresco.log.YYYY-MM-
DD (older ones). Examine one of the log files and you will notice the log entries made 
in the following categories.
• 
ERROR: Error occurred (requires FIX)
• 
WARN: Warning messages (requires your attention)
• 
INFO: General information about the system

The sample messages are given next:
11:20:42,088 WARN  [org.hibernate.cache.EhCacheProvider] Could not 
find configuration [org.jbpm.graph.def.Node]; using defaults.
11:21:45,056 ERROR [org.alfresco.repo.action.ActionServiceImpl] An 
error was encountered whilst executing the action 'import'.
org.alfresco.service.cmr.view.ImporterException: Failed to import 
package at line 8; column 19 due to error: A complete repository 
package cannot be imported here…
15:03:19,308 INFO  [org.alfresco.repo.admin.patch.PatchExecuter] No 
patches were required. .
You have to fix the errors listed in the log file and make sure there are no ERROR 
messages in the log files. There are many utilities (based on the operating system), 
which examine the log file for errors and send you notifications as required. Consider 
using or developing such a tool to be notified as soon as an ERROR occurs.
Reset the administrator password
Administrator has the highest powers in the Alfresco application. It is a good 
practice to periodically change the administrator password as a security process.  
You can change the password using the Alfresco Explorer's user profile option.
You also need to make the change in alfresco-virtserver.properties for the 
new password, as follows:
1.	 Modify value for the alfresco.server.password property in the above 
mentioned file to the new password.
2.	 Restart the server.
Providing administrator rights
By default, only the admin user will have administrator rights. You can provide 
administrator rights to any user using Alfresco Explorer as mentioned next:
1.	 Log into Alfresco as admin user.
2.	 Navigate to the Administrator Console.
3.	 Click on Manage User Groups and click on ALFRESCO_
ADMINISTRATORS group.
4.	 Click on the More Actions menu and select the Add User option.
5.	 Search the users to whom you want to assign administrator rights and click 
on Add.

Chapter 12
[ 403 ]
6.	 You can see those users added in the group as shown in the  
following screenshot:
Now these users will also have the Administrator rights and can perform all 
administrative tasks from Alfresco Explorer.
Reset complete repository data
If you are setting up an environment to test your Alfresco application, you might 
want to remove or reset the data once the testing is done. There might be other 
circumstances when you want to remove the existing users, spaces, and rules from 
the repository, and start fresh. Before deleting or resetting the complete repository, 
you might want to back it up.
Following is the process to reset the complete repository data:
1.	 Stop Alfresco.
2.	 Remove the alf_data folder.
3.	 Drop the Alfresco database and create an empty Alfresco database.
4.	 Start Alfresco.
When you start Alfresco, the alf_data folder will be created and the default 
database tables will be created automatically.
Migrating servers
The process of migrating an instance of Alfresco running on one server to another 
server follows a similar pattern to the back-up process, with additional steps of 
ensuring any configuration is also copied over.

Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, 
giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, 
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For 
more information, please visit our website: www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order to 
continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand, home 
to books published on software built around Open Source licences, and offering information 
to anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open Source brand 
also runs Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty to each Open 
Source project about whose software a book is sold.
