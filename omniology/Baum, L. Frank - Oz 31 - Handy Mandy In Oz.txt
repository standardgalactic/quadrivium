 CHAPTER 1

 MANDY LEAVES THE MOUNTAIN
 "What-a-Butter! What-a-Butter!" High and clear above the peaks ofMt.Mern
  floated the voice of the Goat Girl calling the finest, fattest, but most
  troublesome of her flock. All the other goats were winding obediently down
  toward the village that perched precariously on the edge of the mountain.
  But of What-a-Butter there was not a single sign or whisker.
 "Serves me right for spoiling the contrary creature," panted Mandy, pushing
  back her thick, yellow braids with her second-best hand. "Always wants her
  own way, that goat, so she does. What-a-Butter, I say WHAT-A-BUTTER, come
  down here this instant." But only the tantalizing tinkle of the goat's
  silver bell came to answer her, for What-a-Butter was climbing up, not
  down, and there was nothing for Mandy to do but go after her.
 Muttering dire threats which she was much too soft-hearted ever to carry
  out, the rosy-cheeked mountain lass scrambled over crags and stones,
  pulling herself up steep precipices, the goat always managing to keep a few
  jumps ahead, till soon they were almost at the top of the mountain!
 Here, stepping on a jutting rock to catch her breath and remove the burrs
  from her stockings, Mandy heard a dreadful roar and felt an ominous
  rumbling beneath her feet. What-a-Butter, on a narrow ledge just above,
  heard it too and cocked her head anxiously on one side. Perhaps she had
  best jump down to Mandy. After all, the great silly girl did feed and pet
  her, and from the sound of things a storm was brewing. If there was one
  thing the goat feared more than another, it was a thunderstorm, so, rolling
  her eyes as innocently as if she had not dragged Mandy all over the
  mountain, she stretched her nose down toward her weary mistress.
 "BahC4ah-ah-ahhhhhhhhhh!" bleated What-a-Butter affectionately.

 "Oh, `Bah' yourself!" fumed Mandy, making an angry snatch for the Nanny
  Goat's beard. "Pets and children are all alike, never appreciate a body
  till they have a stomach ache or a thunderstorm is coming. Now then,
  m'lass, be quick with you!"
 Holding out her strong arms, Mandy made ready to catch the goat as it jumped
  off the ledge. But before What-a-Butter could stir, there was a perfectly
  awful crash and explosion and up shot the slab of rock on which Mandy was
  standing, up, UP, and out of sight entirely. Where the mountain girl had
  been a crystal column of water spurted viciously into the air, so high the
  bulging eyes of the goat could see no end to it. Rearing up on her hind
  legs, What-a-Butter turned round and round in a frantic effort to catch a
  glimpse of her vanishing Mistress. Then, thinking suddenly what would
  happen should the torrent turn and fall upon her, the goat sprang off the
  ledge and ran madly down the mountain, bleating like a whole herd of
  Banshees.
 And Mandy, as you can well believe, was as frightened as What-a-Butter and
  with twice as much reason. The first upheaval, as the rock left the earth,
  flung her flat on her nose. Grasping the edges of the slab with all hands,
  Mandy hung on for dear life and, as a stinging shower of icy water sprayed
  her from head to foot, wondered what under the earth was happening to her.
  Thorns and thistles! Could the thunderstorm really have come UP instead of
  down? Certainly it was raining up, and whatever was carrying her aloft with
  such terrible force and relentlessness?
 How could the Goat Girl know that a turbulent spring pent up for thousands
  of years in the center ofMt.Mernhad suddenly burst its way to freedom?

  And you have no idea of the tremendous power in a mountain spring once it
  uncoils and lets itself go. Mandy's rock might just as well have been shot
  into the air by a magic cannon. First it tore upward as if it meant to
  knock a hole in the sky, then, still traveling at incalculable speed, began
  to arch and take a horizontal course over the mountains, hills and valleys
  west of Mern. All poor Mandy knew was that she was hurtling through space
  at breakneck speed with nothing to save or stop her. The long, yellow
  braids of the Goat Girl streamed out like pennants, while her striped skirt
  and voluminous petticoats snapped and fluttered like banners in the wind.
 "What-a-Butter! Oh, What-a-Butter!" moaned Mandy, gazing wildly over the
  edge of the rock. But pshaw, what was the use of calling? What-a-Butter,
  even if she heard, could not fly after her through the air, and when she
  herself came down, not even her own goat would recognize her. At this
  depressing thought Mandy dropped her head on her arms and began to weep
  bitterly, for she was quite sure she would never see her friends, her home,
  or her goats again.
 But the strength and frugal life onMt.Mernhad made the Goat Girl both
  brave and resourceful, so she soon dried her tears, and as the rock still
  showed no signs of slowing up or dashing down, she began to take heart and
  even a desperate sort of interest in her experience. Slowly and cautiously,
  she pulled herself to a sitting position and, still clutching the edges of
  the rock, dared to look down at the countries and towns flashing away
  below.
 "After all," sniffed the reckless maiden, "nothing very dreadful has
  happened yet. I've always wanted to travel, and now I AM traveling. Not
  many people have flown through the air on a rock C4 why, it's really a

  rocket!" decided Mandy with a nervous giggle. "And that, I suppose, makes
  me the first rocket-rider in the country, and the LAST, too," she finished
  soberly as she measured with her eye the distance she would plunge when her
  rock started earthward. "Now if we'd just come down in that blue lake
  below, I might have a chance. Perhaps I should jump." But by the time Mandy
  made up her mind to jump, the lake was far behind, and nothing but a great
  desert of smoking sand stretched beneath her.
  
 CHAPTER 2
 THE END OF THE RIDE
 The sky, from the rosy pink of late afternoon had faded to a depressing
  grey, and Mandy could not help thinking longingly of the appetizing little
  supper she had set out for herself before going up to call the goats. Who
  would eat it now or even know she was flying through the air like a comet?
  No one, she concluded drearily, for Mandy was an orphan and lived all by
  herself in a small cottage onMt.Mern, high above the village of
  Fistikins. In a day or two some of her friends in the village might search
  the cottage and find her gone, but NOW, now there was nothing to do but sit
  tight and hope for the best.
 Mandy's next glance down was more encouraging. Instead of the
  dangerous-looking desert, she was sailing over misty blue hills and valleys
  dotted with many small towns and villages. High as she was, she could even
  hear the church bells tolling the hour, and this made Mandy feel more lost
  and lonely than ever. All these people below were safely at home and about
  to eat their suppers, while she was flying high and far from everything she

  knew and loved best.
 Hungrily, the Goat Girl cast her eyes over the rock she was riding, thinking
  to find a small sprig of mountain berries or even a blade of grass to
  nibble. At first glance, the rock seemed bare and barren, then, sticking up
  out of a narrow crevice, Mandy spied a tiny blue flower. "Poor little posy,
  it's as far from home as I am," murmured the Goat Girl, and carefully
  breaking the stem she lifted the blue flower to her nose. Its faint
  fragrance was vaguely comforting, and Mandy had just begun to count the
  petals when the rock gave a sickening lurch and started to pitch down so
  fast Mandy's braids snapped like jumping ropes and her skirts bellied out
  like a parachute in a gale.
 "NOW for it," gasped the Goat Girl, closing her eyes and clenching her
  teeth. "OH! My poor little shins!" Mandy's shins were both stout and
  sturdy, but even so we cannot blame Mandy for pitying them. Stouter shins
  than hers would have splintered at such a fall. Hardly knowing what she was
  doing, Mandy began to pull the petals from the blue flower, calling in an
  agonized voice as she pulled each one the names of her goats and friends.
  She had just come to Speckle, the smallest member of her flock, when the
  end came.
 Kimmeny Jimmeny! Was this ALL? Opening one eye, the Goat Girl looked
  fearfully about her. She was sitting on top of a haystack; no, not a
  haystack, but a heap of soft blue flower petals as soft as down. Opening
  the other eye, she saw the rock on which she had traveled so far bump over
  a golden fence and fall with a satisfied splash into a shimmering lake. But
  what lay beyond the lake made Mandy forget all her troubles and fairly moan
  with surprise and pleasure.

 "A CASTLE!" exulted the Goat Girl, putting one hand above her heart. "Oh!
  I've always wanted to see a castle, and now I AM." And this castle, let me
  tell you, was well worth anyone's seeing, a castle of lacy blue marble
  carved, and decorated with precious stones in a way to astonish the eyes of
  a simple mountain lass. From the tallest tower a silken pennant floated
  lazily in the evening breeze.
 "K-E-R-E-T-A-R-I-A," Mandy spelled out slowly. Sliding off the heap of
  flower petals, she stood for a long, delicious moment lost in admiration.
  Then, giving herself a businesslike shake to be sure she was not broken or
  bent by her amazing flight and tumble, Mandy turned to examine the rest of
  her surroundings. When she looked at the spot on which she had fallen, the
  stack of blue petals had disappeared, but there, twinkling up cheerfully,
  was the blue flower as much at home as if it had grown there in the first
  place. Thoroughly puzzled, Mandy picked the little flower a second time and
  slipped it into the pocket of her apron.
 Even without the mystery of the blue flower, it was astonishing enough to
  find herself in the stately park of this gorgeous blue castle. There was a
  tree-lined avenue, and velvety lawns splashed with star-shaped flower beds
  stretched in every direction. Only the small patch of land on which she was
  standing was bare and uncultivated. And evidently someone was at work here,
  for a great white ox with golden horns, yoked to a gold plow, stood with
  his back to Mandy, dozing cozily in the pleasant dusk. At sight of the ox,
  Mandy gave a little sigh of relief and content. Long ago an old mountain
  woman had given her this sensible piece of advice. "When you do not know
  what to do next, do the first useful piece of work that comes to hand." Now

  here, right at hand, was a useful piece of work, and while she was trying
  to figure out the whole puzzle of the flying rock and strange blue flower,
  she might just as well be plowing. Then when the owner of the castle saw
  her working so industriously, he might invite her to supper. So, grasping
  the tail of the ancient plow, Mandy clicked her tongue in a cheerful signal
  for the ox to start.
 The white ox, who had not seen or heard the Goat Girl till this minute,
  turned his head in a lordly fashion and gave her a long, haughty look. Not
  really believing what he saw, he took another look, and then, with a bellow
  of fright and outrage, went charging across the park, pulling the startled
  Goat Girl behind him. Mandy might have let go, but she just did not think
  of it, and with pounding heart and flying braids held fast to the pitching
  plow as it tore through flower beds, ripped up lawns, and cut fearful
  furrows in the pebbled paths. Clouds of earth, stones and whole plants
  uprooted ruthlessly from their beds showered round her ears, and as they
  reached the palace, a hard metal object hit her squarely between the eyes.
  Putting up a hand, Mandy caught the flying missile and mechanically slipped
  it into her pocket, and the next instant the ox, lunging through an open
  French window, dragged her into the magnificently furnished throne room of
  the castle. Not only into the throne room, mind you, but into the lap of
  royalty itself!
  
 CHAPTER 3
 THE KING OF KERETERIA
 The white ox in his mad dash across the throne room had run violently into a
  marble pillar, hurling Mandy straight into the arms of a very tall, very

  stern, and very blue-looking monarch. Pages and courtiers tripped and fell
  left and right in a scramble to get out of the way, while the ox, snorting
  and trembling, looked balefully over his shoulder at the Goat Girl.
 "Whu-what is the meaning of this outrageous intrusion?" panted the King.
  "Unhand me, woman! Remove your finger from my eye and your arms C4 your
  ARMS! Hi! Hi! Hi!" The King's sentence ended in three frightened squeaks.
  "Is it a girl or an octopus?" he puffed, heaving up his chest in an
  endeavor to dislodge Mandy. "Hi! Hi! Hi! Are you going to allow this
  clumping savage to insult my Majesty in this C4 er C4 high-handed
  manner?"
 As the Goat Girl, by this time scarlet from anger and mortification, jumped
  off the King's lap, three very high officials of the Court of Keretaria
  darted forward. "The High Qui-questioner! The Imperial Persuader! And the
  Lord High Upper Dupper of the Realm!" bawled a page. Having delivered
  himself of this impressive announcement, the page bolted back of a curtain
  and from there peered with astonished eyes at the visitor. Everyone in the
  grand blue throne room looked frightened and ready to run at a moment's
  notice. Wondering what could be the matter with them all, Mandy with many
  misgivings watched the counselors of Keretaria advance in a threatening
  row.
 "Now then, not a move!" thundered the High Qui-questioner, tapping her
  sharply on the shoulder with a golden staff shaped like a huge
  interrogation point. "It is my duty to question all strangers who ride,
  fall, fly or break into our Kingdom, and you," the Haughty Nobleman gave
  Mandy a cold blue stare, "YOU are stranger than any stranger who has ever

  come to Keretaria."
 "It is my duty to persuade you to do as his Majesty commands," stated the
  Imperial Persuader, raising his gold spiked club.
 "And it is MY duty to put you in your place," sniffed the Lord High Upper
  Dupper, rattling a bunch of keys that hung from his belt.
 "Well, if you ask me," puffed the Ox, rolling his eyes wildly round at the
  Goat Girl, "her place is in a museum, and the sooner you lock her upper
  dupper, the better." Now Mandy was so astonished to hear the Ox actually
  speaking, she gave a loud cry and flung up her hands, every single seven of
  them.
 "Help! Help!" yelped the Courtiers, scurrying like mice into corners and
  corridors. Only the white Ox, the King and his Counselors kept their
  places.
 "How DARE you come into a King's presence armed in this barbarous fashion!"
  gasped the High Qui-questioner, taking a step toward the Goat Girl, but too
  frightened to touch her.
 "PIGS!" cried Mandy, suddenly losing her temper. "Can I help my seven arms?
  All of us on Mt. Mern have seven arms and hands, and you with your skinny
  two seem far funnier than I. I am Mandy, the Goat Girl, as anyone in his
  senses can see."
 "The girl is right," observed the Ox, gazing more attentively at Mandy and
  now speaking quite calmly. "She can no more help those seven arms than you
  can help those seven warts on your nose, Questo. I tell you this maiden is
  a real curiosity, and if you three Hi-boys will cease rattling your teeth
  and your clubs, perhaps she will explain why she has come to Keretaria. I
  myself shall call her Handy Mandy."

 "Why, the beast has more sense than its masters," thought the Goat Girl in
  surprise.
 "Well," rumbled the King ungraciously, "if you have anything to say before
  we lock you up, SAY IT, but do not wave your arms about, PLEASE."
 Swallowing nervously, clasping four of her hands behind her back and
  stuffing the other three into convenient pockets in her apron, Mandy began
  to speak. "I was driving my goats home from the mountain, Your Majesty,
  when the rock on which I was standing exploded suddenly into the air, flew
  like a bird over hill, valley, and desert, and dropped me into your
  gardenFF20C4"
 "And not a bruise or a bump to show for it," grunted the Imperial Persuader,
  elevating his nose to show he was not taken in by such a tale. In spite of
  his suspicious glance, Mandy decided to say nothing of the blue flower that
  had so miraculously softened her fall.
 "And since when have rocks flown through the air?" inquired the Lord High
  Upper Dupper sarcastically.
 "Ahem C4 in the garden," continued Mandy, undaunted by the two
  interruptions, "I saw this great white ox, and thinking to do a bit of
  honest work for my supper grasped the plow, butFF20C4"
 "That was a little oxident," murmured the great beast in a jovial voice,
  "for, catching sight of a seven-armed maiden all at once and without
  warning, I took to my heels and landed her in her present unpleasant
  predicament. Is that not so, m'lass?"
 Looking at the Ox with round eyes, Mandy nodded.
 "But she still has not explained all these arms," complained the Imperial

  Persuader. "Whoever heard of a seven-handed maiden?"
 "I have!" asserted Mandy stoutly. "And what, pray, is there to explain? This
  iron hand C4" the Goat Girl raised it slowly and thoughtfully as she spoke
  "C4 I use for ironing, lifting hot pots from the stove, and all horrid
  sort of hard work; this leather hand I keep for beating rugs, dusting,
  sweeping, and so on; this wooden hand I use for churning and digging in the
  garden; these two red rubber hands for dishwashing and scrubbing; and my
  two fine white hands I keep for holding and braiding my hair." With all
  seven hands extended before her, Mandy smiled engagingly up at the King.
 "Undoubtedly a witch," whispered the Imperial Persuader darkly as the King,
  in spite of himself, gazed curiously down at his seven-armed visitor.
 "A dangerous character, Your Majesty," hissed the High Qui-questioner,
  shaking his head disapprovingly.
 "To the dungeons with her!" rasped the Lord High Upper Dupper, rattling his
  keys like castanets.
 "WHAT?" bawled the white Ox, stamping all of his gold-shod feet in rapid
  succession. "You mean to consign this marvel of skill and efficiency to a
  dungeon? What a set of dunces you are! Come, Handy, I myself will take you
  for a slave. Out of my way, DOLTS!" Swaggering a bit and with the golden
  plow still clanking and bumping behind him, the Ox ambled at a dignified
  pace toward the door. Mandy, though she did not relish the idea of becoming
  his slave, was greatly relieved at the interest the Ox was taking in her
  case, but before following him she looked inquiringly up at the King.
 "Yes, GO!" commanded His Majesty harshly. "I hereby give you into the care
  and service of Nox, the Royal Ox of Keretaria. Harm one hair of his head
  and you will pay for it with your life and perish, I promise you, most

  ignominiously."
 "MercyC4ercy," muttered Mandy, tiptoeing nervously after her new master,
  "doesn't the fellow know any short words? How queer everything is on this
  side of the mountain: people with only two arms, animals talking and giving
  orders to Kings. Suppose the goats at home started bossing the villagers?"
  And what would the villagers think of her strange flight and reception in
  Keretaria? Well, from what she herself had seen of Royalty, decided the
  Goat Girl, she much preferred her goats or even the company of this haughty
  white Ox. Stepping briskly beside him, Mandy resolved to humor the creature
  till she saw a bit more of the country or found some safe way back to her
  mountain. Nox, swinging along at his own indolent gait, paid no further
  attention to the Goat Girl, but when they reached his royal quarters, which
  to Mandy looked more like a castle than a stable, he began bawling so
  fiercely for the stable boys she decided uncomfortably that being his slave
  might prove both unpleasant and dangerous. However, when six little boys
  dressed in blue overalls and aprons ran out, the royal Ox addressed them
  quite kindly. The first, without waiting for instructions, unhitched the
  plow and lifted the yoke from the royal shoulders.
 "Prepare Kerry's quarters for my new slave," directed Nox, turning to the
  second and third.20"You others, bring dinner for two, and mind you fetch
  Handy Mandy everything they have at the King's table." With a playful
  lunge, Nox started them smartly on their way, then moved grandly into the
  huge stone stable and along to his own luxurious gold-paved stall.
 "MyC4y!" exclaimed the Goat Girl, sinking breathlessly to a three-legged
  stool, "How grand and elegant you are here! MyC4y, I wish What-a-Butter

  could see this!"
 "One of your goats?" murmured Nox, burying his nose in the huge marble bowl
  he used for a drinking trough.
 Mandy nodded. "I wish she were here now!" she added with a rapturous little
  sigh.
 "Well, I don't." Deliberately, the Royal Ox licked the water from his lips.
  "Do you suppose I'd allow a miserable goat in my sapphire-trimmed stall?"
 "Miserable!" squealed Mandy, springing off the stool. "What-a-Butter's the
  smartest goat on the mountain; she wouldn't give two bleats and a BAH for
  an old Hoopadoop like YOU!"
 "Hoopadoop!" repeated the Ox in a dazed whisper. "Do you mean to stand there
  and call the Royal Ox of Keretaria a Hoopadoop?"
 "Yes," said Mandy firmly, but backing off a bit as she spoke. "What makes
  you think you're so much better than a goat, even if you do talk, put on
  airs, and have golden horns?"
 "Well," and to Mandy's surprise and relief, Nox cleared his throat and
  grinned quite amiably, "after all, I AM the Royal Ox, you know, more
  precious to the King than all his court and subjects. Everyone jumps at my
  least command, so why shouldn't I put on a few airs? Besides, do you think
  it's polite to call me an old Hoopadoop when I've just saved you from a
  dungeon?"
 "No," admitted Mandy, resuming her seat thoughtfully, "I don't suppose it
  is. Maybe you $$are&& as good as a goat," she added with a little burst of
  generosity.
 "Oh, thank you! Thank you very much!" Through half-closed eyes, the Royal Ox
  looked quizzically at the Goat Girl. "I believe we shall get on famously,

  m'lass, famously. The truth is, you amuse me no end, and so long as you
  amuse me, everything will be smooth as silk. But of course, if you bore me,
  I will bore you. Oh, positively!" Lowering his head, Nox shook his horns
  playfully.
 "Now, I shouldn't try that, if I were you," advised Mandy, raising her iron
  hand and cracking the fingers warningly. "For if you do, I might throw
  things!"
 "Ha ha! I believe you would." The enormous beast, charmed by so much spirit
  and independence, fairly beamed upon his new slave. "I take it you are
  pretty good at throwing things."
 "Yes, and at catching them, too." Reaching up, Mandy took seven of the dozen
  brushes off the shelf above her head. Tossing them all into the air with
  three of her hands, she caught them easily with the other four. Then,
  dragging her stool closer, she began brushing the coat of her royal charge
  so hard and vigorously he blinked with pleasure and astonishment. "Will you
  have your tail plain, curled, or plaited?" asked Mandy in a businesslike
  voice.
 "ErC4erC4plain, thank you." With admiration and some alarm, Nox regarded
  the whirling arms of the Goat Girl, but the four little stable boys,
  appearing at that moment, stared at her in glassy-eyed fright and
  consternation. For Nox they had brought a tray heaped high with corn and
  oats and another with fresh sliced apples. For Mandy there were two trays
  of gold dishes containing a sample of everything from the royal table.
  Dropping her brushes, Mandy seized all the trays at once in her various
  hands, which so frightened the stable boys they took to their heels yelling

  at the tops of their voices.
 Winking at the Royal Ox, Mandy set his supper on the gold stand meant for
  that purpose, then, dropping to the floor before her own two trays, began
  her first dinner in a strange land. And WHAT a strange land, mused Mandy,
  helping herself from the gold dishes with first one hand and then another.
 "Well, m'lass?" inquired Nox, daintily nibbling his oats and apples. "Is
  this not better than bread and water in a dungeon cell?" Too full for
  utterance, Mandy rapturously nodded.
  
 CHAPTER 4
 THE MESSAGE IN THE HORN
 After the Goat Girl had finished her supper and the stable boys had hurried
  off with the trays, Nox showed his new slave to her quarters. Handy Mandy,
  who had expected nothing better than a heap of straw in the corner of an
  empty stall, decided that for a slave she was faring pretty well. A small
  but complete apartment had been built in the wing next to Nox's stall, with
  not only a comfortable bedroom and bath, but a small sitting room as well.
  The bed was a huge, gold four-poster with blue silk sheets and comforters.
  Never in her hard and simple life had Handy dreamed of such elegance!
 "Here, try the chairs," urged Nox, trotting almost briskly into the sitting
  room. This Mandy was only too willing to do, and the pretty little room
  with its bookshelves, lamps and pictures seemed to the honest Goat Girl
  much more desirable than the palace.
 "All belonged to Kerry," mumbled the royal Ox, settling himself largely on a
  white rug beside her.
 "Was Kerry one of your slaves?" asked Mandy, rocking herself cheerfully to

  and fro with all her hands resting quietly in her lap.
 "SLAVE!" The Ox spoke sharply. "I should say not. Kerry was a King! Our own
  little King up to a few years ago, and what a lad he was C4 what a lad!"
 "Was?" exclaimed Mandy. "Why, what happened to him?"
 "He disappeared," Nox told her sadly. "Nobody knows how or where; just
  disappeared, my girl, on a hunting trip, and this blue-nosed scoundrel who
  claims to be his uncle came to rule over Keretaria. Since then," Nox
  lowered his voice cautiously, "everything is different C4 and changed. The
  people are treated no better than dogs. DOGS!" repeated the Royal Ox
  bitterly. "Of course, this fellow cannot interfere with me or take any
  chances, for there is a prophecy on the west wall of the castle that has
  stood for a thousand years."
 "What does it say?" asked Mandy, leaning forward and clasping the arms of
  the rocker with all hands.
 Impressively, Nox repeated the prophecy: "So long as the Royal Ox of
  Keretaria is in good health and spirits, so long and no longer shall the
  present King rule over the Land."
 "But who wrote it?" Mandy's rocker stopped with a surprised squeak.
 "Nobody knows," answered Nox soberly, "but it has come true dozens and
  dozens of times. Each time a new King is crowned in Keretaria, a new Ox
  appears mysteriously at the Royal coronation. If anything happens to the
  Royal Ox, the King also is destroyed!"
 "MyC4y!" The Goat Girl now rocked very fast indeed. "So that's the reason
  they take such good care of you, old Toggins. But tell me, where do all of
  you Royal Oxen come from in the first place? And how is it you can speak?

  None of the beasts on Mount Mern can say a word."
 "Oh, thatFF20C4" the Royal Ox lifted his head lazily. "Keretaria is in the
  wonderful Land of Oz, my dear Handy, and all Oz creatures can talk, even
  the mice and squirrels. But what part of Oz we white oxen really come from
  I myself cannot say. I seem to remember a great blue forest and many happy
  days there. Then one evening a silver cloth was thrown over my head, and I
  fell into a deep and immediate slumber. When I awakened, I was here in
  Keretaria, and on that same day little King Kerry was crowned King of the
  Realm. From the attendants and courtiers I learned of the strange prophecy,
  but the young boy King was so devoted to me C4 and I to him C4 I did not
  miss the forest or my former freedom. To be near me, Kerry had this
  apartment built in the stable and spent more than half of his time in my
  company. My life being easy and pleasant, I gave little thought to the past
  or to the future, but spent all my energies enjoying the present. Once in a
  while, just for the looks of the thing, I appeared in Royal Processions,
  and each day at sundown I was yoked for an hour to the golden plow and
  required to stand for an hour in the royal garden. But I never did any real
  work or plowing till you, my reckless Handy, came along today."
 "But what about the little King?" begged the Goat Girl as Nox lapsed into a
  thoughtful silence and seemed to have forgotten all about her.
 "He disappeared, just as I told you." The Royal Ox rolled his big eyes
  mournfully upward. "On this day, as on many others, I carried him on my
  back to the edge of the wood. There, mounting his favorite steed, he rode
  away with the Royal Huntsmen for an hour's sport. As I was returning to the
  castle, someone struck me a terrific blow that felled me to the earth,
  where I lay for several hours in complete unconsciousness. Whoever struck

  me down evidently thought I was finished, for when I finally did regain my
  senses, I was buried beneath a heap of loose earth and leaves. Still dazed
  and hardly knowing what I was about, I struggled out and staggered back to
  the courtyard. One of my horns had been bent during the encounter, and my
  expression was so wild and distracted that no one recognized me as BOZ, the
  Royal Ox of little King Kerry. The whole castle was in an uproar, for a new
  King had taken possession of the throne, and thinking, of course, I was the
  next and new Royal Ox, this rascally imposter named me NOX. The
  Keretarians, without daring to inquire what had become of their former
  ruler, crowned me with daisies and laurel and hurried to do the bidding of
  their new ruler."
 "WHY C4 the big $$cowards!&&" said Handy Mandy, clenching all of her fists.
  "And do you mean to tell me nothing has been heard of the little King since
  then?"
 "Nothing." The Royal Ox moved his head drearily from side to side. "The
  people think the Royal Prophecy has been fulfilled again, and what can they
  DO? A farmer's boy brought word that Boz, the Royal Ox, had been struck
  down and spirited away, so naturally they felt sure that Kerry also had
  been destroyed or taken prisoner."
 "Then no one suspects you are really Boz and not NOX?" questioned the Goat
  Girl, now on the very edge of her chair. "Oh, myC4y, but don't you see, if
  you are still the same Ox who came to Keretaria with King Kerry and you are
  still all right, he must be all right, too. That is, if the prophecy means
  $$anything&&."
 "ShC4hh!" warned Nox, looking about nervously. "Someone might hear you.

  That is what keeps me here," he went on seriously. "I felt if I stayed
  quietly in my place, Kerry would some day return, claim his own throne, and
  drive this miserable tyrant out of the country."
 "Stay quietly here when the little fellow may be needing you!" cried Handy
  aghast. "Oh, why don't you go look for him, you great big OX, you? Come on,
  what are we waiting for? Why, I'll drag that old rascal off the throne with
  my own hands," promised the Goat Girl, indignantly waving her arms.
 "Wait! Stop!" Nox sprang up with surprising lightness for one usually so
  ponderous and slow. "Do you realize that I am treasured and watched more
  closely than the crown jewels? At this very moment, twenty guardsmen stalk
  round and round the stable. I have as much chance of leaving Keretaria as a
  goldfish has of flying through a forest."
 As if to prove his words, a tall soldier in a blue shako thrust his head
  suddenly through the window from the outside. "Is everything in order and
  as you wish, your Highness?" puffed the Guard, looking suspiciously at the
  Goat Girl's revolving arms.
 "Everything is lovely," murmured the Ox in a sleepy voice. "My slave here is
  doing her exercises, and when she finishes she will polish my horns." At
  his warning wink, Handy Mandy dropped all her arms at her side.
 "Well! Well! A pleasant evening to you," mumbled the soldier, withdrawing
  his head after another disapproving look at the Goat Girl. For a moment
  after he had disappeared, neither spoke, then Handy Mandy, snatching a silk
  cover from one of the pillows, fell to polishing Nox's left horn for very
  dear life.
 "I can always think faster when I'm working," she observed earnestly.
 "Think away," replied the Ox, closing his eyes so as not to see the numerous

  hands flashing past his nose. "But be careful what you say and do. If you
  rouse the suspicions of old King Kerr, you'll be flung into a dungeon in
  spite of all my influence."
 "Now don't you be worrying about me," chortled Handy with a little wink and
  nod. "I've been taking care of myself and a flock of goats for ten years!
  Say, this $$is&& a bend, for sure." The Goat Girl ran her rubber fingers
  curiously along the curve in the Ox's left horn, and then, with one of her
  sudden and kind-hearted impulses, tried to straighten the quirk with a
  quick twist of her wrist. Imagine, then, if you can, her horror and
  surprise when the golden horn came off in her hand. "Oh, my goats and my
  goodness!" shuddered Handy, hopping from one foot to the other. "What'll I
  do? Where's some glue? Oh MyC4ighC4igh! I'm mighty sorry!"
 "Sorry!" gulped the Royal Ox, glaring at the Goat Girl with rolling eyes and
  lashing tail. But before he could lunge forward, as he certainly intended
  to do, Handy gave a little scream of excitement. "Oh look," she panted,
  pointing all thirty-five fingers at the base of Nox's horn. "Oh, my
  dearC4ear, it screws on. There are regular grooves. Wait, I'll have it
  back in a jiffy."
 Nox, who couldn't possibly see the top of his own head, merely gave a grunt,
  but Handy Mandy, lifting the horn in her wooden hand, screamed again and
  then began to shake the horn violently. At her second shake, two silver
  balls tumbled out and rolled away into a corner. Scrambling after them,
  with Nox now as interested as she, the Goat Girl recovered them both and
  dropped breathlessly on a sofa. On closer examination, Handy discovered the
  balls would open as easily as cardboard Easter eggs, and with Nox's head

  resting heavily on her shoulder, she gave the first a quick turn. It came
  apart at once, and in the hollow center lay a small folded paper. Spreading
  it out on her knees, Handy read in a hoarse whisper: "Go to the Silver
  Mountain of OZ."
 "Silver Mountain? Do you know where that is?" exclaimed the Goat Girl,
  looking wildly round at Nox.
 "No, but I'll wager my head it has something to do with Kerry! Quick,
  m'lass, open the other ball."
 With the trembling fingers of her good white hand, the Goat Girl obeyed.
  Inside the second sphere lay a small silver key. After they had examined
  this and read the message all over again, Handy carefully tucked the two
  articles back in the silver balls and returned the balls to the golden
  horn. Then, hastily screwing the horn back on its base, the two began
  whispering earnestly together. "Mean to say you never knew your horn came
  off?" questioned Handy, clasping and unclasping her hands. "Mean to say you
  never heard of this Silver Mountain?"
 "No, to both questions," answered the Ox with an anxious little sigh. "But
  now that we $$do&& know, we must start off at once to search for it and see
  for ourselves whether Kerry is imprisoned there by his enemies. Though how
  we'll escape these guards or ever get away with half the Kingdom watching I
  cannot imagine!"
 "Never fear, we'll manage," promised Handy easily. "Why, with your horns and
  my hands it will take an army to stop us. Now get your rest, Ox dear, and
  in the morn's morning we'll be journeying."
 "You're right," breathed the Ox, starting obediently toward his stall. "I
  more than half believe you."

 "Good night, then," called the Goat Girl softly. "Don't talk in your sleep
  and give our plans away!"
  
 CHAPTER 5
 OUT OF KERETARIA!
 Nox was asleep on a heap of white flower petals in the corner of his stall,
  asleep and dreaming of the Silver Mountain of Oz, when a sharp tap on the
  shoulder rudely awakened him.
 "Come!" whispered an urgent voice. "Time to start! Come, I've managed
  everything." Lurching to his feet and still in a daze, the Royal Ox looked
  askance and with no great favor at the Goat Girl.
 "Why, it's not even light!" he moaned feebly.
 "Of course not," admitted Handy Mandy guardedly, "but I poked my nose out
  the door a moment ago and saw all the guards were a bit drowsyish, so I
  tapped them on the head with this." Handy Mandy raised her iron hand and
  with a little grimace beckoned Nox to hurry. "Come along now, and we can be
  out of here before they know what's what or who."
 So Nox, with a regretful look round his comfortable stall and a sigh for his
  morning bath and breakfast, moved quietly after her. While the Royal
  Creature had spent most of his time during the past two years thinking of
  ways to rescue his young Master, now that he was actually starting out, he
  was filled with doubt and dismay. How could they ever find this Silver
  Mountain and overcome the enemies that most certainly would beset them? The
  sight of the twenty guards lying in a stiff row somewhat reassured the
  downhearted beast, and in the dim light of early morning he looked

  thoughtfully up at the sturdy mountain lass stepping so resolutely beside
  him. In each hand Handy carried a different weapon, and resting on her
  broad shoulders were a rake, an axe, one guard's gun, another guard's
  sword, a spade, and a long-handled broom. Noting his astonished glance, the
  Goat Girl grinned and with her one free hand touched her fingers to her
  lips. So silently and without exchanging a word the two crossed the stable
  yard, the Royal Park, hurried through a little wood, and came out on a
  dusty blue Highway.
 "NOW!" said Handy, looking up and down the road to make sure no one was
  coming, "Now we can talk and decide which direction to take."
 "How can we do that," objected Nox, panting a little from the unaccustomed
  exertion before breakfast, "when neither of us knows where this Silver
  Mountain is?"
 "Well, we have tongues, haven't we? And can ask, can't we?" Handy Mandy
  rattled her weapons impatiently. "But before we worry about the Silver
  Mountain, we must get out of Keretaria. Which is the quickest way to the
  border?"
 "Oh, North," answered Nox promptly. "Keretaria is in the upper part of the
  Munchkin Country of Oz, and once we cross the Northern branch of the
  Munchkin River, we'll be entirely out of the country."
 "Fine! Then we'll go North. And what lies beyond the Munchkin River?"
  inquired the Goat Girl, shifting the axe to her left shoulder.
 "I've never crossed, myself," admitted Nox, moving along in his slow and
  dignified manner, "but I have heard there many purple mountains, and if we
  go far enough the Purple Land of the Gillikens."
 "Sounds interesting," decided Handy Mandy, "and who knows, among all those

  mountains we may find the one we are looking for! By the way, am I to call
  you Boz, Nox, or Goldie Horns? But I believe I'll call you Nox, for somehow
  I like Nox the Ox best."
 "Anything you say," yawned her companion, switching his tail negligently,
  "but I shall always call YOU Handy Mandy. It suits you, m'lass, and you
  need no longer consider yourself a slave."
 "Ho, ho, I never did," roared the Goat Girl, glancing cheerfully down at her
  lordly companion. "That was just a joke, wasn't it? You know, everything in
  this Land of Oz is extremely funny and peculiar. Two-armed natives, animals
  talking, Kings disappearing, and mysterious messages and prophecies."
 "People always think a new country is strange!" observed the ox
  philosophically. "To us it seems quite right and natural. But I daresay if
  I were to find myself on Mt. Mern I'd consider everything there very odd
  and upsetting; rocks flying through the air, for instance, and landing one
  soft and light as a daisy in a strange King's garden."
 "But all of our rocks don't fly. In fact, I never knew one to do such a
  thing before. And no wonder I landed as soft as a daisy C4 there was a
  blue daisy under me, or I'd have been splintered to smithereens!"
 "Daisy?" Nox licked his lips hungrily. "You never said anything about a
  daisy."
 "Oh, I never tell all I know," confided Handy, "especially to
  Hi-qui-cockadoodlums like the King and his Counselors. But there was a
  daisy C4 growing on the rock, and I picked it. As I started to fall, I
  began pulling off the petals, and when I landed I came down on a high, huge
  pile of them, a heap as high as a haystack," continued Handy Mandy

  dreamily. "So I slid off the stack and turned to look at the castle, and
  when I looked again, the petals were gone, but there was the daisy itself
  growing up as pert as you please in this strange garden. So what did I do
  but pick it again, and here it is!" Triumphantly, Handy pulled the blue
  flower from her pocket.
 "My, what a dear little daisy!" murmured the Ox. "How delicious it would
  taste."
 "No! NO!" cried Handy as Nox rolled his long tongue out toward the flower.
  "It's too pretty to eat."
 "Nothing's too pretty to eat," replied the ox plaintively. "Funny it hasn't
  wilted, though."
 "Well, I believe it's magic," stated the Goat Girl with a positive little
  shake of her head. As she returned the daisy to her pocket, Handy felt the
  hard metal object that had hit her in the forehead when she and Nox plowed
  through the King's garden. "Look! What do you suppose this is?" she
  queried, tapping the Ox sharply on the shoulder, for he was walking
  sleepily along with his eyes closed. "This is what we dug up when we rushed
  through the garden, you know."
 "How should I know?" grunted the Ox indifferently, opening one eye. "Just a
  silver hammer, isn't it? Maybe we can trade it for a good breakfast when we
  cross the river."
 "MyC4y how you talk!" scolded Handy. "We're not going to trade it at all.
  See, there's an initial on it. A big W. Now what would W stand for?"
 "Who, what, which, where, oh why worry?" mumbled the Ox, plodding resignedly
  along beside her.
 "Well, anyway, it will make a splendid potato masher," concluded the Goat

  Girl, returning the hammer to her pocket.
 "Yes, if we had any potatoes." The Ox sighed heavily as he spoke, looking
  off into the distance with such a mournful eye Handy Mandy laughed a little
  all to herself.
 "Oh, cheer up," sniffed the Goat Girl, "you're not starved yet. And hurry
  up, too, the sun's going higher every moment, and we'd better pass those
  farms before the people waken."
 It was against Nox's nature to hurry, but realizing the wisdom of the Goat
  Girl's advice, he broke into an awkward gallop. In spite of his great
  weight, the Royal creature was light as a daisy on his feet, and except for
  the faint rattle of Handy's weapons they made little noise as they ran past
  the dome-shaped blue houses and barns of the Munchkin farmers. "Couldn't we
  stop for a few greens?" puffed Nox, looking longingly over the fence at a
  field of cabbages.
 "Not here, dearC4ear!" Red-faced and breathless, the Goat Girl ran on.
  "Wait till we cross this riverC4iver."
 "But I'm not used to this sort of thing," complained Nox peevishly. "Running
  races before breakfast on an empty stomach. No bath, no brush, no rubdown!"
 "Well, here's your brush," gasped Handy, picking her way through a dense
  thicket as the highway ended in a small wood, "and yonder's your bath,
  Mister. MyC4y, what a blue river!"
 "Everything's blue in the Munchkin Country of Oz," Nox told her sulkily as
  sharp briars and thorns reached out to scratch his satiny hide.
 "Even the Royal Ox of Keretaria," hinted Mandy with a sly wink. "Oh, the
  river's blue and the houses are blue and even the wind blew C4 Hoo Hoo!

  Come on."
 "Don't try to be funny," with heaving sides, the Ox stepped on the edge of
  the gleaming blue stream. "Don't try to be funny, I beg."
 "Oh, I don't have to try, I am!" laughed Handy, flinging the axe, the rake,
  the spade, the sword, the gun and the broomstick across the river.
 "Wait!" snorted the Ox as Handy, having got rid of her load, raised all of
  her hands above her head and prepared to dive in. "Wait, can you swim?"
 "I don't know, but I'll soon find out," cried Handy, and before Nox could
  prevent it, the Goat Girl leapt off the bank and disappeared beneath the
  blue waters of the Munchkin River. For once, Nox forgot his dignity and
  Royal station and plunged frantically after his reckless companion.
  Swimming around with his head under water, he finally located Handy Mandy,
  and gripping her yellow plaits firmly in his teeth dragged her to the
  opposite bank. The Goat Girl was so full of water she had little say and
  lay soggily on the grass while Nox looked down at her with mingled
  admiration and concern.
 "Never do such a thing again," he wheezed severely as Handy finally sat up
  and began wringing the water from her voluminous skirts. "Swimming is an
  art and must be learned and practiced. But for oat's sake, why didn't you
  flap all those arms when you hit the water?" he finished irritably.
 "Oh, is that what you're supposed to do? This way?" Before Nox could step a
  step, the Goat Girl had jumped into the river again. This time, instead of
  going down, she splashed and whirled her seven arms so fast and furiously
  she just managed to keep her head above water. But Nox, now thoroughly
  annoyed and without giving her a chance to get far from shore, waded in and
  determinedly dragged her back to dry land.

 "What in sky-blue onions are you trying to do?" he sputtered angrily, "Drown
  yourself?"
 "No, I'm trying to swim," coughed the Goat Girl, struggling to get away from
  the angry Ox. "Do you suppose I'm going to let this Munchkin River get the
  best of me?"
 "Yes, and while you are swimming, or rather practicing your swimming, some
  of these Keretarians will come and capture us," gurgled Nox. "Are we
  escaping or are we swimming? Quick now, make up your mind."
 Nox's earnest words brought Handy quickly to her senses, and as the Royal Ox
  let go her skirts she snatched up her weapons and, without waiting to wring
  out her clothes, started briskly across the meadows.
 "Never mind, you'll be a fine swimmer some day," said Nox, trotting more
  amiably beside her. The cool river water had refreshed the Royal creature,
  and Handy Mandy's determination and courage made him a little ashamed of
  his own complaints. "Takes a little practice, that's all."
 "Practice!" repeated Handy, dripping water from every plait and pore. "Well,
  just wait till we come to the next river; I'll show you! But LOOK, here are
  more blue houses, so we must still be in the Munchkin Country."
 "Yes, but we're out of Keretaria," Nox reminded her cheerfully. "What's that
  signpost say, my girl?"
 Hurrying forward, Handy squinted up at the rough board nailed to a blue
  spruce, and then began to clench and unclench her one free fist.
 "TURN HERE!" directed the sign. "Turn here and go straight back where you
  came from."
 "Well, I'll be buttered!" cried the Goat Girl, throwing down every one of

  her weapons. "I'll be churned and buttered."
 "But what had we butter do?" muttered the Royal Ox, so taken aback by the
  saucy message that even his tongue was twisted.
 "Why, we'll go straight on, of course," declared Handy Mandy, tossing her
  yellow plaits defiantly. "Who are whoever they are to tell us our
  business?" And recovering her weapons one by one, the Goat Girl tramped
  down the crooked lane directly ahead of them, the Royal Ox with lifted nose
  and horns, stepping warily behind her.
  
 CHAPTER 6
 TURN TOWN!
 Determined as she was, Handy found it impossible to go straight on, for the
  lane curved and twisted this way and that, ending finally in a perfect
  corkscrew turn. The trees on both sides were now so dense Handy and the
  Royal Ox could not have left the road even had they wished to do so. "We're
  going round and round and getting nowhere," said Nox in an abused voice.
  "Of all the roads in Oz, why did we have to pick this one?"
 "Because it dared us, I suppose. HiC4Yi!" exclaimed Handy, leaning against
  a tree to rest. "I'm dizzy as a bat and hungry as a goat."
 "Too bad you're not a goat," murmured Nox, who had stopped to nibble the
  lower branches of a maple. "These leaves are quite tender."
 "Well, I may come to them," sighed Handy, looking at him enviously. "But
  shall we go on? I think one more turn will bring us out of here."
 Handy was right, for one more round brought them to the end of corkscrew
  lane, but only to find themselves facing a high, forbidding wall. There
  were a gate and turnstile in the wall, and beyond the Goat Girl caught a

  glimpse of a confused, whirling village where everything seemed to be
  turning round or over. "It's just because I'm so dizzy," thought Handy,
  clutching her head with her one free hand. But Nox, peering over her
  shoulder, gave a loud and indignant bellow as a house on the corner of the
  street nearest them turned completely over and began spinning merrily on
  its chimney, while the fence running around the bakery shop next door
  started really to run around, kicking up its posts with great glee and
  abandon.
 "HuC4what kind of silly place is this?" rumbled the Ox, backing hastily
  away. But Handy Mandy had seen a whole row of little pies in the bakeshop
  window, and motioning vigorously for Nox to follow, stepped over the stile
  and through the movable gate. It was too much of a squeeze for Nox, but
  determined not to be left behind, he jumped neatly over. A revolving sign
  on one of the large public buildings caught their attention at once, but as
  the building was going one way and the sign another, it was several minutes
  before they could discover what it said.
 "TURN TOWN!" read the Goat Girl in some surprise. "So that's where we are!
  And would you looC4ook, every house on every street is going round or
  over. MercyC4ercy on us, and where do you suppose the people are?"
 "Turning over and over in their beds, I take it. It is still quite early,
  you know," whispered the Royal Ox, speaking cautiously out of the corner of
  his mouth. "But come on, the streets are not turning, and perhaps if we
  hurry we can go through before they waken and turn on us. Hurry, hurry.
  What are you waiting for?"
 "Food," sighed Handy wistfully. "I thought I might catch us a few pies, Old

  Toggins. Here, watch my stuff, and I'll bring us each some."
 Nox looked sharply up and down the street, as the Goat Girl set down her
  axe, rake, spade, gun, broom and sword and started off toward the bakery.
  Not only the fence, but the shop itself was turning now. Handy quite
  cleverly waited till the gate came opposite her and dashed through, but the
  open door of the shop kept going by so rapidly she was knocked down several
  times before she finally darted inside. As she disappeared, Nox gave an
  uneasy snort, but cheered up as the shop window came past and he saw Handy
  with a pie in every hand smile at him reassuringly. But alas, the whirling
  floor of the shop was too much for the Goat Girl, and as she started out,
  there was a clatter of broken china and falling furniture.
 "Great Gazoo, what's she done now?" moaned Nox as Handy leaped through the
  door and fell sprawling in the little garden. She still had six of the pies
  clutched in her various hands, but as she jumped up and raced through the
  garden gate, windows all up and down the street were flung open. From the
  rightside-up ones and the downside-down ones kinky little black heads came
  popping out by the hundred.
 "Turn out! Turn out! Topsies turn out!" yelled the excited citizens, their
  voices going higher and higher. "Thieves, robbers, tramps and
  Stand-Stillians!"
  
 "Here," gasped the Goat Girl, reaching Nox in one bound. "Eat these quick
  and destroy the evidence." Stuffing one of the tarts into her own mouth,
  Handy made a wry face. "Ugh, TURNIPS!" choked the Goat Girl, dropping the
  other five in huge disgust. "Whoever heard of turnip turnovers?"
 "I'll eat them," offered Nox, lapping up the little pies in his stride. "But

  run! Hurry, here come the natives!" But before Handy could snatch up her
  weapons, the Topsies, hurling out of windows and doors, came whirling down
  upon them. Startled though she was, the Goat Girl could not disguise her
  interest and curiosity. With one arm around Nox's neck and the other six
  stretched stiffly before her to keep back the screeching crowd, she stared
  with round and fascinated eyes. And no wonder! The Topsies were about as
  tall as children, but where their feet should have been they had sharp,
  horny pegs. Another peg of the same description sprung from each kinky
  head. With their plump hands the small black-and-blue men and women spun
  themselves along by cords attached to their round little middles, and they
  kept reversing themselves, spinning first on one end and then another in a
  manner very upsetting and confusing to their visitors. The hum made by the
  Topsies' spinning and their loud, raucous cries filled the early morning
  air, and as Handy tried to push her way through the crowd several butted
  her with their sharp pegs.
 "Ouch! Stop that!" bellowed Nox, who had been butted too. "Keep still,
  m'lass, and sooner or later these little pests will run down."
 "Turn them out! Turn them in! Turn them round! Turn them over!" shrieked the
  Topsies hysterically. In the midst of the dreadful confusion, a Topsy
  taller than all the rest came zooming down the middle of the street. "Look!
  STAND-STILLIANS!" shouted a round little spinster waving both arms.
  "Travelers with legs instead of pegs. Robbers! Thieves! And tramps, your
  Topjesty."
 "Yes, and they have broken into my shop and stolen all my turnip turnovers,"
  screamed the Topsy Baker, spinning round in indignant circles. "Aha, you

  wait, here comes the Tip-Topper. Now you'll catch it, you C4 you Turnover
  snatchers, you!"
 "Now you'll catch it!" shrilled all the rest of the Topsies, spinning faster
  and faster till Handy and Nox were dizzy just from looking at them.
 Except for his size and a flag fluttering from the peg on his head,
  Tip-Topper looked just like his subjects. "Spin! Spin!" he whistled
  angrily. "What do you mean standing still in the middle of Turn Town? Don't
  you realize you are breaking every one of our rotary laws? Why are you
  here? Did you come to do us a good turn or a bad?"
 "Turn 'em down! Turn 'em out! Turn 'em over! Turn 'em round!" insisted the
  townsmen shrilly. Between the revolving houses and the spinning Topsies,
  Handy Mandy scarcely knew which foot she was standing on. As for Nox, he
  gave a great groan, and closing his eyes left everything to his companion.
  Handy put two hands over her ears, and raising all the others addressed
  Tip-Topper in a firm and reasonable manner.
 "Tell your people to stand back," directed the Goat Girl calmly. "All we
  wish is to pass quietly through your city and never return. NEVER!" she
  repeated emphatically. It was hard to speak to a person who kept going
  round and round, but at every third turn Handy managed to catch
  Tip-Topper's eye, and at last he seemed to catch her idea.
 "Very well, then, GO!" he commanded haughtily. "And at once!" But when
  Handy, without stopping to pick up her weapons, started forward, perfect
  shrieks of anger rose on all sides.
 "Not that way! Not what way. Turn! Turn! Turn!" yelled the Topsies. And
  getting back of Handy and the Royal Ox, they tried to push them round by
  main force.

 "Stop! Stop! It's no use," panted Tip-Topper as Nox, letting out a frightful
  bellow, laid seven Topsies by the pegs with his left hind foot and Handy
  with a sweep of her arms swept down ten more. "They're all made wrong.
  Fetch the Turn Coat, drive them to the turning point, and we'll turn them
  to Topsies in two shakes of a tent pole."
 "MC4mmmmmmm! MC4mmmmmmm! Did you hear what I heard?" Nox peered
  desperately around at Handy, who was now spinning dizzily herself as she
  was flung and pushed from one group to another. "Could they really turn us
  to Topsies?"
 "I don't know! I don't know! Oh, my head, my HEAD!" moaned the Goat Girl,
  clutching it with all hands. "It's going round and roundFF20C4"
 "Fine! Fine! That's the way!" cheered the Topsies heartily. "You'll be
  spinning circles before you know it and have beautiful wool like the rest
  of us."
 "Wool!" gasped Handy, who was extremely fond of her shining yellow braids.
  "Oh, I wool not. That's just too much! Stand back, you little buzzards, and
  I'll show you a turn or two myself."
 "Go ahead," said Turn Uppins, who seemed next in importance to Tip-Topper
  himself. "It's your turn anyway. Stand back, Topsies, and let this waddling
  whangus show us what she can do."
 At a signal from their leader, the Turn Towners fell back a pace and,
  spinning in a loud, agitated circle, impatiently waited for the Goat Girl
  to take her turn. First Handy shook her head to dispel the dizziness, then
  with a loud screech she flung her arms and heels into the air in such a
  succession of handsprings that even the Topsies were impressed. The seventh

  brought her back to the Royal Ox, and in the center of a now cheering and
  admiring circle, she turned fifty more so fast that she looked like an
  animated cartwheel with arms and legs for spokes. A loud buzz of applause
  went up as Handy finally fell over from sheer exhaustion, but then they
  began pointing accusing fingers at Nox. "Look! Look at the stupid
  Gumflumox, why he hasn't turned a single hair."
 "How about turning on them," raged Nox, "and tossing a few dozen on my
  horns? Hop on my back, m'lass, and we'll make a run for it."
 "No! No! There are too many. We'll be perfectly punctured," worried Handy as
  seven Topsies prodded the Royal Ox sharply in the flank. "We might run
  right into that turning point, too. Wait! Wait! I'll think of something. We
  don't want to spin on here forever, what$$ever&& happens! WhewC4hewey,
  what a dust the little pests kick up. I'd give my best hand for a drink;
  I'm choking with thirst. Oh! Oh! I wish I were in a river right this
  minute." Steadying herself by holding to Nox's right horn, Handy faced the
  angry multitude.
 "Turn! Turn! Take your turn!" shouted the Topsies incessantly. "Can't you
  even turn your head, old four-leg?"
 "Of course he can," shouted Handy Mandy, clapping six of her hands for
  silence. "Not only his head, but his horns. Watch this, my friends!" The
  Goat Girl gave the horn she was leaning on a sharp twist.
 "Not that one. Not that one!" fumed the Ox anxiously. "Quick, the other.
  It's the other one, I tell you! Oh, my hide, hair, and Heavens! Ulp! Gurgle
  Ooooop!"
 And "Oooop gurgle ULP!" it was with everyone, for at Handy Mandy's second
  turn, Nox's horn came completely off, and as the Goat Girl held it up for

  the Topsies to see, out spurted a perfect torrent of water that flooded the
  whole city till every Turner and Topsy-turvy house in it was awash or
  afloat. In wild and astonished voices, the kinky-headed little citizens
  called out to each other as they bobbed up and down like corks on the
  raging tide. And just as wet and surprised as the Topsies, the Goat Girl
  and Nox were swept along by the impetuous flood.
  
 CHAPTER 7
 A HORN OF PLENTY
 After the first awful ducking, Handy, without losing a second began to
  practice her swimming. Striking out with strength and purpose and her seven
  good arms, she managed to keep abreast of Nox, who was moving easily along
  in the center of the torrent. Bothersome as the Topsies had been, the Goat
  Girl could not help feeling sorry for the little Turn Towners. At first,
  she feared they would all go down. But they just spun like water bugs on
  the surface, and while they made no progress, they seemed in little danger
  of drowning. In fact, they could no more sink than corks or kindling. So
  busy with her own struggles, Handy dismissed them from her mind and tried
  to figure out the reason for the sudden and overwhelming rush of water that
  had deluged the city.
 At any rate, it was fine to be rid of the Topsies, she reflected
  philosophically, and when the flood did recede Turn Town would be good as
  new and twice as clean. The current was racing along so swiftly now that
  the last Topsy had long since disappeared, leaving only herself and Nox in
  the broad, tumbling expanse of water. Nox had not uttered a word since his

  first outcry when the flood had overtaken them, but he looked so glum and
  disagreeable that Handy, thrashing along beside him, wondered what would be
  the best way to start a conversation. As it happened, the Royal beast saved
  her the trouble by starting one himself.
 "Well," he snorted bitterly. "I see you still have it."
 "WHAT?" gulped the Goat Girl, forgetting to use her arms for a moment and in
  consequence shipping about a bucket of water. "Ulp C4 gulp C4 have what?"
 "My horn. HORN!" gurgled Nox, glaring at her angrily over a wave. "And if in
  the future you will keep your hands, all of them, off my horns, it will be
  the better for us." This seemed to Handy a very unjust and unreasonable
  attitude for Nox to take, but she was too occupied keeping afloat to stop
  and argue the matter.
 "Swim closer and I'll screw it back," she offered, obligingly holding up the
  wooden hand in which she still clutched the right half of the royal
  headgear. But at this, poor Nox was deluged by a robust stream that still
  poured from the golden horn. Hastily plunging it under the surface again,
  Handy watched her fellow adventurer emerge sputtering and furious from the
  depths.
 "Well of all the stupid tricks!" gasped the Ox, swimming rapidly away from
  her. "Stop. Keep off. Don't you dare come near me."
 "But see here," panted Handy, going after him in real exasperation, "after
  all, it is your horn, and am I to blame if there is a river inside? What do
  you want me to do, throw it away?"
 "No! No!" bellowed the Ox, stopping short and looking frantically over his
  shoulder. "If you throw it away, I'll look like a fool. If you keep holding
  it, we'll spend the rest of our lives swimming round in this torrent. If

  you screw it back on my head, it will probably give me water on the brain.
  Oh, blub glub! What shall we do? THINK of something, can't you, before we
  both drown in your stupid old river?"
 "My river!" Handy Mandy was so indignant that for a moment she was perfectly
  speechless.
 "Yes, your river!" roared Nox, treading water angrily. "Didn't you wish for
  a river just before you jerked off my horn? Well, this is it, and I hope
  you like it."
 "Why Nox, how clever of you to guess," bubbled the Goat Girl, a great light
  breaking over her wet head. "I remember now. I was thirsty and wished for a
  drink, then a whole river. And lo! a river was here."
 "You mean HIGH it was here," raged Nox, beginning to swim again.
 "But look," cried Handy, beating and slapping the water exultantly with her
  many hands. "If that is so, all we have to do is to wish it away again. I'm
  still holding the magic horn, and there's magic in it, old Toddywax C4
  MAGIC! I here and now wish this river AWAY."
 Handy yelled her wish in a booming voice that almost split the Ox's
  eardrums, and both were so sure the wish would be granted they stopped
  swimming, so both had a fine ducking as the river continued to rush merrily
  and unconcernedly over their heads.
 "Bosh! It wasn't magic, after all. MyC4y, if I ever get out of here, I'll
  never go swimming again as long as I live," sobbed Handy, pushing her arms
  and legs wearily through the water.
 "Oh, I think I'll just sink and be done with it," moaned the Ox, churning
  breathlessly along beside her.

 "You think you'll sink!" exclaimed Handy, popping her head up indignantly.
  "Don't you dare sink and leave me here all alone. Besides, we set out to
  find that little King, and we're going to find him! Where's your sporting
  blood?"
 "Watered!" gurgled the Royal Ox in a faint voice. "Goodbye, m'lass, you
  probably did it all for the best!" It seemed to the Goat Girl that Nox was
  really sinking, so flinging out her leather hand she grasped him firmly by
  his left horn. Then, acting quickly and before he could object, Handy
  pushed his head under water and quickly screwed his right horn in place.
 "I wish this dumb river would go straight back where it came from," quavered
  Handy as Nox, bellowing and bubbling, backed indignantly away. And THIS
  TIME the river went. So suddenly and completely the Goat Girl and the Ox
  were dropped forty feet to the bottom of a rocky gorge through which the
  torrent had been tumbling. For a long moment, they lay where they had
  fallen, then stiffly they arose and peered anxiously around them. Handy,
  thanks to her voluminous petticoats, was saved from serious injury, and
  Nox, who had landed in a patch of brush, was not dangerously hurt either.
  But they both were so shocked, shaken and worn out from their long swim,
  they were perfectly content to stay where they were.
 "You see," sighed Handy, wringing out her skirts with four hands and
  smoothing back her hair with the other three, "the magic is in the horn and
  only works when you are wearing it. As soon as I screwed it back and made
  the wish, everything was all right."
 "Oh, was it?" Scowling round at his scratched flanks and skinned shins, the
  Royal Ox shook his head dubiously.
 "And just think," continued the Goat Girl brightly, "if your horn really is

  a wishing horn, as soon as we decide where we want to go, all we have to do
  is wish ourselves there."
 "No! No! Absolutely no more of that," squealed Nox, lashing his tail and
  flashing his eyes dangerously. "Your last wish nearly killed me, and if any
  more wishing is to be done, I'll attend to it myself."
 "But how can you unscrew or even touch your own horn all by yourself?"
  inquired Handy reasonably. "You see, you need my hands, and I need your
  horns." Throwing back her head, Handy burst into a loud chuckle, thinking
  how comical she would look if she actually wore Nox's golden headgear.
 "Oh, why not go on the way we started?" said the Ox querulously. "I'd rather
  travel on my feet than my horns any day, and had you noticed, Handy, that
  these rocks are purple? Your river has carried us clear into the Gillikin
  Country where there are mountains galore, and even a silver one for all we
  know."
 "Yes, but is there anything to eat?" asked the Goat Girl in a hollow voice.
  "If those rude little Topsies had just given us some breakfast."
 "I expect all they eat is spinach or turnips," sniffed Nox, "and you would
  not have cared for either. Well, at any rate we're even. You certainly
  turned the tide on them, m'lass." Nox, who was beginning to feel more
  cheerful, began to shake all over. "I'll wager my tail they'll be more
  polite to travelers in the future."
 "Well, as it all turned out so well, let's make another wish," proposed
  Handy Mandy practically. "Let's wish ourselves out of here. No use
  scrambling over all these rocks when all we have to do is wish yourselves
  to the spot where your little King happens to be."

 "M-m-mm, M-m-m!" mused Nox, half closing his eyes. "Nothing is as easy as
  that, and I cannot help feelingFF20C4"
 "Neither can I," said Handy, and stepping briskly up to the royal Ox, she
  gave his right horn a determined twist, at the same time saying softly: "I
  wish myself and Nox with Kerry, the rightful ruler of Keretaria." Nox
  twitched his ears nervously as his horn came off in the Goat Girl's best
  white hand, and Handy herself, with all her arms outspread as if she were a
  bird about to take flight, waited in rapturous expectation for her wish to
  take effect. But this time nothing at all happened. Neither she nor the Ox
  moved an inch.
 "There you are. I told you it wouldn't work," grumbled Nox, looking at her
  crossly. "It's probably not magic at all."
 "Oh yes it is," insisted Handy, screwing up her eye and peering down into
  the hollow interior. "It gave us a river when we asked for it, and you
  can't get away from that."
 "We certainly had a hard enough time getting away from it," agreed her
  companion. "Come now, be a good girl, screw back that horn, and let's be
  starting on."
 "But I just cannot understand why it grants some wishes and not others,"
  muttered Handy discontentedly. "When I was thirsty and wished for a river,
  I got a riverFF20C4 AHA! I have it. This horn gives you things but does
  not take you places. Now let's see, what do we need the most?"
 "Breakfast," suggested the Ox in an interested voice. "Oats and apples for
  me, eggs, rolls and coffee for you. But for GOAT'S sake be careful how you
  wish, m'lass. We don't want too much even of a good thing, and one can
  drown in coffee or smother in oats. Remember the river and be exact as to

  size and quantity."
 "MyC4y, this wishing is dreadfully complicated." Rubbing her forehead with
  one hand after the other, Handy Mandy prepared to order breakfast. First
  she screwed the right horn back on the head of the Ox, then, pursing her
  lips firmly, she spoke: "I wish for Nox two measures of oats and apples;
  for myself two plates of eggs and rolls and one cup of coffee." Turning the
  horn round till it came off once more, the Goat Girl almost held her breath
  as the two breakfasts were set promptly and noiselessly down on the rock at
  her feet.
 "Now you're getting the idea!" Happily Nox advanced upon his breakfast.
 "Say, isn't this simply manubious?" cried Handy, snapping her thirty-five
  fingers for sheer joy. "Why, Nox, your horn is a real horn of plenty!"
 "And plenty of trouble if you don't watch your wishes," mumbled her partner,
  already up to his ears in oats.
 "Oh, I'll be careful, never fear," promised Handy, screwing the horn back on
  its base and falling upon her breakfast with a right good will and
  appetite. "Won't the eyes of the villagers back home stick out when I tell
  them about this?"
 "Yes, provided you ever GET home," observed the Ox, who seemed always to
  take a dark view of the future. But Handy Mandy, popping the last of the
  biscuits into her mouth, scarcely heard him. Now that they need no longer
  worry about provisions for the journey, she felt that they would safely
  reach the Silver Mountain wherever it might be, rescue the little King from
  his enemies, and restore him to his throne. Then after seeing all she
  wished of the marvelous country of Oz, she would return to Mt. Mern and

  startle the country folk with the amazing story of her travels.
 "Come along," she called gaily. "Let's climb out of here." With some
  astonishment, they watched the empty containers and dishes vanish away, and
  then, saying very little but thinking a great deal, the two adventurers
  began to scramble up the rocky sides of the gorge.
  
 CHAPTER 8
 HANDY MANDY LEARNS ABOUT OZ!
 Handy, who had climbed up and down mountains all her life, reached the top
  of the gorge first, and with her various hands tugged Nox up the last steep
  incline.
 "So this is the Gillikin Country!" panted the Goat Girl, staring away over
  the heather-covered Highlands. "Now about the natives: do they spin,
  bounce, or tumble?"
 "That I really couldn't say," gasped Nox, leaning against a tree to regain
  his wind. "But as you can see, my girl, all the hills, trees and vegetation
  shade from violet to purple. Lovely color, purple!"
 "I suppose purple would appeal to a Royal Ox like you." Resting her hands on
  her hips, Handy Mandy squinted critically about her. "Now as for me, I
  prefer the more cheerful colors, red, yellow or green, for instance."
 "Then you'd like the Quadling and Winkie Countries," murmured Nox, nibbling
  languidly at the tops of the heather, "or the Emerald City. We have all
  color countries in Oz, and a body can take his choice."
 "Oh, we'll just take them as they come," decided the Goat Girl sensibly, "or
  at least till we find your young Master and this Silver Mountain. But tell
  me, Nox, is each country in Oz a different color, and is there really an

  Emerald City?" Moving slowly through the heather, the Royal Ox nodded his
  lordly head.
 "Take that stick," he directed, coming to a ponderous stop, "and I'll show
  you how Oz looks. See, on that level bit of sand there, just draw an
  oblong." Quite interested, Handy marked out an oblong with the point of the
  stick. "Connect the corners," breathed the Ox, lifting his forefoot
  complacently, "and what have you?"
 "Four triangles," answered the Goat Girl promptly.
 "Put a circle in the center where all the triangles meet." Nox fairly
  radiated pride and importance as he geozophy lesson progressed.
 "Then what?" demanded Handy, the stick upraised in her rubber hand.
 "That's all!" Tossing back his horns, the Ox surveyed his pupil
  triumphantly. "Simple, isn't it? That triangle on the west is the blue
  Munchkin Country we have just left, the triangle to the north is the purple
  Gillikin Country we are just entering. Over there on the east we have the
  Yellow empire of the Winkies, and to the south the red lands of the
  Quadlings. In the circle is the Emerald City of Oz, and surrounding the
  whole Kingdom is a deadly desert of burning sand."
 "MyC4y!" marveled the Goat Girl, clasping all her hands but one behind her
  back. "The desert I crossed when I fell in Keretaria?"
 "Of course," answered Nox, snapping lazily at a purple dragonfly. "Mt. Mern
  must lie to the west of Oz on the other side of the deadly desert. There
  are many countries beyond the desert, but I know very little about them, as
  there are only Oz maps in the castle at home."
 "Then I suppose the King of Keretaria is King of the Munchkins?" said Handy,

  looking thoughtfully down at her map.
 "Oh, my, no!" The Royal Ox positively chuckled at such an idea. "Keretaria
  is just one of the small countries of the West. Cheeriobed is King of the
  Munchkins, and he lives in the Sapphire City seventy leagues below our
  southernmost borderline. Glinda, the Good Sorceress, rules all the small
  Kingdoms in the Quadling Country, the Tin Woodman of Oz is Emperor of the
  Winkies, and Jo King governs the Gillikins. Besides these, there are Kings,
  Queens and Princes galore, but most important of all is Ozma, the young
  Fairy who lives in the Emerald City, for Ozma is supreme sovereign of the
  entire Kingdom of Oz."
 "DearC4ear, what a lot to remember," groaned the Goat Girl. "And all these
  other Kings and Queens have to do what Ozma says? However does she keep
  track of them all? I'll bet they're worse than a flock of goats."
 "Oh, she manages," said the Ox, beginning to move slowly forward. "Being a
  fairy and having a wizard right in her own castle, Ozma knows what is going
  on without even turning her head."
 "Even where we are going?" exclaimed Handy Mandy indignantly. "HiC4yi, what
  a little busybody. I just know I won't like her."
 "Well, in that case she will just have to give up her throne and throw her
  crown out of the window, I suppose! Better have a care, m'lass, you're
  speaking of a powerful fairy, you know." Nox looked so stern as he went
  plowing through the heather that Handy began to feel a little uneasy
  herself.
 "But how could a fairy in the center of Oz see way off here?" she demanded
  scornfully.
 "Magic, that's how!" explained Nox, looking very calm and superior. "In her

  castle, Ozma has a magic picture that shows her everything she wishes to
  see."
 "I don't believe it," scoffed the Goat Girl, swinging all her arms
  recklessly, "and besides, why would she wish to see us and this particular
  piece of country at this particular minute?"
 "I'm sure I don't know," said the Royal Ox haughtily. "But I do say, be
  careful. There, what did I tell you?" Framed in the woodwork of a small
  summerhouse they were approaching was a large poster.
 "You are now in the Land of Oz," stated the poster pleasantly enough. "Be
  good to us, and we'll be good to you. Keep our laws and practice no magic,
  either for good or evil. By order of Her Imperial Highness, Queen Ozma of
  Oz." Below was the bright green seal of Oz and a picture of its pretty
  dark-haired ruler.
 "Why, she's nothing but a little girl!" cried Handy, positively aghast at
  such a state of affairs. "How could a little mite like that rule a whole
  country and be so bossy?"
 "Oh, hush!" begged Nox, rolling his eyes anxiously. "Mite or not, Ozma is a
  mighty powerful and important fairy."
 "Well, we're pretty important ourselves," sniffed the Goat Girl, squinting
  at the poster with all her arms akimbo. "And besides," Handy lifted her
  chin defiantly, "we've broken the law already when we used your gold horn
  of plenty. `Practice no magic.' Hoh! What does she expect us to do with
  good magic right at hand C4 starve? But, ho ho! We can get around that,
  old Toggins. After all, we are not practicing magic, we don't have to
  practice it C4 our magic is perfect, so put that in your pipe and smoke

  it, Miss Ozma to Bozma." Snatching up a rock in each of her seven hands,
  Handy flung them hilariously over a clump of prune trees. (Yes, prunes
  already wrinkled grow in the Land of Oz.) There was an uncomfortable little
  silence after Handy's rash outburst, then a perfect tempest of shrieks and
  screeches.
 "Now see what you've done," gulped the Ox, switching his tail nervously.
  "Quick, quick, jump on my back and we'll rush by. These chaps look
  dangerous."
 "Why, they have HOOK noses!" sputtered Handy, too startled to move as a band
  of kilted Highlanders came racing down toward them. The noses of these
  singular Hillmen were long and thin, curving out and up far above their
  foreheads. On these hooks hung dangerous-looking rings almost as large as
  barrel hoops. While Handy was wondering what they could be for, the nearest
  Hooker pulled a ring from his nose and flung it with all his might at her
  head.
 "Up, UP!" bellowed Nox, pawing the ground in his agitation. "Are you going
  to stand there till you are pegged like a top?" The iron ring missed Handy
  by mere inches, and grasping Nox's horn, she pulled herself to his back.
  There were about sixty of the hooknoses, and swinging to the left Nox tried
  to skirt the warlike tribe, but they were too quick for him, and spreading
  out in a long line, they began hurling their wicked, whizzing weapons. One
  caught neatly on the horn of the Royal Ox, another hit Handy a horrid blow
  on the knee, and as Nox, snorting and furious, turned to run, a dozen more
  came whanging down about their ears. Dodging left and right, Handy Mandy
  leaned forward and began to unscrew Nox's right horn.
 " `Be good to us and we'll be good to you!' HOH! Like fun you will!"

  muttered the Goat Girl, catching six of the flying missiles in her clever
  hands and tossing them back with all her might. "Take that and these and
  them and THOSE!" Pulling off the Ox's horn with the only hand she had left,
  she added desperately, "I wish a barrel of molasses over the head of each
  Hooknose in this band. Cats, Bats and Billy Goats! They've GOT me!" And
  they had, too, for just as Handy finished her wish, down flashed an iron
  ring, pinioning her arms tightly to her sides. Still grasping the precious
  horn, Handy dug her heels into Nox.
 "Hurt?" grunted the Ox, leaping forward.
 "Not hurt, just hooked and humiliated, can't move a muscle," raged the Goat
  Girl. "But ha ha! Neither can they! LOOK!" Nox, who had been bellowing too
  hard to hear Handy's wish or miss his horn, glanced back hurriedly.
 "Why, what's come over them?" he wheezed in astonishment. "Who snuffed them
  out with barrels, and what's that sticky fluid running all around?"
 "Molasses," Handy told him with extreme satisfaction as she tried vainly to
  wriggle out of her ring. "I wished barrels of molasses on their heads, and
  we'd better dash on while they're stopped and stuck with it."
 "Then you've been breaking the law again," reproached Nox, dodging in and
  out and around their frantic enemies.
 "Well, as between broken heads and broken laws, I choose the laws. Besides,
  look what they did to me!" exclaimed the Goat Girl indignantly. "I may
  never get this hoop off or be able to lift a hand again. Nice people you
  have in Oz, I must say."
 "If you hadn't hit them with stones, they wouldn't have hit us with hoops,"
  Nox reminded her sternly, at the same time breaking into a gallop to put as

  much distance as possible between himself and the troublesome Gillikins. A
  few had managed to lift the barrels from their heads, but most of them were
  rolling over and over on the ground, half choked with rage and molasses.
 "When we stop, I think I can help you," promised Nox, looking anxiously at
  Handy, who was now quite purple in the face from her struggles with the
  hoop. "Just forget it, can't you, and think of the interesting people we
  are meeting. I'll wager you have no hooknoses on Mt. Mern!"
 "I should say NOT!" sputtered the Goat Girl in disgust, and then, realizing
  she was making no progress with the ring, sensibly gave up the attempt to
  free herself. Somewhat comforted by the thought that the Hook Noses were
  probably as uncomfortable as she was, Handy kept a sharp lookout for
  natives. If they ran into any more, she wanted to be sure of seeing them
  first.
 But the rocky hills and glades were entirely deserted, and at every step the
  way became more mountainous and lonely. Nox, panting and wheezing from the
  long pull, slackened his pace to a walk. Handy Mandy with some difficulty
  managed to dismount, and the Ox, slipping his horn under the offending
  ring, gently forced it upward till the Goat Girl was able to wriggle free.
  Then together they climbed up the flinty inclines C4 up and up till they
  came to a wide ledge and a sparkling waterfall. Here they had a drink
  without having to wish for one, Nox sticking his head right into the water
  and Handy cupping three pairs of her hands to hold enough to satisfy her
  thirst.
 "Ho hum," sighed the Ox. "I wonder how much farther we'll have to go before
  we can find anyone who can direct us to this Silver Mountain? I'm sure I
  saw some castles when we were below."

 "So did I," said Handy, screwing his right horn back with a businesslike
  flourish. "MyC4y, seems a long time since we started from Keretaria. Do
  you suppose they have missed us yet?"
 "Probably," yawned the Ox, scratching his back against a rock while Handy,
  suddenly deciding she needed another drink, stepped close to the waterfall.
  But instead of quenching her thirst, the Goat Girl spilled water all over
  her feet.
 "Nox! Nox!" she screamed, jerking all her thumbs in his direction. "Come!
  Look here! There's a big hollow behind this waterfall C4 a high wall of
  rock with a door in it! I can see it!"
 "Well," sniffed the Ox, rubbing his back luxuriously, "does it say `come
  in'? Must we try every door we come to?"
 "Yes," Handy Mandy told him firmly, "we must! Where there's a door there's
  bound to be a doorkeeper or at least someone who might tell us where we
  are. Now then, I'll jump through the waterfall first and knock on the door.
  There wouldn't be room for you on the ledge until the door is open."
 "Sounds risky!" objected the Royal Ox, putting back his ears. "What kind of
  people would live behind a waterfall? Ask yourself that." But the Goat
  Girl, without stopping to ask herself anything, had already plunged through
  the misty sheet of water and, gasping and spluttering, was hammering on the
  door with all seven of her fists.
  
 CHAPTER 9
 THE MAGIC HAMMER
 There was no answer to Handy's loud knocks, and pausing to catch her breath

  and blow on her fingers, the Goat Girl wondered what to try next. Then, in
  spite of Nox's warning bellow, she began to shove and push the wet planks
  with her shoulder. But that did no good either, so she felt in her pocket
  for something to use as a wedge. Almost at once her fingers closed on the
  silver hammer they had plowed up in Keretaria. While the hammer would not
  do for a wedge, it would at least save her knuckles, so, lifting it high
  above her head, Handy Mandy brought it down with a resounding whack. A
  shower of silver sparks followed the hammer blow, and Nox, peering through
  the waterfall, saw a gnarled and crooked elf with a purple beard dancing
  madly round the startled girl.
 "I am the elf of the hammer, who Must do whatever you ask me to," sang the
  elf between his high leaps and prances.
 "Then open this door," directed Handy, spinning round in a circle herself to
  get a good look at the little fellow. "MyC4y, how funny Oz is! Magic
  horns, Topsies, Hook Noses, and now $$you!&& Don't tell me a little body
  like you can really open this great, heavy door?"
 "Pick up the hammer and doubt no more C4 Himself, the elf, will now open
  the door."
 In a daze, Handy Mandy picked up the hammer and put it back in her pocket,
  and Nox, thunderstruck by the whole proceedings, thrust his head through
  the waterfall just in time to see the knobby little gnome push the door
  open with one thump of his brown fist. Quick as a flash, Handy was on the
  other side.
 "Come on! Come on!" she called hoarsely to Nox. "Can't you see it's closing?
  Oh mercyC4ercy, do you want to leave me here all alone?"
 "Yes!" snorted Nox in an exasperated voice, but jumping as he snorted. "I'd

  like nothing better." As he came to "better," he landed on the other side
  of the waterfall and skidded through the open door into the mountain. He
  had just time to tuck in his tail when the door with an ominous creak
  slammed shut.
 "$$Now&& see what you've done!" gasped Nox, eyeing the gloomy interior with
  distaste and foreboding. "IC4thoughtC4youC4were going to be a help to me
  and allC4puffC4splutterC4you do is get me into trouble! What sort of
  place is this, anyway?"
 "A c-c-ave," quavered Handy, wrapping all her arms tightly round herself.
  "MyC4y, it's so highC4igh, I can hardly see the top. Where's that elf?"
 "Gone!" sighed the Ox, taking a cautious step forward. "But I expect he'll
  come back at the first tap of that hammer. All very puzzling, if you ask
  me."
 "Well, shall I call him back?" asked Handy uneasily. "It's kinda lonely in
  here, and maybe Himself could tell us where we are."
 "Better wait till we need him," advised the Ox. "After all, we know we are
  in a cave, seems to be of silver rock, too. Just cast your eye at those
  stalactites, m'lass."
 "So that's what you call 'em," the Goat Girl glanced curiously up at the
  silver icicles hanging in jagged points from the ceiling. "We have caves on
  Mt. Mern, but nothing like this." She looked apprehensively round the
  silent cavern, from which a perfect honeycomb of passageways branched off
  in all directions. "A fine place to get lost, I'd call it," she shivered,
  moving as close as she could to her companion. "What makes this lavender
  light? I see no lamps."

 "Jewels!" confided the Ox in a hushed voice. "See, there are hundreds of
  amethysts embedded in those rocks, each glowing likeFF20C4"
 "An eye!" finished Handy nervously. "And all watching us, I dare say. MyC4y
 , do you suppose anyone lives here? But they mustC4" Unwinding her arms,
  Handy suddenly began snapping all thirty-five of her fingers. "Nox, Nox!"
  she cried excitedly, "I've just thought of something!"
 "Can't you think without shouting?" asked the Ox, flashing his eyes
  suspiciously from left to right.
 "No," said Handy triumphantly, "for this is something to shout about. Look,
  old Toggins, if this is a silver cave, why wouldn't a Silver Mountain be on
  top? All we have to do is open that door and start climbing again."
 "As I remember, there was a sheer precipice back of the waterfall. How could
  we climb that? No, no! The best thing for us to do is to travel down one of
  the passageways and hope it will bring us out on the side of the mountain
  itself."
 "Yes, but which one?" demanded the Goat Girl. "There are about a hundred, it
  seems to me."
 "Let's try that first one to the right," proposed the Ox judiciously. Their
  voices echoed and reverberated back and forth so uncannily in the big,
  hollow cavern that almost without realizing it they began to talk in
  whispers and tread as softly as thieves in the night. Halfway to their
  destination they stopped, rigid with horror and consternation. Thumping
  footsteps were coming toward them from the labyrinth on the left.
 "Some one does live here, after all," said the Goat Girl. "Someone who
  weighs a ton. Hark to that!"
 "Watch yourself!" warned Nox, planting all four feet and making ready to

  charge if the cave dweller proved unfriendly.
 "Oh, my aunt C4 a GIANT!" With a shrill scream, Handy flung all her arms
  round Nox's neck and buried her face in his shoulder. Poor Nox, nearly
  strangled by the Goat Girl's embrace, could neither move nor speak and
  could scarcely breathe. With rolling eyes and quaking legs, he watched the
  monster approach. The Giant's body, almost ten times the size of a grizzly
  bear, was encased in a tight purple uniform with bells instead of buttons
  that jingled whenever he moved. He wore a huge silver helmet, and his neck,
  almost a foot long, kept darting up and down as he shot his head in this
  direction and that.
 "Ho! THERE you are!" he roared, suddenly catching sight of the two travelers
  trembling together in the center of the cavern. "How dare you enter the
  cave of the King of the Silver Mountain without invitation or permission?"
 "This this really $$IS&& the Silver Mountain!" marveled Handy, twisting her
  apron nervously in her wooden fingers.
 "Of course!" yelled the giant, thumping the floor with an enormous silver
  club. "And I, Snorpus the Mighty, am Keeper of the Hidden Door. I am
  OUTKEEPER for this whole mountain," he boasted, truculently expanding his
  chest and looking complacently down at the two midgets at his feet. But
  something in his manner began to reassure the Goat Girl.
 "I'll bet he's as dumb as he's big," she confided hurriedly to Nox. Then,
  raising her voice and all of her arms, she called up loudly, "Then you must
  indeed be strong and sturdy!"
 "Oh, I AM!" bawled the Giant, twirling his silver moustache and fixing Handy
  for a moment with his glittering eye. "Snorpus the Door Keeper is strong as

  an OX!" There was something very peculiar about the eye of the Giant. It
  seemed to revolve on a moving belt, peering out as it passed through the
  four wide-open lids set at intervals round the top of his head, so that
  half the time he was looking the other way.
 "Did you ever see an ox?" inquired Handy politely as the eye of Snorpus
  again flashed by.
 "No, but I'd like to," admitted the Giant, shooting his head out to the
  side.
 "Well, this is an ox," cried Handy, tapping the anxious beast at her side
  with a rubber hand. "And if you are as strong as an ox, you are strong as
  Nox, and nothing much can stop you."
 "How strong is he?" asked Snorpus, lowering himself stiffly to one knee in
  order to get a look at what he had first supposed to be a small and
  insignificant animal.
 "So strong," explained the Goat Girl impressively as she pointed with all
  hands to the side of the cave, "that if he so much as bumped into that wall
  yonder, this whole cavern would collapse like a pack of cards."
 "Then I hope he'll be very careful," faltered Snorpus, taking out a huge
  silk handkerchief to mop his forehead. "It would annoy the King frightfully
  if you destroyed his cavern, and I might even lose my head and position
  here."
 "Oh, he'll be careful," promised Handy Mandy generously. "He, being an ox,
  and you being strong as an ox makes us all friends, doesn't it?"
 "I C4 I suppose so," muttered Snorpus, tapping his knee uncertainly with
  his club. "But just the same, I am still the outkeeper and must do my duty
  at all hazards. AT ALL HAZARDS!" he shouted, standing up to give himself

  courage and puffing out his cheeks like a porpoise.
 "But you have done your duty," bellowed Nox in a voice even louder than the
  doorkeeper's. "If we were outside the mountain, it would be your plain duty
  to keep us there, but since we are already inside, you have nothing more to
  do with us. Isn't that so?" Lowering his head, Nox made a little lunge at
  the Giant's shins. And backing away, Snorpus gave the pair several long,
  puzzled looks.
 "Well, then," he decided finally, "if I have nothing more to do with you,
  you had best come along to the King."
 "That is exactly what we wish to do," answered the Goat Girl promptly.
 "My, you $$are&& brave, aren't you?" The Giant's eye flashed for a moment in
  real admiration upon Handy Mandy; then, picking up his club, he began
  clumping away to the left.
 "Now I wonder what he meant by that?" puffed Nox, for they both had to run
  to even keep the Giant in sight.
 "I don't know," gasped Handy, "but never mind what he means. We still have
  your golden horn and the silver hammer and will manage somehow. But imagine
  getting right inside the Silver Mountain and never knowing it!"
 "Yes, and we may go out the same way," predicted the Royal Ox gloomily,
  following the Giant down the wide, glittering corridor. "I never did like
  these tunnely places or people."
  
 CHAPTER 10
 THE KING OF THE SILVER MOUNTAIN
 "I hear water," worried Handy as Snorpus suddenly vanished round a bend in

  the corridor. "Oh, dearC4ear, I do hope we won't have to go swimming
  again."
 "Then mind your manners!" warned the Royal Ox, giving his horns a little
  shake. "Remember, it is safer to keep on the right side of Kings and
  Giants, and if we are to learn anything about Kerry, we must be extremely
  patient and polite." A loud gasp interrupted Nox's speech, for Handy Mandy,
  well in the lead, had also stepped round the bend. Hastening to catch up
  with her, the Ox, too, gave an involuntary exclamation of wonder and
  astonishment.
 The silver corridor had brought them into a second cavern, smaller than the
  entrance cave but so light and lacy, so bright and beautiful, for once
  Handy Mandy stood perfectly speechless. The silver sides of the dome-shaped
  grotto had been carved to show all the historical figures and characters of
  ancient Oz. Wizards, giants, knights, witches, huntsmen, robbers, kings,
  queens and their patient subjects marched in a splendid procession round
  the walls. Sparkling lavender sand covered the floor, and a lake of
  shimmering quicksilver took up the entire center, lapping the shore with
  its swift soundless waves. On a small island of purest amethyst in the
  middle of this lake, the King of the Silver Mountain reclined at ease. His
  back was toward the newcomers, and he seemed lost in some deep and entirely
  satisfactory contemplation.
 "A king if I ever saw one," breathed Nox moistly in Handy's ear. With a
  wordless nod, the Goat Girl agreed, for in this long, indolent yet majestic
  figure Handy felt she was seeing royalty for the first time. The unusual
  height of the silver monarch was at once apparent, and his tight-fitting
  suit of deepest purple, without ornament save for his jeweled belt and

  sword, set off his handsome figure to the best advantage. His hair, of an
  astonishing thickness, was as silver as his cavern.
 When he turned his head, as he presently did at a little cough from Snorpus,
  Handy saw that his eyes were of a clear and piercing violet. Quietly and
  without hurry, the Silver King rose and, picking up his filigreed crown,
  set it firmly on his head. Then, retrieving a long-stemmed pipe from a
  crevice in the rock, he established himself in a seat carved from the
  amethyst and looked inquiringly across at his visitors.
 "So," he whistled, his eyes sparkling with lively interest as they rested
  for a long moment on the Goat Girl, "two very, VERY clever travelers."
 "Why do you say that?" blurted out Handy, and was instantly overcome at her
  own boldness in speaking to so grand a person.
 "The fact that you are here in this cavern proves you are clever," answered
  the King, leaning over to fill his pipe in the quicksilver lake. "You have
  opened the door in the mountain that does not open; passed the impassable
  guardian and keeper of that door C4 SNORPUS!" The King's pleasant voice
  changed so quickly and cruelly, Handy almost lost her balance. "What have
  you to say for yourself, you lazy Bozwokel?" roared His Majesty, his eyes
  flashing flinty sparks of purple. "I'll have you potted for this, potted
  and reduced to a smithering smith, do you hear?"
 Poor Snorpus, who could not have helped hearing the King's booming sentence,
  dropped to his knees and began pleading, explaining and blubbering all in
  the same breath. Even Nox, startled as he was, tried to put in a good word
  for him. But the muttering monarch, paying no attention to any of them, had
  lifted his silver pipe to his lips, and an enormous bubble was rising from

  the bowl. Handy, with chattering teeth, watched the bubble grow larger and
  larger, float off the pipe, and hover over the unlucky head of the Giant.
  As Snorpus tried in vain to dodge, the bubble broke with the sound like a
  doomsday bell, enveloping him in a cloudy mist. When it cleared away, the
  Giant was indeed reduced, coming now scarcely to Handy's shoulder. "How
  about it, shall we run?" whispered the Goat Girl as the King began to blow
  another bubble. "Boy, do $$I&& feel a draft!"
 "But he's not mad at us!" answered the Ox, ducking nervously as the second
  bubble soared over their heads. "Wait! Be patient; remember the little
  King." As Nox finished speaking, the bubble sailed off and away down one of
  the silver corridors leading away from the royal cavern. Presently they
  heard a bell ringing in the distance as the bubble broke, and before you
  could say Pop Robinson, seventy silver-jacketed little bellboys came
  trotting into the cave.
 "Take this poor failure to Nifflepok and see that he is potted," directed
  the King sternly, setting down his bubble pipe. "Have Timano guard the
  mountain door and see that I am not disturbed. Important matters have come
  up this morning, important matters!"
 "Yes! Yes! Your Highness! It shall be done, Your Excellency!" mumbled the
  bellboys, pushing poor Snorpus ahead of them.
 "Watch yourselves! Watch yourselves!" warned the little Giant as he was
  rudely hustled out of the royal presence.
 "Now," smiled the Silver King, positively beaming upon his visitors, "now we
  can proceed with our conversation. Sorry to trouble you with this small
  matter, but discipline, as the old army officers will tell you, discipline
  must be maintained."

 "Humph!" sniffed Handy Mandy under her breath, looking with dislike and
  disillusion at the royal figure on the rocks. "The Giant was right, you're
  a fellow who'll bear watching." Fortunately, her words did not carry, and
  lazily glancing at them through his long purple lashes, the Silver King
  continued his speech.
 "Since you have so easily entered my mountain," he observed blandly, "I
  assume you have some powerful magic treasure or appliance in your
  possession. Am I right?" At the sudden forward lurch of the Royal Ox and
  Handy Mandy's surprised expression, the King gave a satisfied little nod.
  "Fine!" he chuckled, rubbing his hands together briskly. "And now, let us
  waste no more time. WHO sent you? WHAT have you to offer? As you doubtless
  know, the Wizard of Wutz pays well for magic treasures and formulas."
 "Wizard!" choked Handy Mandy, carelessly clapping her iron hand to her
  forehead and knocking herself over backward. "Wizard!" she repeated,
  dazedly picking herself up. "I thought you were a King!"
 "I am both!" stated the owner of the cavern proudly. "I am King of the
  Silver Mountain and also the Wizard of Wutz, second in importance only to
  Glinda and the Wizard of Oz. And, ha! ha! it won't be long before I am the
  ONLY wizard, the sole, supreme and only Wizard of Oz! Not long! Not long!"
  Again the Silver King rubbed his hands exultantly together. "I have my
  secret agents in every Kingdom in this country and even in the Emerald City
  of Oz," he told them impressively. "I already have the Record Book of
  Glinda, the Good Sorceress, and many more of the magic treasures of Oz, and
  soon I will have them all C4 ALL! My agents are clever, and I have trained
  them well."

 "But I thought magic was against the law!" cried Nox with an outraged snort.
  "I understood no one was allowed to practice magic but Ozma, Glinda and the
  Wizard of Oz!"
 "Then why are you here?" demanded Wutz sternly. "YOU have been practicing
  magic, or you could not have entered this mountain. Come, now, let us stop
  all this nonsense and get down to silver tacks and business. What have you
  to offer? Who sent you: Three, Six, Nine, Five, or Eleven?"
 As you can imagine, this was perfect jargon to Nox and the Goat Girl, but
  Handy Mandy, convinced by this time that the Silver King was both sly and
  dangerous, resolved to fall in with his little supposition and see what
  would come of it.
 "Nine sent us," she answered boldly, while Nox looked across at her in
  perfect stupefaction.
 "You don't say! I rather thought you came from the Munchkin Country," mused
  the Wizard. "Something in the way the Ox20talked, though you, yourself,
  are not a native Ozian?"
 "No!" Handy said noncommitally, rather pleased she had chosen Nine, since
  this number had something to do with the Munchkins.
 "Did Nine say anything about the silver hammer?" asked the King, twinkling
  his eyes at the Goat Girl.
 "He told us nothing," stated Handy, quite truthfully this time.
 "That's Nine for you," fumed the King discontentedly. "He's the slowest and
  most unsatisfactory agent I have. Two years searching for that hammer and
  no report yet. I've a good notion to kick him out and put little King Kerry
  back on the throne. A bargain's a bargain, and I've kept my part. Besides,
  I've got to have that hammer before I can make myself supreme ruler in Oz.

  Why, it's the second most important magic in the four Kingdoms!" At this
  surprising statement, Handy pricked up her ears.
 "What did you say about Kerry?" panted Nox, almost stepping into the
  quicksilver lake at mention of the little King.
 "Nothing. I was talking about Nine," scowled the Wizard. "If that fellow
  does not show some action soon, I'll C4 I'llC4" The King clenched his
  fists and looked so terribly angry that Handy was afraid he was going to
  blow bubbles again. But instead, he glared across the lake and demanded
  impatiently, "Well, if you didn't bring the silver hammer, what did you
  bring?"
 "A magic flower," explained the Goat Girl hurriedly, and before Nox could
  give away the fact that they did have the silver hammer. She could guess
  from the expression in his eye that he was about to offer the hammer in
  exchange for Kerry.
 "A flower!" bawled Wutz, his face turning from red to purple. "My caves are
  full of flowers, frosted silver lilies, long-stemmed sterling roses,
  daisies and violets with jeweled centers. I can grow any kind of flower I
  wish. How dare you take up my time with a flower! PAH! Go back and tell
  Nine he had better look out C4 he's flirting with dismissal and
  destruction."
 "But this flower saves you from injury when you fall," stammered Handy,
  heartily wishing she had never got herself into such a controversy.
 "Fall!" sneered the Silver King, simply bounding off his throne. "I NEVER
  fall!" and had hardly finished speaking before he caught his toe on a
  jutting amethyst and pitched headlong to the rocks. Horrified, and without

  waiting for the irate monarch to regain his feet, Handy and Nox began to
  run toward one of the outgoing corridors, the Goat Girl colliding as she
  ran with a plump little dignitary in a jeweled robe and high hat.
 "Your Highness! Your Highness!" puffed the little fat man, stopping long
  enough to glare at Handy Mandy. "At last our efforts are to be crowned with
  success! Five has but this moment arrived with C4 withC4"
 "With what?" demanded the King, springing lightly as a cat to his feet.
  "With a jug," exulted the little fat man, tossing his high hat into the
  air. "With a jug that was Rug and the magic picture of Queen Ozma herself."
 "Ah, SPLENDID!" beamed the monarch, who could turn his smiles and rages on
  and off like electric lights. "That will be a lesson to those Emerald
  Cityites!" Then, suddenly remembering Handy and Nox and his undignified
  fall, he shouted shrilly: "Stop those impostors! Stop them, Nifflepok, and
  lock them up in the prison pits till I have time to demolish them. Hah!
  We'll pot the Ox's tongue, make soup of his tail, saddles and boots of his
  hide, and use his head for a hat rack. As for that seven-armed monstrosity,
  she shall work in the polishing caves for the rest of her stupid life."
 "I'll polish your nose first!" promised Handy, shaking all her fists at the
  King.
 "Better come quietly," warned Nifflepok, looking so worried Handy felt a
  little sorry for him. "Wutz'll blow bubbles if you make him too mad, and
  that'll be much worse than being locked up, you know."
 "Oh, let's go with the Little High-Hat," groaned Nox, blinking his eyes at
  Handy to remind her they still had his horns and the silver hammer. "For my
  part, I'd like a little peace and quiet."
 "Take 'em away! Take 'em away!" ordered the King, stamping up and down his

  rocky island. "Send in Five! Send in Five at once!"
 "Come along, then," said Nifflepok, being careful to keep out of the way of
  Nox's horns. "Come, give me your hand, maiden. Not that one! Not THAT one!"
  he howled dismally as the Goat Girl clasped his outstretched fingers in her
  iron hand. "Let go! Let go!"
 "Let's go! Let's go!" chuckled Handy Mandy mischievously. And squealing with
  pain, the little Minister hurried them down a long, dim passageway.
  
 CHAPTER 11
 DOWN TO THE PRISONERS' PIT!
 "Oh! Oh! Give me another hand, and I'll do my best to help you," sputtered
  Nifflepok as Handy Mandy ruthlessly continued to squeeze his fingers.
 "We'll help ourselves, thank you," retorted the Goat Girl tartly. Then,
  relenting a little, she relaxed her hold, for she could not help pitying
  Nifflepok and all the subjects of this cruel King. "Where are these prison
  pits?" she asked impatiently, for she was anxious to be alone with Nox. "If
  you are going to lock us up, do hurry along with it."
 "Yes, yes, absolutely yes!" moaned Nifflepok, glancing nervously over his
  shoulder to be sure the white Ox was not going to tread on his heels.
  "You'll be there in no time, no time at all," he assured them earnestly.
  "Step over here, please." Moving a sliding door in the wall of the
  corridor, the King's assistant waved them toward a smooth, wheelless silver
  carriage. It looked to Handy a lot like an old-fashioned sleigh, and as
  there were seats in front and a space in back large enough for the Ox, she
  let go Nifflepok's hand and quite willingly climbed aboard. Nox, grunting a

  little, stepped over the side and settled himself behind her.
 "Well, goodbye," sniffed Nifflepok, rubbing his bruised fingers tenderly.
  "You'll find everything you need below, not that you'll be needing
  anything," he added mournfully as he pulled out a silver switch. "Goodbye.
  I'm sorry for you!" he shouted as the car with a lurch that almost loosened
  Handy's teeth shot down a sliding runway to the deep pits of darkness
  below.
 Now you and I, who are used to scenic railways and have enjoyed the thrills
  of chute the chutes for years, would have been less startled by the wild,
  dizzy leaps, the swoops, curves and climbs, and the sickening drops of the
  Silver King's chariot. But neither the Goat Girl nor the Royal Ox had ever
  heard of a scenic railway, much less ridden in one, and the underground car
  of the Silver Monarch was more like a chute the chutes than anything else.
  Sometimes the two travelers were in complete darkness, at other times they
  whirled by the narrow, well-lighted ledges of a queer cave city where the
  subjects of the Mountain King lived in cell-like apertures in the silver
  rock like the cliff dwellers of old. Then without warning the car would
  plunge to the work caverns below, past the gloomy shafts of the silver
  mines, or dart up to the living quarters and grottoes of the King himself,
  caves so lavishly furnished and glowing with jewels Handy let out little
  shrieks of astonishment. In the King's subterranean gardens, silver
  swallows bathed in the silver fountains, silver maples rustled their lacy
  branches in the lavender-scented breezes, silver-petalled flowers with
  jeweled centers grew as riotously as daisies and buttercups in the upstairs
  world.
 The mountaineers themselves, working listlessly with pick and shovel in the

  mines or walking soberly along the ledges beside their little cliff
  dwellings, seemed undersized and unhappy to the Goat Girl. Not that she
  caught more than a flying glimpse of them as the silver car tore by. In
  fact, she was so frantically busy holding on to the front rail of the car
  with all her various hands and catching her breath after each dizzy swoop
  that her mind was in a perfect whirl. The groans and snorts of Nox were far
  from reassuring, but afraid to look back lest she herself be flung out,
  Handy clung desperately to the rail wondering when the wild ride would end
  and where under the mountain the silver car was taking them. The last words
  of Nifflepok rang unpleasantly in her ears, and as they raced by a cave
  marked "Potters Den," the Goat Girl positively shuddered. Here, set out in
  vast silver pots and buried to their chins in the silver earth, were scores
  of the King's pale-faced prisoners. A grim-looking gardener was watering
  them from a milk can, and from the hungry way they lapped up the few drops
  that fell to them, Handy concluded that this was probably their only food.
 "First I shot over a mountain, and now I'm shooting through one!" moaned the
  distracted Goat Girl, trying to collect her spinning thoughts and
  faculties. "Oh, myC4y, we're going to pot for sure. Oh, this time we are
  really done for!"
 Then all at once Handy's good common sense began to assert itself. And as
  their strange chariot with a sudden increase of speed and power again
  dashed down into the darkness, she snatched the precious blue flower from
  her pocket and at the exact moment the silver car turned over and flung
  them into space, Handy began pulling the petals from the flower and letting
  them drift down ahead of her own rapidly falling body. It was just light

  enough for her to see Nox, with bristling horns and quivering nostrils,
  fall past, when she herself started to turn so many and such dizzy
  somersaults she lost all count of time and distance.
  
 CHAPTER 12
 PRISONERS OF THE WIZARD
 What seemed to be hours later, though in reality it was only a few moments,
  the two luckless prisoners found themselves side by side on a heap of soft
  blue flower petals. They were in a small circular pit with one amethyst
  burning dimly in the grating that covered the top. The Goat Girl had no
  recollection of her final landing and gazing up at the grilled ceiling
  wondered dully how they had come through without being cut to pieces.
 "It tilted," wheezed the Royal Ox, answering the unspoken question in
  Handy's eyes, "just tilted and slid us down.20A fortunate thing you kept
  that magic flower, m'lass. HaC4rumph!" Weakly and still trembling in every
  limb, Nox tried to rise, but his legs gave way beneath him, and for a good
  fifteen minutes he and the Goat Girl rested on the flower petals saying
  never a word. The tapping of footsteps in the corridor brought Handy
  quickly to her feet, and as Nox managed to heave himself upright the blue
  petals vanished, leaving only a tiny flower on the floor. Handy had just
  time to stuff it into her pocket when an invisible door in the side of the
  pit opened and twelve depressed workmen in silver cloth caps and overalls
  stepped inside. They carried brooms, mops and dust pans and stood staring
  in dismay at the seven-armed Goat Girl and angry-looking Ox.
 "We were sent to brush up!" stuttered the first workman, touching his cap
  uneasily. "But C4 there C4 seemsC4"

 "To be nothing to brush!" finished Handy sarcastically. "Sorry to disappoint
  you. Now get OUT!" ordered the Goat Girl furiously, and seizing buckets,
  brooms and mops from their nerveless fingers, Handy pummeled them left and
  right with her seven hands. "Get out and don't come back till Christmas,"
  she panted as the workmen, tumbling over one another, clawed open the door
  and banged it to behind them. The knob was on the other side of the door,
  and not even the edges of the door were now visible. "What a place!"
  groaned Handy Mandy, leaning dejectedly against the side of their prison.
  "What a King! And he looked so nice!" grieved the Goat Girl, sliding down
  to a sitting position and holding her head in all of her hands.
 "Never mind," said the Ox, settling on the floor beside her. "He hasn't
  gotten the best of us yet. It was pretty clever of you to remember that
  flower, but what I can't understand is why you did not tell him at once
  that we $$did&& have this silver hammer he is so anxious to possess. Then
  we could have traded the hammer for the release of Kerry."
 "I don't trust him," answered the Goat Girl somberly. "Why, I wouldn't trust
  that Wizard as far as a goat can butt. Didn't you hear him say the hammer
  was the second most important magic in Oz? Didn't you hear him say he was
  stealing and planning to steal the best magic from all the four Kingdoms to
  make himself supreme ruler of Oz? Well, now that Five has brought him this
  jug-a-rug or whatever it is and Ozma's own magic picture, he's probably
  well on the way to realizing his ambitions. But he's not going to get our
  silver hammer. I found it, and I'm going to keep it, for it's far safer
  with me than with him. Do you suppose we're going to help an old Bozzywog
  like that? What good would it do to put Kerry back on his throne if Wutz is

  to be Ruler of Oz? He'd probably pot all the Kings and keep everything for
  himself."
 "Very probably," agreed Nox, wagging his head mournfully. "But what are we
  to do? Are we an army to fight a mountain full of silver moles and minions,
  are we magicians to risk our necks with this wizard? Besides," Nox's face
  grew thin and anxious, "if Wutz has treated Kerry the way he has treated
  us, the boy needs us right now and this very minute."
 "But didn't you hear him say he'd put Kerry back on the throne if Nine did
  not soon find the hammer?" put in Handy patiently. "That proves the little
  King is still here, and safe. Of course we must find him and get him out of
  this miserable mountain, but we're not going to give Wutz our hammer or any
  help at all, and he can put that in his silver pipe and blow bubbles till
  he bursts," said Handy vindictively. "Now the thing to do is to rest and
  eat, and then set ourselves to find the way out of this pit and this
  mountain. Wutz and Nifflepok think we're all swept away by this time.
  Besides, they'll be too busy talking with Five to bother us. So first to
  eat and then to think!" proposed Handy in a businesslike manner.
 "Perhaps you're right," sighed the Ox, "but I'll not have an easy moment
  till we're out of this magic mountain. That ride!" Nox lashed his tail and
  rolled his eyes at the mere thought of their dash down the underground
  railway. "Did you ever experience anything like it in your life?"
 "Well," grinned Handy, "it's one way of seeing the country, I suppose. But
  let's not look back, old Toggins, let's look ahead. Remember, we still have
  the Dwarf of the Hammer on our side, and when we are ready to leave, he'll
  
  surely show us the way."

 "Not before I put a few gores in that Wizard's pants and plans," rumbled Nox
  belligerently. "I'll teach him to take liberties with the Royal Ox of
  Keretaria."
 "HiC4yigh! That's the old Oz spirit!" cheered Handy, reaching out to touch
  his golden horn. "Horn, dear, just serve two dinners, and no fooling."
  Unscrewing Nox's horn of plenty as she spoke, the Goat Girl held it quietly
  in her wooden hand. And there was certainly no fooling about the two
  splendid dinners the horn delivered in answer to Handy's wish. Never had
  she eaten a more appetizing repast, and half of the prison pit was taken up
  by the fresh hay, fruit and grains brought to satisfy the hunger of the
  Royal Ox. So, forgetting for a time their awful danger and their
  disagreeable imprisonment, the two adventurers refreshed themselves and,
  after the dishes and containers had disappeared, settled down to evolve
  some plan to outwit the Wizard of Wutz.
  
 CHAPTER 13
 IN THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ
 Ten days before the Goat Girl left Mt. Mern, a weary and footsore pilgrim
  arrived in the Emerald City. At least, he gave that impression to all who
  saw him shuffling with his long staff and beggar's cup along the shining
  streets of the capital. The man's head was clean shaven, and his small cap,
  coarse belted robe, and sandals marked him as a monk of some old and
  ancient order. He nodded gently to each person he passed and seemed, in
  spite of his many years and wrinkles, innocent and harmless as a child. The
  splendor and magnificence of the capital astonished and bewildered the old

  gentleman, and in a sort of stupefied disbelief he stared at the
  emerald-studded streets and houses and gazed up at the lofty peaks and
  spires of the royal palace.
 And this was not strange, for of all the fairy cities out of the world, the
  Emerald City of Oz is the most dazzling and beautiful. But its citizens are
  kindly and simple, for all that, and many stopped to drop emeralds in the
  pilgrim's cup and ask him if there was anything else that he needed. To all
  he mumbled in a strange and indistinguishable tongue, and seeing that he
  was bound for the palace and sure that Ozma herself would know best how to
  deal with him, the Emerald Cityites let him go his way unmolested.
 The afternoon was warm and pleasant, and Ozma and some of her favorites were
  having a lazy game of croquet in the royal garden. The click of the gold
  mallets as they tapped the gold balls presently attracted the attention of
  the old wayfarer, who paused to peer curiously over the hedge. The simple
  summer dresses of the girls in the garden seemed out of all keeping with
  their majestic surroundings. Except for Ozma's frock, which was longer, the
  emerald crown on her dark curls, and the golden circlets worn by her three
  companions, they might have been any four little girls playing croquet in a
  garden. But all around were the unmistakable signs of rank and royalty.
 At ease under a lime tree stood a tall soldier with green whiskers leaning
  on his gun. Three footmen in satin uniforms stood stiffly beside an
  emerald-topped tea table, ready at a moment's notice to serve Ozade and
  frosted cake. On a gold bench nearby a straw-stuffed scarecrow was quietly
  reading the paper, and walking arm in arm down a little path talking
  composedly together were an energetic little man with a bald head and a
  curious fellow who seemed to be constructed entirely of copper. To all who

  are familiar with the quaint and merry folk at Ozma's court, there would be
  nothing odd about a live scarecrow or a mechanical man, and most of us
  would have recognized Ozma's companions at once as Dorothy, Betsy and Trot,
  three mortal girls who long ago came to live in the royal palace.
 It was Dorothy who had discovered the Scarecrow on her first visit to Oz,
  lifting him down from his pole and traveling in his gay and carefree
  company all the way to the Emerald City. In those days, the Wizard of Oz
  had been ruler of the country, he himself having flown in a balloon from
  Omaha. Astonished by the circus tricks of this little fellow, the Ozians,
  believing him to be a real wizard, made him their sovereign, and under his
  wise rule and direction built the now famous City of Emeralds. The sight of
  Dorothy had made the humbug wizard homesick, and after presenting the
  Scarecrow with a fine set of brains, he flew off to America in a balloon of
  his own construction, leaving the straw man to rule in his place.
 Afterward, when Ozma was disenchanted and proved to be the rightful ruler of
  Oz, the Scarecrow had cheerfully resigned. But he still spends most of his
  time in the palace and is one of Ozma's most trusted friends and
  counselors. Later, the Wizard himself returned to Oz and this time took up
  the study of magic with such zeal and earnestness he was soon famous from
  one end of the country to the other. This made him exceedingly valuable to
  the young fairy ruler, and he, like the Scarecrow, is an old and honored
  member of Ozma's cabinet.
 It was the Wizard who was now talking so earnestly to Tik Tok. The Metal Man
  was another of Dorothy's discoveries. She met Tik Tok on her second visit
  to Oz and brought him to the Emerald City for safekeeping. Tik Tok, made by

  the firm of Smith and Tinker, is a completely mechanical man and a loyal
  and dependable citizen when he is properly wound up and oiled. Betsy and
  Trot, like Dorothy, arrived more or less by wind, wave and accident in the
  Land of Oz. They liked it so well and proved so gay and amusing that Ozma
  begged them to stay with her and Dorothy in the green castle and help rule
  the many merry Kingdoms that make up her wonderful empire. This they were
  only too happy to do, so here they are, Princesses in their own right and
  living in the most gorgeous City out of the world.
 Besides the celebrities in the garden, there are numerous other important
  people at Ozma's court. For instance, there is Herby, the Medicine Man,
  whose chest is really a medicine chest full of pills, cures and ointments.
  Then there is Scraps, a lively girl made from a patchwork quilt by a
  wizard's wife and brought to life by the wizard; and there's Pigasus, a
  flying pig. There's a doubtful dromedary, a cowardly lion, a hungry tiger,
  and Dorothy's little dog Toto; a glass cat belonging to Scraps, a wooden
  sawhorse belonging to Ozma, an Iffin whom Jack Pumpkinhead discovered near
  the Land of Barons, and a dozen more unique and unusual characters. The old
  pilgrim seemed to find the group in the garden surprising enough, for he
  watched them closely and silently for almost ten minutes, cupping his hand
  behind his ear in an endeavor to catch what the Wizard was saying.
 "It is just as I have told you," the little Wizard was remarking earnestly
  to Tik Tok. "The great record book of Glinda has vanished from her castle
  without trace or reason, and even with my powerful searchlight and looking
  glasses I have been unable to discover any signs of it. Word of the theft
  came yesterday by pigeon post."
 "Some-one has sto-len it for no good pur-pose," answered the Metal Man

  solemnly. But the old man leaning over the hedge heard none of this, for
  the two were conversing in low and guarded tones. So after a long, puzzled
  look at the Scarecrow, the pilgrim took up his staff and shuffled along the
  gold-pebbled path to the palace itself. A pompous footman in gold and green
  came to answer his timid knock at the door.
 "What name, please, what business, and why in the wood (sic) does a fellow
  like you come begging at the door of a castle?" inquired the footman in a
  loud, displeased voice.
 "There, there, Puffup," admonished a rosy-cheeked maid in a ribboned cap and
  apron, peering around the wide shoulders of the footman. "Don't be so
  shouting proud. You've frightened the old gentleman half out of his wits.
  Can't you see he is tired and hungry and probably in need of a lunch?" At
  the little maid's kind speech, the pilgrim bowed at least a dozen times,
  nodding his head energetically to show that she was perfectly right in her
  conjecture. "Come along with you," urged Jellia Jamb, giving him a friendly
  wink.
 Edging nervously past the muttering footman, the old beggar followed Jellia
  into the castle's spacious and splendid dining hall. "Wait right here, and
  I'll bring you some cake and applesauce, an omelette and a pot of tea,"
  promised the obliging girl. "How will that be?" Jellia Jamb, who was Ozma's
  own personal maid and a privileged character around the castle, grinned
  cheerfully at her ancient visitor, and though the old monk pretended not to
  understand a word that she said, he nevertheless seated himself at the
  table and with round eyes watched her skip through the swinging door into
  the pantry.

 No sooner had Jellia disappeared than the old rascal sprang nimbly to his
  feet and began to peer eagerly all around him. Passing hurriedly over a
  rich gold service on the sideboard, he pounced upon an earthen jug on a
  crystal stand and, tucking it under his robe, slipped silently as a shadow
  out of the dining hall, up the green carpeted stairs and straight into the
  private sitting room of Ozma of Oz. Once there and without losing a moment,
  he walked to the west wall, took down a large gold-framed picture, blew
  upon it with a small glass tube till it was no larger than a cake of
  chocolate, and thrust it into an inner pocket. Then, holding his robe high
  above his skinny shins and with the jug clasped tightly in his arms, he
  galloped down the stairs and out an open window into the garden, reaching a
  large clump of snowball bushes without encountering anyone.
 Hiding himself well in the bushes, he tore off the monk's robe, turned it
  inside out, dragged a white wig from his sock, and presently emerged as
  dignified and plausible an old grandmother as anyone would wish to see. The
  other side of his monk's robe was green and made up in a style much
  affected by old ladies in the capital, so that now he attracted no
  attention whatever. The jug in a large string bag dangled carelessly from
  his wrist, and smiling and nodding amiably, he hurried through the garden,
  passed rapidly down one street and another, through the city gates on and
  on, till he was far out in the country, walking faster and faster and less
  like a monk or an old lady at every step.
  
 CHAPTER 14
 THE ROBBERY IS DISCOVERED!
 "Prunes and peppermints!" ejaculated the Scarecrow, springing up from his

  bench as Jellia Jamb, with streaming eyes and cap ribbons, came flying
  across the garden.
 "Peanuts and pretzels!" Dorothy, about to hit the pole and win the game,
  dropped her mallet at Jellia's fire-siren screeches, while Ozma and the
  others swung round in amazement as the little waiting maid, sobbing and
  panting, rushed into their midst.
 "Oh, that beggar! Oh, that pilgrim! That old Monk, or whatever he was!"
  wailed Jellia, wiping her eyes on the corner of her apron. "He's gone and
  stolen the jug, I mean Rug, and Oz knows what will become of us!"
 "There, there, my girl. Stop crying! Begin at the beginning and tell us just
  what happened," begged the Scarecrow, patting Jellia clumsily on the
  shoulder.
 "But this is serious, very serious," muttered the Wizard, who had at once
  realized the importance of the little maid's news. "If Ruggedo is released
  from that jug and enchantment, he'll be up to his old tricks in no time and
  doing anything in his power to hurt and destroy us."
 "But who could have known we turned Ruggedo into a jug, or where the jug was
  kept? And why would anyone steal an old earthenware pitcher when there are
  so many other rare and beautiful objects in the palace?" Ozma, looking
  anxious and troubled, seated herself on the bench beside the Scarecrow.
 "The same person who knew the value of Glinda's record book and stole that,"
  answered the Wizard gloomily. "Dark forces are at work in Oz, my dear, dark
  forces. Just how did this rascal look, Jellia?"
 "Like an old monk with a beggar's cup," said the little maid with a
  sorrowful sniff. "He seemed so poor and hungry I went off to get him

  something to eat, and no sooner was my back turned than he grabbed the jug
  and ran off C4 though he shuffled slowly enough when he came into the
  palace."
 "Disguised, of course," observed the Scarecrow, raising one eyebrow, "and no
  more a monk than I am. But what was he monkeying around here for? And what
  could he want with that jug, even if he knew it was the old Gnome King?
  Really, you know, you shouldn't let perfect strangers into the palace,
  Jellia."
 "Just what I was telling her," wheezed Puffup, breathlessly adding himself
  to the group on the lawn, "and I hopes this will be a lesson to you, Miss."
 "If we just knew where the old villain came from," worried the Wizard,
  tapping his fingers absently on Tik Tok's copper arm.
 "Or where he was going," finished Dorothy, pushing back her crown.
 "Why not look in the ma-gic pic-ture?" proposed the Machine Man calmly. "The
  pic-ture would show us where he is now."
 "Of course it would!" Ozma rewarded Tik Tok with a bright smile, and jumping
  up, the little Fairy hurried across the garden and into the palace with the
  others just a few steps behind here. But when they reached the small
  sitting room where the magic picture was hung, of course it was not there,
  and now in real distress and consternation they all sat down to discuss the
  mysterious forces working against them.
 "I thought Ruggedo was the only enemy I had left," sighed Ozma, leaning
  wearily back in her satin tufted armchair. "I thought when we turned the
  Gnome King to a jug all our troubles would be over."
 "Who-ev-er stole the jug knows that Rug-ge-do was once the pow-er-ful me-tal
  mon-arch who tried a-gain and a-gain to con-quer Oz," rasped Tik Tok in his

  slow and precise fashion.
 "Right!" agreed the Wizard, striding up and down with his hands clasped
  behind his back. "And whoever stole that jug and the magic picture plans to
  disenchant the Gnome King and learn from him the best way to destroy us.
  But that will be pretty difficult," asserted the little Wizard, thrusting
  out his chin. "That transformation was one of the best you ever made, my
  dear Ozma, one of the best. It will take a pretty smart wizard to turn that
  jug back to Rug again."
 "Whoever stole the jug and Ozma's magic picture WAS pretty smart," Betsy
  Bobbin reminded him seriously. "And without the picture, how're we going to
  find out who it is? Can't you do something, Wiz dear, or do we just have to
  sit around and wait to be conquered?"
 "I shall go to my laboratory at once," decided the Wizard importantly, "and
  there by some magic means I'll try to discover who is at the bottom of all
  this wretched plotting and thievery. Lock up the magic treasures in your
  safe, Ozma, especially the Gnome King's magic belt, and have them guarded
  day and night." Briskly, the little Wizard rushed out of the room,
  returning in a moment to repeat gloomily, "DAY and NIGHT!"
 "And I'll go and drill the army," declared the Scarecrow, stepping
  recklessly out an open French window and falling flat, but undaunted, in a
  flower bed below.
 "And I'd better call Tige and the Cowardly Lion," said Dorothy, who had
  always found the lion a splendid fighter in spite of his cowardice, and the
  Hungry Tiger, ready at the drop of a handkerchief to protect his royal
  patrons with tooth and claw. "They can sit right here beside the safe, and

  I'd just like to see anyone get by them!"
 "Maybe it will be someone they cannot see," shivered Betsy, peering out into
  the darkening garden.
 "Oh, my, isn't it too exciting!" Trot, bouncing up and down on a small sofa,
  leaned over to touch Ozma on the knee. "It reminds me of the time Ugu the
  Shoemaker stole all the magic treasures in Oz. Remember?"
 Ozma, looking at the space where her magic picture had hung, nodded her head
  sorrowfully, saddened and sobered by the thought that she still had
  dangerous and unscrupulous enemies in Oz.
  
 CHAPTER 15
 THE PILGRIM RETURNS TO THE MOUNTAIN
 Traveling northward by foot and as quickly as he could, Number Five had come
  to the Silver King's Mountain just a few moments after Nox and Handy Mandy.
  Now dressed in the silver armor and helmet worn by all the Wizard's M-Men,
  he waited in great agitation for the wizard to appear. Nifflepok had at
  once taken Five to the den where Wutz carried on all his magic experiments
  and kept his valuable treasures, and quite sure none of the other agents
  had been as successful as he, Five paced impatiently up and down, fancying
  himself already co-ruler with the wizard in Oz.
 "So, there you are at last!" Entering from an invisible door in the back of
  his workshop, Wutz stared coldly at Five. "Well, what trash is that you
  have stolen?" he asked finally. The wizard always pretended the discoveries
  of his agents were of little use and importance. And when Five, completely
  taken aback and crestfallen, began to explain the wonderful properties of
  the magic picture and the fact that the old jug had once been the powerful

  King of the Gnomes, the Silver Monarch cut him short. "Yes, yes, but just
  see what Seven has brought," he told him gloatingly. "Seven, by a trick
  known only to himself, has stolen and transported to our mountain the great
  record book of Glinda the Good Sorceress!" Following the direction of the
  King's imperious finger, Five gazed jealously at a huge volume chained with
  golden chains to its marble stand. "In that book," went on the wizard
  quickly, "everything that ever happened in Oz is recorded, not only
  everything that has happened, but everything that is happening. You can see
  the entries appearing at this very minute on the open page."
 "I see, I see!" Five scarcely glanced at the record book. "But this magic
  picture shows you any person you desire to look at. With this picture and
  the help of the powerful Gnome King, now disguised as a jug, we can soon
  make ourselves rulers of Oz. All we need to do is release Ruggedo from his
  enchantment. I have been told by people in the Emerald City that Ruggedo is
  familiar with all the magic secrets of Ozma and the Wizard of Oz, and is,
  besides, a skillful magician himself. Once we have disenchanted him,
  everything will be easy."
 "We? We?" sneered Wutz, who secretly agreed with Five, but would not give
  him the satisfaction of knowing it. "Well, put the picture there on that
  stand so I can examine it. Show us this silly ruler of Oz who sets herself
  above all other rulers," he ordered sharply. "Where is she now, and what is
  she doing?" Then, though the wizard and Five and Nifflepok, who had come
  noiselessly into the workshop, gazed into the canvas till their eyes stung
  and watered, not a single figure appeared to enlighten them. "HAH! A hoax!"
  raged the Silver King, rushing at Five and shaking him till his armor

  rattled. "How dare you fool me in this dangerous manner?"
 "But it's not a hoax," screamed Five as soon as he could speak. "It worked
  perfectly well in the castle."
 "Perhaps it was hurt when you reduced it to carry it here," put in Nifflepok
  nervously. He was always trying to keep peace between the cruel King and
  his subjects. "Perhaps it only obeys the commands of Ozma, its rightful
  owner. And remember, you still have the jug and the magic record book. The
  record book might explain about the picture," he suggested hopefully. "I
  thought so. It says here: `The magic picture and Rug, the jug, have been
  stolen from the castle of Ozma of Oz by an agent of the Silver King.' "
 "There!" exclaimed Five, brushing himself off indignantly. "I told you it
  was the one and only picture."
 "Yes, but what good is it to me if it doesn't work?" scoffed the wizard.
  "I'll not have you potted this time, Five, but next time don't bring me
  damaged goods and old jugs. Bring something of real value." As Five,
  red-faced and furious, jerked himself out of the King's presence, Wutz
  turned joyfully to Nifflepok. "Getting on, old Tubbykins, we're getting on!
  Without that magic picture, Ozma will not be able to trace her stolen
  property, and without the record book, Glinda will not be able to help her.
  So who's to stop us from stealing everything? Everything!" exulted Wutz,
  picking up the earthen jug and waving it over his head.
 "But do you think it wise to treat our agents so shabbily?" sighed
  Nifflepok. "They might betray us, you know."
 "Oh, no, they won't," sniffed the wizard, grinning broadly at his anxious
  little assistant. "The way I treat them is perfectly all right, keeps them
  on their toes, and with each trying to outdo the other we get the best

  results."
 "Well, I hope you're right," Nifflepok still looked unconvinced. "But I
  cannot help thinkingC4"
 "Out of your line, Niffy; just leave the thinking to me. Now fetch me my
  magic blower, there's a good fellow, till I see what can be done with this
  jug. It may take some time and doing to release this ugly little gnome. By
  the way, did you pulverize those meddling Munchkins?"
 "Oh, yes!" Nifflepok nodded his head with a little shudder of distaste. "I
  shot them down into the prisoner's pit just as your Majesty commanded."
 "That's strange." The wizard in crossing the den to fetch a glass test tube
  had paused for a moment beside the book of records. "It says here, `The
  Goat Girl from Mern and the Royal Ox are in the Silver King's Mountain
  planning to release the little King of Kereteria.' So that's what brought
  them here," mused the wizard softly. "Now then, Nifflepok, something must
  have slipped up instead of down. If your prisoners were powdered or
  pulverized, how could they be planning and plotting?"
 "They must have some powerful magic to help them," muttered Nifflepok, "or
  how could they have survived that fall?"
 "Better find out, my dear fellow. Go spy on those Munchkins, and if their
  magic is important or worthwhile, come back and tell me. And in the future
  be more careful how you carry out my orders and instructions!" The wizard's
  voice was still low and pleasant, but his eyes flashed so threateningly
  that Nifflepok rushed out of the royal work den, flung himself in the
  silver car, and went speeding down to the prison pits at the bottom of the
  mountain.

  
 CHAPTER 16
 THE WIZARD'S BARGAIN!
 While Nifflepok had been interviewing Five, Handy and Nox had been having a
  troublesome conference of their own. Each plan they devised for finding the
  little King and escaping from the Silver King's Mountain proved
  impractical. To summon the hammer elf to release them from the prison pit
  would probably rouse the underground guards and minions of the wizard and
  give Wutz himself an opportunity to steal the hammer. To tap the hammer
  lightly and ask the advice of Himself had next seemed a good idea, but as
  Nox quickly pointed out, that, too, was dangerous. "In a wizard's den like
  this, anything can happen," groaned the Ox, looking around with a gloomy
  eye. "How do we know we are not being watched at this very moment? If you
  so much as show that hammer, somebody may pounce in here and snatch it
  away, which will leave us with nothing to protect ourselves with in a last
  emergency C4 except that blue flower, my horns, and your hands."
 Handy did not like the sound of "last emergency," but even Handy realized
  they would not escape from the mountain without some sort of battle. To the
  free and sun-loving mountain girl, every minute underground was sheer
  torture. She longed for a breath of the pure upper air, and the unreal
  light and pale faces of Wutz's underground citizens and workers filled her
  with pity and loathing. "Of course, no matter how long they leave us here,
  your horn of plenty will keep us from starving, but if we don't soon find
  some way out, I believe I'll explode!" she choked in a desperate voice.
 "Let's look at the message in that silver ball again," suggested Nox
  unexpectedly. "Are you sure you read it all, m'lass? There might have been

  directions on the other side."
 "I don't think so," said Handy, shaking her head. Then, because action of
  any sort was a relief, she deftly twisted off Nox's left horn and tilted
  the silver balls into one of her always handy palms. The first ball when
  she opened it contained nothing further than the silver key. In the center
  of the second lay the same folded paper, but this time when Handy unfolded
  the paper there was a new message inside.
 "Wait!" cautioned the little slip of paper in small blue letters. "Do
  nothing until the wizard appears."
 "Oh," breathed the Royal Ox, touching the paper gently with his nose.
  "Someone is helping us."
 "Then I'd better keep this silver ball in my pocket," decided the Goat Girl,
  "where I can easily get it. In a tight corner I might not have a chance to
  unscrew your horn. DearC4ear, how puzzling it all grows! So we're to hear
  from the wizard again. Whist! What was that?" As Handy, with her wooden
  hand, slipped the first ball back into the horn, with her leather hand
  screwed the horn back on Nox's head, and with one of her best white hands
  stuffed the second ball and message into her pocket, they heard agitated
  footsteps pattering along the outside corridor. After a tense moment,
  however, they died away, and exchanging a relieved glance, Nox and Handy
  settled down to wait for the wizard.
 The footsteps, as you have already guessed, belonged to Nifflepok. Peering
  in at them through an invisible window, the King's messenger had been just
  in time to see Handy shaking the silver balls from the golden horn. Without
  waiting to see what use they would make of this curious magic, Nifflepok

  rushed back to inform his master. "They are wizards!" he panted, bursting
  unceremoniously into the Silver King's den. "The magic is in the ox's horn.
  With my own eyes I saw the seven-armed maiden shaking silver balls from his
  horn."
 "What do $$I&& care about silver balls?" snarled Wutz, who was in a terrible
  temper. "If I had them here, I'd bounce you over the head with them." The
  den was full of sulphurous smoke, but the earthenware jug still stood
  unchanged on the table before him. "The magic in the Emerald City is still
  better than mine," hissed the Silver Monarch, his voice quivering with
  anger and disappointment. "I've tried every single formula in my book of
  incantations, every straight and crooked pass in the magician's manual,
  every powder and potion on my shelves, and this ugly jug is still a jug and
  nothing but a jug! What are we going to do?" he yelled furiously. "Think of
  something, you noddle-headed pig! I must have the help of this little Gnome
  King, but how'm I going to get him out of the jug?"
 "Perhaps, with a little more time," faltered Nifflepok, twisting his high
  hat nervously in his hands.
 "Time! TIME!" exploded the wizard. "When did time ever break an
  enchantment?" Snatching up a pair of silver pliers, he flung them
  wrathfully at his assistant. Nifflepok, fortunately for his head, caught
  the dangerous missile in his hat and, darting behind a tall cabinet, looked
  pleadingly out at his unreasonable Master.
 "Wait! Wait!" he begged earnestly as Wutz, with a menacing frown, took up
  his silver bubble pipe. "I HAVE thought of something. Make these Munchkins
  break the Gnome King's enchantment. They have passed all the hazards of our
  mountain unharmed. Undoubtedly the girl is a sorceress and the Ox a

  powerful magician in disguise. Let them do this trifling service for your
  Majesty in return for the useless captive we are holding for Number Nine."
 "HmC4mmmm!" Deliberately, the Silver Monarch put down his pipe. "That's not
  a bad idea, Niffle, not a bad idea at all." Picking up the jug, Wutz
  brushed rudely by his trembling little Minister and hurried out of his
  workshop. A few minutes later, he stood bowing and smiling before the two
  travelers in the prisoner's pit. But warned by the message in the silver
  ball, his entrance through the invisible door neither frightened nor
  impressed Handy Mandy or the Royal Ox.
 "So here you are at last," exclaimed the Goat Girl, looking the Silver
  Monarch sternly in the eye. "And about time, too. How dare you imprison us
  in this miserable pit for no reason at all?"
 "Oh, yes, there is a reason," stated Wutz, a little surprised at Handy's
  defiance. "You broke into my mountain without invitation or permission, and
  as you are nothing but a pair of trespassers, you certainly deserve
  imprisonment and even destruction."
 "Nonsense," snorted the Royal Ox, lurching forward heavily. "We came here
  seeking a lost boy whom you are unlawfully holding captive. As soon as you
  release the little King of Keretaria, we will take him and leave this
  mountain!"
 "And the sooner you tell us where he is, the better!" added Handy, snapping
  her thirty-five fingers under the Silver King's nose.
 "Ah, you think so?" sneered Wutz. "Well, nothing is ever given for nothing
  in this mountain, but I may give you a chance to earn the boy's release.
  Here in my hand is a jug, an ordinary enough looking jug. With the magic

  you have in your possession, you must transform this jug to its proper
  shape. If you succeed, you and the Ox and the Boy King of Keretaria may
  leave my mountain unharmed. If you fail, ha ha!" The heartless wizard threw
  back his head and laughed uproariously. "If you fail, the walls of this pit
  will contract until you are C4 well, shall we say obliterated? To keep
  your part of the bargain and perform this slight service, I will give you
  $$one half hour.&& Here is the jug, and in case you fail, GOODBYE!"
 "Good Gillikins!" whistled Nox as the wizard strode through the invisible
  door and left them alone. "What does that fool think we are, wizards,
  magicians, necromancers?" Groaning and snorting, he began to gallop round
  and round the hot little pit.
 "Look out! Look out! You'll break the jug," warned Handy, snatching it up in
  her arms. "And for goat's sake stop that galloping! I'm dizzy enough as it
  is."
 "But you heard what he said?" lowed the Ox, coming to a trembling stop
  beside her. "What are we to do? We know nothing of magic or magic
  transformations!" In their distress and excitement, they both forgot there
  might be a message to help them in the silver ball, and Handy, taking the
  jug in one of her white hands, surveyed it with horror and curiosity.
 "It's so old and ugly now," said the Goat Girl slowly, "I'll bet it was
  something old and ugly to begin with. Didn't Nifflepok mention something
  about a jug that was a rug? Maybe it's a rug, though more likely a rogue.
  Say, I wonder if I broke the jug whether that would not break the
  enchantment?"
 "Oh, no, no, no! Don't do that!" begged Nox, rolling his eyes in terror. "If
  you break the jug, the wizard will be furious, and how do you know what

  will break the spell? Here, let me look at it." Passing the jug rapidly
  from one hand to another, Handy started to place it on the floor under
  Nox's nose with her seventh and last hand when a sudden and unexpected
  scream from the interior made her drop it with a loud crash to the silver
  stones.
 "Ouch! Oh, stop! How dare you bang me around in this hateful manner?" Up
  from the flying fragments of earthenware at Handy's feet sprang a fierce
  little gnome with a long, ragged beard, shaking his fists and howling like
  a child.
 "Oh, myC4y! I've actually done it!" quavered the Goat Girl, falling over
  Nox. "Look! Look! Didn't I tell you it would be old and ugly?" The gnome,
  at Handy's words, suddenly stopped howling.
 "Where am I? Where am I? WHO am I?" he mumbled in a frightened voice.
 "Well, I don't know who you are, but I'm afraid you're in a pretty bad
  place," said Handy, straightening up to have a better look at her
  handiwork. "You're in the underground caverns of the King of the Silver
  Mountain, if you must know."
 "Caverns!" beamed the gnome, his face breaking into a wide smile. "What's
  the matter with caverns? I LOVE caverns. Why, I used to live in one myself.
  And who did you say I was?"
 "We don't know who you are," explained Nox in a cautious voice. "A moment
  ago and before Handy took you in hand, you were nothing but a jug."
 "A jug?" pondered the gnome, pulling his beard thoughtfully. "You mean to
  say I was a JUG?"
 "Maybe `Was-a-jug' is your name," volunteered the Goat Girl, now quite

  interested in her transformation.
 "No, not `Was-a-jug,' but something like a jug. Let me think: bug, hug,
  chug, mug, pug, rug. RUG? That's it, THAT'S my name, $$Ruggedo!&&" shrieked
  the little gnome joyfully, "And now I know who I am!"
 "Well, who are you?" inquired the Ox, stretching his royal nose down toward
  the whirling gnome.
 "I, why, $$I&& am the most important King on the other side of the desert!"
  shouted Ruggedo exultantly. "I am the one and only Metal Monarch and Ruler
  of all the Gnomes! My caves and caverns under the mountains of Ev sparkle
  with jewels and precious stones, mined by my faithful workers, and my grand
  army of gnomes outnumbers any army in Oz." Proudly, the ragged little King
  thumped himself upon the chest.
 "Oh, my! Oh, me! Oh, mercyC4ercy! If you're as powerful as all that, maybe
  you'll help us!" cried the Goat Girl, clasping her hands eagerly.
 "Help you? Why should I help you?" The little Gnome stared scornfully at the
  two occupants of the cave.
 "Because she broke your jug and enchantment, you ungrateful little wretch!"
  snorted Nox, lowering his horns. "And you don't look like a king to me, you
  just look like a plain, ordinary, wicked little ragamuffin, a RUGAMUFFIN!"
  he bellowed angrily.
  
 CHAPTER 17
 OUT OF THE PRISON PIT
 Nox's angry words had a strange effect on the boastful Gnome King. Leaning
  dejectedly against the side of the pit, he drew his hand wearily across his
  forehead. "I remember now," he told them hoarsely. "I once was the powerful

  Metal Monarch, but that was before I fell into the hands of Ozma and that
  wicked Wizard of Oz."
 "So it was Ozma who turned you to a jug!" exclaimed Handy with all her hands
  on her hips.
 "Yes, and before that she deprived me of my Kingdom, ducked me in a Truth
  Pond, marooned me for years on a desert island, struck me dumb, and then,
  when she could think of nothing worse, turned me to this jug!" screamed
  Ruggedo, kicking at the fragments of broken china at his feet.
 "You and Ozma must have been enemies for a long time, then?" observed the
  Ox, looking at the Gnome with great disfavor.
 "Yes, yes, ever since that girl Dorothy stole my magic belt and gave it to
  Ozma," raged Ruggedo, stamping furiously up and down. "And every time I try
  to recover my own property, or capture those wretched girls and the Emerald
  City, something goes wrong, and they conquer ME! The last time, Ozma turned
  me to a jug!" cried Ruggedo, his voice rising to a shrill whistle.
 "Well, what did you expect?" inquired Handy Mandy sharply. "That Ozma would
  sit calmly on her throne and allow you to conquer her? MyC4y, such goings
  on!"
 "Oh, then you are friends of Ozma?" said the Gnome King suspiciously. "But
  no, you could not be her friends or you would not have broken the jug. Who
  ARE you? The Ox is usual enough, except for his golden horns, but you" C4
  Ruggedo's eyes grew round and anxious as he looked at the seven-armed Goat
  Girl C4"$$YOU&& are odd, aren't you?"
 "No, she's not odd!" snapped the Royal Ox severely. He had been through so
  much with the sturdy mountain lass, he felt almost as if they were related.

  "Handy is just seven times as smart and seven times as handy as most
  people, that's all. And since her seven hands have served you pretty well,
  try to keep a civil tongue in your head, will you?"
 "Oh, all right!" Ruggedo, scuffing his foot, looked sulkily from one to the
  other. "Much obliged, I'm sure. But what in rockets are we doing in this
  miserable hole, and what are we waiting for?"
 "For a fellow Metal Monarch and Wizard,"20answered a smooth voice, and
  appearing as quietly as he had vanished, Wutz stood calmly before them.
  "Come with me, Ruggedo. I have surprising news for you, comrade!" And
  without so much as a nod or "thank you" to Nox and Handy Mandy, he linked
  his arm through the Gnome's and drew him through the invisible door,
  slamming it viciously behind him.
 "HiC4yi!" yelled Handy Mandy indignantly. "Come back here! Come back here!
  A bargain's a bargain, you old cheat and villain! We've kept our part, and
  you shall keep yours. Where have you hidden the little King of Kereteria?
  Let us out! Let us out, you false-faced rascal!"
 Nox, as angry as Handy, charged forward, butting his head against the exact
  spot where the wizard had disappeared. To his astonishment and joy, the
  whole section of wall swung outward, and he and the Goat Girl, rushing
  through, found themselves in a narrow, dimly lit silver tunnel. "To think,
  to think we could have got out any time!" gulped the Royal Ox in a vexed
  voice. "The door was invisible but not locked. Imagine that, m'lass!"
 "Oh, I've other things to do," puffed Handy, peering down the long
  passageway to see whether she could catch a glimpse of the two Kings. "No
  use trying to imagine anything about this mountain, it's just plain
  bewitched and goblinish. But that wizard made us a promise, and I'm going

  to see that he keeps it. Come on!"
 "No! No!" said the Royal Ox, leaning weakly against the side of the tunnel.
  "I couldn't bear to look at him again, at least not just yet. Wait! I may
  think of something else! WAIT!" bellowed Nox as Handy, in spite of his
  pleas, started off on a run. "There now, you've dropped something out of
  your pocket."
 "That silver ball," muttered Handy, scooping it up without slackening her
  pace.
 "The ball! The $$BALL?&&" exclaimed Nox, galloping breathlessly to catch up
  with her. "Oh, what muddleheads, $$WHAT&& muddleheads! It told us to wait
  for the wizard. Quick, see what it says now!"
 "Well, a lot of good it did waiting for that wizard," grumbled the Goat
  Girl; but nevertheless, she stopped and opened the silver ball. Taking out
  the folded paper, she held it up toward an amethyst gleaming dully in the
  side of the tunnel.
 "Follow me," directed the paper rather mysteriously.
 "But who does `me' mean?" asked Handy as Nox, still breathing heavily, read
  the message over her shoulder. "I don't see any me, do you? Beans and
  butternuts! If you hadn't stopped me, I'd have caught those villains by
  this time!"
 "And what good would that have done?" sniffed the Ox impatiently. "Remember,
  there are two of them now, and that little gnome is worse than Wutz and
  twice as dangerous." Closing his eyes in an effort to concentrate, Nox
  repeated over the message, "Follow me! Follow me! Follow ME! Why, of
  course, it's as plain as oats!" he snorted joyfully. "FF20`Me' means that

  ball. Put the message back in the ball, set the ball down, and then see
  what happens." And what happened was amazing enough, for the silver ball,
  once it was on the floor of the tunnel, began to roll rapidly along ahead
  of them, faster and faster and faster, till Handy and Nox had all they
  could do to keep it in sight.
 "Where do you suppose it's taking us?" gasped the Goat Girl, thankful that
  so far the tunnel had been more or less straight and fairly well lighted.
 "To Kerry," said the Royal ox positively. "Now watch that turn, m'lass.
  What's ahead? It's growing so dark I can't even see my own shadow!"
 "It's a flight of steps," whispered Handy, gazing fearfully into the deep
  well of a circular stairway winding down into the darkness. They could hear
  the chink of the silver ball as it rolled from step to step, so, taking her
  courage in all hands, the Goat Girl herself began to descend. Nox, grunting
  and muttering lugubriously, came just behind her. Steps were difficult
  enough for the Ox at any time, but negotiating a flight of circular steps
  in pitch darkness was terrifying and dangerous in the extreme. "Be
  careful!" warned Handy, looking up anxiously. "Don't slip, or you'll break
  my heart."
 "More than that, I'm afraid," quavered the Royal Ox, setting his front feet
  cautiously on the step below while he balanced his hindquarters perilously
  on the one above.
  
 CHAPTER 18
 WUTZ AND THE GNOME KING LEAVE FOR THE CAPITAL!
 Meanwhile, Wutz and Ruggedo had shot up in the wizard's silver car and were
  now in earnest conversation together. "How in suds did that girl break your

  enchantment?" asked Wutz, dropping irritably to his silver workbench. "I
  was watching her every minute through an invisible window, and I didn't see
  her do a thing but break the jug. Now why couldn't I have thought of that?"
 "Oh, what does it matter?" Ruggedo settled himself with a joyful little
  wriggle beside the Silver Monarch. "What does it matter so long as I am
  free and able to help you? So you really think you can make yourself Ruler
  of Oz?" he went on, glancing enviously round the wizard's well-stocked den
  with its tables full of magic apparatus and its shelves and shelves of
  dusty volumes of wizard and witch works. Wutz had confided his plans and
  intentions to Ruggedo on the ride up. "Say!" exclaimed the Gnome King
  suddenly, "How did you get Glinda's record book? That's the most important
  treasure in her castle!"
 "Of course!" Lazily, the wizard reached for his silver pipe. "Well, it's a
  long story, Rug, but I don't mind telling you that I have agents working in
  every Kingdom of the country. Seven, who was assigned to the Quadling
  Country, brought in the record book, smallifying it in order to steal and
  carry it here and restoring it to proper size when it arrived. Six and
  Eleven have brought me useful magic from the Winkies and Gillikins, but
  Five managed to steal Ozma's own magic picture, and C4 ha ha! C4 since he
  couldn't find the Gnome King's belt, he brought me the Gnome King himself!
  Pretty clever of him to discover you were a jug, eh?"
 "Remarkable!" sighed Ruggedo as Wutz paused to blow a silver bubble which
  floated out of the work den, breaking somewhere outside with a tinkling,
  bell-like explosion.
 "Two glasses of melted silver," snapped the wizard to a smart-looking

  bellboy who came in answer to this singular summons. "Now," continued Wutz,
  looking at the Gnome King through half-closed eyes, "before I attempt to
  capture the Emerald City, I must have one of two things: either the silver
  hammer belonging to a witch of the West, or the magic belt that once
  belonged to you. So far, none of my agents has been able to find the witch,
  locate the hammer, or discover where Ozma now keeps your magic belt. But
  you, its rightful owner, must know exactly where it is hidden."
 Ruggedo, without saying anything, nodded briefly. "Well then," said Wutz,
  "if you will help me steal the magic belt, which I understand is the most
  potent and powerful magic in Ev or Oz, I will kick Kaliko off your throne,
  restore your own Kingdom, and give you besides any one of the four Oz
  Kingdoms you may fancy."
 "Oh, don't bother me with any of the Oz Kingdoms. I'm sick of the place!"
  frowned the Gnome, wagging his beard vindictively. "All I want is my own
  old Kingdom and my own magic belt! But I tell you what I will do. I'll help
  you steal this belt, for I know exactly where it is hidden, show you how it
  works so you can transform Ozma and all her friends and counselors to rocks
  and rubble. BUT, when you are safely established as supreme Wizard of Oz,
  you must return the belt to me."
 "Oh, naturally!" promised the wizard, chuckling to himself as he thought how
  quickly he would turn Ruggedo to a rock once he was wearing the famous
  belt. Taking a glass of melted silver from the tray the boy had just set
  down, Wutz lifted it to his lips, and Ruggedo, his eyes glittering with all
  their old spitefulness, raised his own glass to drink to the wicked
  bargain.
 "Come," he sputtered, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. "When do we

  start? What magic have you to carry us to the capital and open the emerald
  safe where the magic belt and other important treasures of Ozma are hidden?
  But wait, perhaps we had better look in the magic picture and see where
  Ozma and the Wizard of Oz are now."
 "I am afraid we cannot do that," Wutz explained regretfully. "Seven spoiled
  the canvas in some way when he reduced it to carry it here. It doesn't show
  anything now, and I've not had time to repair the damage."
 "Pshaw, that's too bad," said Ruggedo, going over to touch the picture, now
  hanging on the wizard's wall. "But the record book is still working, I
  suppose."
 "Oh, yes," said the wizard, stepping up to the marble table and glancing
  down at the open page. "And listen to this. It says," roared the Silver
  King, holding his sides and simply rocking with wicked merriment, "it says:
  `The two metal monarchs are plotting the downfall of the present ruler of
  Oz.'FF20"
 "What else does it say?" inquired the Gnome King, who had more experience
  than his companion in dealing with the magicians of the Emerald City.
 "It says, `Ozma and her counselors have gone to the castle of Glinda the
  Good,' " Wutz told him, complacently closing and padlocking the big volume.
 "Then we'd better start at once and before they return," declared Ruggedo.
  "For as soon as we have my belt, we can change them to rocks wherever they
  are. The most important thing is to get that belt before they know we are
  after it. But how are we going to get to the Emerald City, and how're we
  going to open that safe?"
 "My silver blowpipe will reduce the safe to a heap of ashes without injuring

  the contents," answered the wizard, "and reaching the capital will be the
  simplest part of all!" Taking a silver tube from a high shelf, Wutz put it
  in his pocket and, reaching for his bubble pipe, he began to blow an
  enormous quicksilver bubble round himself and the Gnome King. Slowly and
  with both Kings inside, the bubble rose, passed in a silver mist out of the
  wizard's den, up through the honeycomb of caves, caverns, and grottos, on
 20up and up till it floated right out of the top of the Silver King's
  Mountain.
  
 CHAPTER 19
 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN!
 At the same moment the silver bubble carrying Wutz and Ruggedo burst out of
  the top of the mountain, Handy Mandy and Nox reached the bottom, arriving
  at last at the end of the winding stair. One amethyst burned dimly on the
  small landing, and crowded uncomfortably together the two prisoners found
  themselves facing a heavily barred door.
 Private Lower of the Wizard of Wutz.
 Keep Out!
 announced a surly sign. But Handy and Nox, their legs still quivering from
  the long downward climb, were in no humor to be stopped by a sign.
 "Lower!" sniffed Handy Mandy disgustedly. "I should think it was. We must be
  at the very bottom of this miserable mountain. Lower indeed! Well, I expect
  a lower is the opposite of a tower. Come on!" Picking up the silver ball,
  Handy squinted sharply at the door, giving it a quick shove to see whether
  it was locked or fitted with an invisible moving panel. But there was
  nothing remarkable about this door and nothing on it except a very small

  silver keyhole, which at once recalled to the Goat Girl the key she had
  been carrying around ever since she left Keretaria.
 "Oh, Nox, I believe the key in your horn will fit!" she cried excitedly, and
  deftly removing the left prong of Nox's headgear, she shook out the ball.
  Then, while Nox, fairly panting with impatience, looked on, Handy took the
  key from the ball and inserted it in the silver lock. When it turned easily
  and smoothly, she was almost afraid to open the door. What would they find
  on the other side? What had the wizard done to his helpless young captive?
  As Handy hesitated, Nox rushed forward, banging the door open with his
  great shoulder.
 "Kerry! Kerry!" wailed the faithful Ox, and falling to his knees, Nox began
  to snort and blubber in real earnest. Handy, hurrying after him into the
  small, stuffy cell, saw a handsome boy in hunting costume standing
  motionless and silent as a statue in the center of a great, shimmering,
  violet bubble. Without thinking or reasoning or even stopping to consult
  the Ox, the Goat Girl flung out all of her arms toward the solitary figure,
  her iron hand puncturing the bubble with a deafening pop.
 "Why, hello Nox!" The Little King stepped calmly out of the misty vapor, all
  that was left of the wizard's bubble. "Where's your other horn? And who is
  this jolly-looking girl?"
 WHO indeed? There was so much to be told and explained, even with Handy and
  Nox talking as fast as they could and taking turns, it took almost an hour
  to tell the story of their journey from Keretaria to the Silver Mountain
  and their awful experiences with the Wizard of Wutz. Kerry himself
  remembered nothing since he had started out on the hunting expedition. He

  listened with angry exclamations and bounces as Nox related the tale of
  King Kerr's treachery and the sad state of affairs in Keretaria. "And I've
  been shut up in this bubble for two years!" mourned the little King,
  looking round the dismal cell with a shudder. "Why, it makes my head ache
  just to think of it!"
 "Mine, too," agreed Handy, clapping Nox's left horn in place. "But it's
  almost over now, my lad. If we can just find some way out of this mountain,
  I'll settle old King Kerr and his High Boys, not to speak of this woozling
  wizard!"
 Placing Kerry on Nox's back, Handy looked nervously out the door of the
  Lower. At sight of the winding stair, Nox gave a great groan and shudder.
  "I'll never climb those steps again!" he declared, planting his feet
  stubbornly. "Never! Where's that silver hammer, m'lass? Give it a tap and
  see what the dwarf can do for us. Wutz and Ruggedo are too busy with their
  wicked plans to bother us now."
 "I wouldn't be too sure of that," muttered the Goat Girl. Nevertheless, she
  pulled out the hammer and tapped it lightly on the floor.
 "Well, what's wanted?" yawned Himself, appearing instantly and in the exact
  spot the hammer had struck.
 "We want to get out of here!" cried Kerry, so excited and delighted with the
  purple-bearded dwarf he instantly forgot all his troubles. With a crooked
  smile at the little King, Himself looked questioningly at Handy, and at the
  Goat Girl's quick nod rapped his knuckles on the north wall of the Lower.
  At once, a small panel slipped aside, revealing an elevator, its door
  invitingly open. Waving all her hands to thank Himself, who was already
  beginning to disappear, Handy stepped inside. Nox, with Kerry still perched

  on his back, just managed to squeeze in when the door snapped shut and the
  elevator sped upward carrying its three passengers in double-quicksilver
  time to the work den of the wizard. Handy, a bit disappointed not to find
  herself on top of the mountain, stepped out first. As Nox, with an awkward
  jump, followed her, the door slammed sharply and the elevator dropped like
  a plummet to the bottom of the mountain.
 "Oh, this must be where Wutz works all his magic transformations," breathed
  Kerry, sliding off Nox's back and gazing around with deep interest and
  curiosity. "I'll bet he blew a bubble round me right in this very den.
  Wonder where he is now?" There was a slight cough at Kerry's question, and
  turning, they saw Nifflepok standing uncertainly in the doorway.
 "Ah, so we meet again!" cried Handy, doubling up all her fists and walking
  grimly toward the Silver King's fat Minister. "Where is that rascally
  Master of yours? As you probably know by this time, we kept our part of the
  bargain, but he still has to keep his."
 "Indeed, you are fortunate to have escaped with your lives," muttered Wutz,
  taking off his hat and looking anxiously inside. "And I'm sorry to tell you
  the Wizard of Wutz NEVER keeps his bargains. No matter how hard we work or
  try to please him, sooner or later we are all shelved or potted!"
 "Then why work for such a villain?" snorted the Royal Ox gruffly. "Where is
  he now?"
 "Yes, where is he now?" asked Kerry, who in spite of the terrible stories he
  had heard, hoped to get a look at the wonderful wizard who had enchanted
  him.
 "Gone!" answered Nifflepok, putting on his high hat and giving it a couple

  of taps. "He's bubbled off with the Gnome King to conquer Oz, and I expect
  by this time they've bewitched about half the inhabitants of the Emerald
  City."
 "Oh, what a shame!" burst out Kerry.
 "Bubbled off? What do you mean by that?" The Goat Girl reached out all her
  arms to pull the Silver King's little Minister closer.
 "I mean bubbled off," repeated Nifflepok, struggling to release himself from
  Handy's clutches. "He blew a quicksilver bubble, and he and Ruggedo sailed
  away in it, if that's any plainer."
 "Oh, then we had better go right after them," snorted the Ox in an anxious
  voice. "Show us out of this mountain, you little pudding, or I'll toss you
  higher than a kite."
 "Oh, do let's do something!" begged Kerry, who, being young, was quite
  daring and absolutely foolhardy. "We aren't going to let those dreadful
  Kings conquer the country, are we, and not lift a hand?"
 "Well, I'm sure I'd lift all seven if it would do any good," mused Handy
  Mandy in a depressed voice. "But how can we stop them? Wutz and Rug have
  probably stolen all the magic in Ozma's palace by this time, the thieving
  rascals!"
 "But surely YOU have some magic," ventured Nifflepok, who had finally jerked
  himself free, "or you could never have disenchanted that gnome or found the
  wizard's Lower and rescued this boy; and if you haveFF20C4" he warned,
  backing rapidly away, "C4FF20if you have, you'd better use it QUICK. When
  Wutz finishes conquering Oz, he's sure to remember you and turn you to
  rocks and rubble. He's going to turn everyone to rocks and rubble!" wailed
  Nifflepok, dashing out of the workshop.

 "Great Gazoo, what shall we do? I don't want to be a rock," snorted Nox.
 "And I won't be a rock!" stormed the little King. "It was bad enough being
  shut up in a bubble and missing two whole years. Oh, you won't let him turn
  us to rocks, will you Handy? And do let's help poor Ozma before it's too
  late!"
 Kerry looked up at her so pleadingly that Handy, against all her
  inclinations and better judgment, pulled out the silver hammer again. "The
  hammer will be better than the ball," she reasoned quickly, "for the ball
  only seems to help Keretarians. Now then!" Lifting the hammer in her iron
  hand, the Goat Girl brought it down sharply on the wizard's marble table.
  Silver sparks flew up in every direction, and out of the very middle of the
  shower stepped the yawning dwarf.
 "Say, I'm trying to take a nap," grumbled Himself, stretching his arms up
  sleepily. "What do you fellows want now?"
 "We want to go to the Emerald City of Oz and save Ozma from Wutz and the
  Gnome King!" explained Handy in one breathless sentence.
 "My! All that?" Stifling another yawn, Himself grinned mischievously at the
  Goat Girl. "Then stand in line, please." So Handy placed herself in front
  of the Royal Ox and Kerry stepped behind him, and the dwarf, seizing the
  hammer, brought it down with a terrible blow just behind the little King.
  And what a blow it was you can readily understand when I tell you that its
  force carried the three travelers clear out of the Silver King's Mountain
  and all the way to the Emerald City itself. Flying along for a moment
  beside them, Himself slipped the hammer back in the Goat Girl's hand, and
  then with another tremendous yawn disappeared.

  
 CHAPTER 20
 JUST IN TIME!
 In Ozma's palace in the Emerald City, everything was very quiet and still.
  Not surprising when you consider that the Wizard of Wutz had blown his
  patent stupefying powder down all the chimneys before he and Ruggedo dared
  to enter. Then, mooring the silver bubble to one of the castle spires, the
  two conspirators had slipped through an open window and proceeded without
  delay or interference to the private sitting room of the absent ruler.
  There Ruggedo with a spiteful laugh thrust his head right into the mouths
  of the Hungry Tiger and Cowardly Lion. Rigid and helpless they sat before
  Ozma's safe, motionless and completely stupefied, as were all of Ozma's
  other faithful servants and retainers. Reducing the safe to a heap of green
  ashes was the work of but a moment, then, pulling the Gnome King's belt
  from the sparkling heap of treasures, Wutz sprang to his feet. "Quick! How
  does it work?" he cried, clasping the belt round his thin waist. "We'll not
  have a second's safety till Ozma, Glinda, the Wizard of Oz and all those
  girl Princesses are out of the way."
 "But first you must restore my Kingdom!" insisted Ruggedo, dancing up and
  down. "Here, give it to me. I'm used to it and can work faster. First I'll
  wish Kaliko off my throne and myself back in my underground castle,
  thenFF20C4"
 "Oh, no, you won't!" declared Wutz, holding the bouncing Gnome King off with
  one hand. "How do I know what you will do once you reach your own Kingdom?
  Why, I might never see this belt again."
 "But I promise to send it back to you," hissed Ruggedo, his eyes snapping

  real sparks.
 "I'd rather have the belt than the promise," said Wutz, shaking his head
  stubbornly.
 "Give it to me, I say, GIVE it to me!" yelled Ruggedo, now in a perfect
  rage. "How do I know what $$you&& will do when you know the trick of using
  it? Why, you might even turn me to a rock to be rid of me."
 "What? Change my dearest friend and most powerful ally to a rock?" exclaimed
  the Wizard with pretended horror. "By the left horn of my silver cow, I
  promise to return this belt as soon as I am Ruler of Oz!" Ruggedo longed to
  snatch his belt away from the scheming Silver Monarch, but as he was
  neither big or strong enough to do this, there was nothing for him to do
  but agree to the wizard's terms.
 "All right," he groaned dismally. "Listen, thenFF20C4" But as Wutz bent
  his head and the little gnome began to whisper hoarse directions in his
  ear, there was a dreadful thump and clatter behind them.
 "STOP!" commanded the Goat Girl, the first to recover from the shock of the
  landing, and dear knows Handy should have been used to sudden landings by
  this time. "STOP!" Whirling round with a howl of fury, Wutz sprang straight
  at her, but Handy, who still clutched the silver hammer in her iron hand,
  was too quick for him and brought it down with a resounding crack on the
  top of his head. "Take 'em away! Take 'em away!" cried Handy hysterically
  as Wutz fell over backwards and Himself, appearing exactly where the hammer
  had struck, leaped off the wizard's head to save himself from a fall.
 "But first we must have that magic belt," chuckled the hammer elf. Giving
  Ruggedo, who was struggling frantically to get his belt from around the

  Silver King's waist, a push, Himself unbuckled the clasps and tossed the
  magic girdle to the Goat Girl. Then, grabbing the howling gnome and
  senseless wizard each by the neck, the efficient dwarf vanished in a flash
  of lightning and a crash of thunder that shook the castle to its
  foundations. Nox dropped to his knees. Kerry, still stunned by the hammer
  blow that had carried them to the Emerald City, and Handy herself with her
  arms still upraised, stared in dumb astonishment at the quivering vacuum
  where the two Kings and Himself, the elf, had been whirling a moment
  before.
 "Oh, Handy, HANDY, you've really done it!" shouted Kerry, finding his voice
  at last. "Why, you've saved the whole of Ozma's Kingdom and struck only one
  blow! But watch out, are those beasts alive or just statues?"
 "Statues, I hope," grunted the Royal Ox, lurching dizzily to his feet.
  "Well, here we are in the capital, m'lass, and I must say you have handled
  everything beautifully, beautifully!"
 "Halt! Who goes there? Whoa! HO! Halt and Surrender!" piped a frightened
  voice. "Here they are, your Majesty, the robbers themselves, caught
  red-handed in the act of robbing our royal safe!"
 "Red-, white- and blue-handed, if you ask me!" cried the Patchwork Girl,
  blinking her shoe-button eyes at the red rubber hand with which Handy
  grasped the Gnome King's belt, the white hand she had reached out to hold
  on to Kerry, the iron hand still clutching the silver hammer. All the rest
  of her hands the Goat Girl held stiffly before her. Brushing aside the
  Soldier with the Green Whiskers, who promptly dived behind a sofa, Scraps
  jerked the Gnome King's belt out of Handy's rubber hand and gave her a
  shove that sent her flying over backwards. "Take that, you Monster!" yelled

  Scraps.
 "Well," sputtered the Goat Girl, sprawling flat on her back, "here's
  gratitude for you!"
 "How dare you call Handy a Monster?" bellowed Nox, charging angrily after
  the Patchwork Girl.
 "Oh! Do be careful!" called Ozma with a little scream as Nox almost caught
  up with Scraps and Kerry began to belabor the Soldier with Green Whiskers
  over the head with a candlestick. "Oh! Oh! My poor Lion! My poor Tiger! My
  SAFE! Why, I just can't believe it!" wailed the little Fairy Ruler, staring
  sorrowfully down at the Goat Girl, who had made no attempt to rise or
  explain her embarrassing position.
 "Then don't believe it!" cried Kerry breathlessly, "For it isn't true! This
  brave girl and Nox have got the best of Wutz and the Gnome King and saved
  your whole bally Kingdom, and here you've gone and had her knocked down.
  Shame on you! Get away from me, you cotton-stuffed horror!" screamed the
  little King as Scraps, eluding the Ox, made a determined jump in his
  direction.
 "Quiet! QUIET!" The Scarecrow, who with Glinda, the Wizard, Dorothy, Betsy
  and Trot now came hurrying into the room, raised both arms and looked
  around pleadingly. The whole royal party, traveling in Glinda's swan
  chariot, had just arrived on the balcony outside, but Ozma, Scraps and the
  Soldier with Green Whiskers had been first on the scene of action.
 "The boy is right," declared Glinda, crossing slowly to a green sofa. "I can
  see by her face and handsFF20C4" Glinda smiled faintly, "C4FF20that
  this girl is both honest and industrious."

 "Thanks!" murmured Handy as the Scarecrow, ever a gentleman, bounded forward
  to assist her to her feet. The flimsy straw fellow lost his balance in the
  attempt, but his little act of gallantry did much to relieve an awkward
  moment.
 "You see," puffed the Scarecrow, seating Handy with a flourish, "for the
  last ten days we've all been pretty much upset around here, and you'll have
  to excuse Scraps for jumping at conclusions."
 "Please do!" Ozma spoke pleasantly and seriously as she seated herself in
  her small armchair, leaning over to take the Gnome King's belt from Scraps.
  "But if some of you kind people will just explain..." The Little Fairy
  looked anxiously from the stupefied Tiger and Lion to her pulverized safe,
  her eyes coming back to rest on the Goat Girl, the great White Ox, and the
  handsome young Munchkin.
  
 CHAPTER 21
 THE HAMMER ELF EXPLAINS
 "Go ahead and explain," said Handy, closing her eyes and leaning back in her
  chair with all her hands hanging limply at her side. So Nox, a bit
  haughtily and tossing his head proudly from time to time, began at the
  beginning and told all that had happened since Handy Mandy had flown from
  Mt. Mern: how the Goat Girl had found the magic in his horn, how they had
  traveled together from Keretaria to the Silver Mountain and there, in their
  search for the little King, discovered Wutz's plot to make himself Supreme
  Wizard of Oz. And last of all, he explained how Handy, with the help of the
  silver hammer, had subdued the two wicked Kings.
 "Well, it certainly was very kind of you to take all this trouble for us

  after you had already had so many worries of your own," sighed Ozma as Nox,
  finishing his story, gazed round the room with lordly condescension.
 "Yes, wasn't it?" Handy opened her eyes and thoughtfully regarded the little
  Ruler of Oz. "Still, I'm glad now that we did save you." The Goat Girl's
  round pleasant face was suddenly wreathed in smiles. "I didn't think I was
  going to like you, but I do," she admitted cheerfully. "I believe you're
  about the best ruler Oz could have, and besides, you're pretty as a goat."
 "As a goat!" gasped the Wizard of Oz while Dorothy and all the other girls
  had all they could do to keep from laughing right out loud. But Ozma, who
  was a very understanding little person, smiled kindly back at Handy Mandy.
 "Goats $$are&& pretty," she agreed, nodding her head politely. "And since
  you miss your own goats very much, perhaps you would like me to send you
  back to Mt. Mern after you've seen a bit of the capital."
 "Oh, Handy wouldn't leave us!" snorted the royal Ox, moving as close to the
  Goat Girl as he could get. "We couldn't get along without Handy Mandy, your
  Majesty."
 "Oh, please let her stay in Keretaria," begged the little King, adding his
  voice to that of his Royal Ox. "You will live with us in the palace, won't
  you, Handy?"
 "Well, if I just had my goatsFF20C4" considered the seven-armed maiden.
  "Mt. Mern would seem rather dull after Oz," she acknowledged pensively.
  "But what about that old King who's still on Kerry's throne, and what am I
  to do with this silver hammer, and what do you suppose Himself has done
  with Wutz and Ruggedo?"
 "Yes, what's to be done with Wutz?" echoed the Scarecrow, wrinkling up his

  cotton forehead. And now the little sitting room began fairly to buzz with
  excited questions and suggestions, for there was still a lot to be
  explained and settled. The Ozites could hardly keep their eyes off the
  seven-armed Goat Girl, the handsome young ruler of Keretaria, and his Royal
  Ox. Dorothy longed to unscrew his horn and test its magic power for
  herself, but Ozma, anxious to repair all the damage done by the wicked
  wizard, now raised her scepter for silence.
 Clasping on the Gnome King's belt, Ozma first brought back her magic picture
  and with a quick wish returned Glinda's book of records to her castle in
  the South. Next, though she knew neither the extent nor the nature of the
  wizard's other thefts, she caused to be restored to their rightful owners
  all the magic appliances in the Silver King's den. The Scarecrow had
  already reported the stupefied condition of the other occupants of the
  palace, so Ozma's next thought was to restore them to their accustomed
  selves. No sooner was the Cowardly Lion released than he crawled under a
  table, but the Hungry Tiger rushed out on the balcony, growling and lashing
  his tail as he thought of the indignity he had suffered.
 After a short conference with Handy Mandy, Ozma freed all the potted
  prisoners of the wicked wizard and made Nifflepok King of the Silver
  Mountain. She moved the cliff dwellings of the people to the outside of the
  mountain so Wutz's pale subjects could enjoy with the rest of the Gillikins
  the bright sunshine and beneficent climate of Oz. The Magic Mountain
  itself, with all its dark pits and jeweled caverns, Ozma sealed up tightly
  and forever. The wizard's agents were turned to moles, for they were
  already more like these boring little animals than men.
 After each magic wish or transformation, the little group in the royal

  sitting room would look in the magic picture, which Ozma had immediately
  repaired. And in each case Handy felt that the ruler of Oz had used both
  wisdom and good judgment. Nox, as they were watching the wizard's agents
  turn to moles, gave a snort of surprise, for the first figure shown was old
  King Kerr, who was really Number Nine. As the wicked imposter changed
  quickly from a man to a mole and scurried off the throne and away to bury
  himself in the blue forest, Nox and Handy both heaved a sigh of relief and
  satisfaction.
 While Ozma was working on the magic safe, Handy, deciding to try a little of
  her own magic, softly tapped the silver hammer on the arm of her chair. At
  once, to the delight and interest of everyone, Himself, the elf, appeared
  astride the arm, holding a small cactus plant in each hand. "I wish you in
  the future to obey the summons of her Majesty Ozma of Oz," smiled the Goat
  Girl, placing the silver hammer as she spoke in Ozma's lap. "This young
  fairy is more experienced in magic than I and will know to use the hammer
  to best advantage."
 "Oh, all right! But I rather liked working for you," grinned Himself. "And
  say, I tried to turn these rascals to plants, but this was the best I could
  do." Setting the two pots of cactus down on a small writing desk, the
  hammer elf bowed first to Handy and then to Ozma. "Wait! Don't go!" begged
  the little Fairy as Himself showed unmistakable signs of disappearing. "Do
  tell us about this silver hammer and who owned it first."
 "It belonged to Wunchie, a witch of the West who's lived in the Munchkin
  Mountains for about a thousand years and used it to control as many of the
  Munchkin Kings as she could," explained the dwarf, balancing himself

  cleverly on an inkwell.
 "Then I suppose Wunchie was responsible for the prophecy in Keretaria,"
  surmised Nox, blinking his eyes at the hammer elf. The dwarf nodded
  cheerfully.
 "Yes, Wunchie invented that prophecy," he told them, "and placed her own
  white oxen in the country. Each time she had trouble forcing the King to do
  as she wished, she tapped him and the ox on the head with her hammer. But I
  took rather a fancy to you," admitted Himself, looking fondly at Nox. "So
  when she ordered me to tap you off and traded the little King Kerry to Wutz
  for a basket of jumping beans and put Wutz's agent on the throne of
  Keretaria, I decided to take a hand myself. So I gave you only a light tap
  and at the same time I stored enough magic in your horns to help you find
  Kerry C4 and with the help of this handy Goat Girl, you DID find him!"
  beamed the hammer elf. "I knew my magic was good. You can't work for a
  witch without learning good magic. But now, since everything is turning out
  so splendidly, I'll just go back to my tree stump. One, two, three, back to
  my tree!"
 "But what became of the witch?" cried Ozma, catching hold of the dwarf's
  purple beard (for his head had already vanished).
 "Ha, ha! She exploded and popped off!" roared a voice from the place where
  the elf's head had been. "I told her not to eat those jumping beans! And
  after that, I buried her hammer in the garden of Keretaria, and there it
  stayed till Handy plowed it up. Goodbye, all!" And the body of the hammer
  elf melted into nothing and was gone.
 "MyC4y, what a clever fellow!" chuckled Handy. "So now Wutz and Ruggedo are
  a couple of cactuses! MmC4mmm! MmmmC4mm! Unpleasant to the last! Do you

  suppose anyone can ever disenchant them? For goatness sake, be careful!"
  begged Handy as Jellia, in answer to her Mistress' ring, came to carry the
  plants to the conservatory. "Whatever you do, don't drop 'em. And to think
  that the Wizard is potted himself! Well, I'll never have a hand in breaking
  $$his&& enchantment!"
 "I never thought anyone could ever break Ruggedo's enchantment," confessed
  Ozma. "When I changed him to a jug, I commanded him to keep that shape till
  he was broken by the seventh hand of a traveling Mernite. And at that time
  I did not even know there was such a place as Mt. Mern or a clever Goat
  Girl like Handy."
 "But aren't you glad there was?" shouted the little Wizard of Oz, tossing up
  his hat and catching it on his nose. "Aren't we all glad to know Handy
  Mandy, Nox and this jolly young King?"
 "Long live the Royal Ox and the Little King of Keretaria!" cried the
  cheering Ozites. "Long live Handy Mandy, the seven-armed wonder of the
  world and OZ!"\
 And, of course, they will live long; everyone lives long in Oz. But even if
  Handy lives to be a hundred, she will never forget the grand banquet given
  that evening in her honor. Besides the famous people she already knew, the
  Goat Girl was presented to all the other celebrities at Ozma's court, and
  shaking hands with them heartily and seven at a time she had never been so
  flattered and fussed over in her life. Nox and Kerry came in for their
  share of honors, too. There was nothing the Ozians would not have done for
  their three new friends and rescuers.
 Ozma, overwhelmed by Handy's generosity in giving her the silver hammer and

  already indebted to her for saving the Kingdom, racked her brains for some
  wonderful gift to reward the brave mountain lass. But it was Nox who solved
  the difficulty by confiding to Ozma that Handy desired more than anything
  else a set of gloves for her hands. It seemed she had never had enough
  gloves for more than two at a time. So, smiling secretly to herself, Ozma
  gave the Goat Girl seven sets of fine kid gloves and an emerald necklace
  that wound three times round her sturdy neck. With the necklace, a complete
  new outfit, and her forty-nine gloves, Handy Mandy felt herself quite ready
  for high life and royal society.
 "Though you really should wear a boxing glove on that iron hand," whispered
  the Scarecrow as Handy blushingly resumed her seat after Ozma's speech of
  presentation. "Stay in the Emerald City, and we will make you a general in
  the army," promised the straw man earnestly. But Handy shook her head with
  tears of merriment in her eyes. Though she never quite forgave Scraps for
  pushing her over, she and the Scarecrow were already as friendly and easy
  as an old pair of shoes. "Handy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
  Friday, Saturday and Sunday," the straw man had nicknamed her because she
  had a hand for every day in the week.
 Nox had insisted on Himself being invited to the banquet, and the clever elf
  added much to the pleasure and hilarity of that memorable occasion. Indeed,
  many times afterward when she felt bored or lonely, Ozma would summon
  Himself just to amuse and cheer her up. The silver hammer was stored away
  with the other important magic treasures and is regarded by many as the
  most powerful magic in the castle. Handy Mandy kept the blue flower to help
  her on future journeys, and after she and her two friends had spent a happy
  week in the Emerald City, Ozma reluctantly wished Kerry and Nox to

  Keretaria and the Goat Girl back to Mt. Mern.
 There for a month Handy Mandy astonished the villagers with the story of her
  travels, then, gathering up her goats, she took herself and them by a fast
  wishing pill the Wizard had given her to the Kingdom of Keretaria. As the
  Goat Girl's hands retained all of their strength and willingness and Nox's
  horns all their magic C4 even to giving wise and useful messages C4 these
  two and little Kerry ruled the Kingdom between them with such skill and
  cleverness that everyone was enormously happy and prosperous!
