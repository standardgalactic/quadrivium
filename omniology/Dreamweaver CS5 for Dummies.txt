Author’s Acknowledgments
I love teaching Web design because it’s so much fun to see what everyone 
creates on the Internet. Most of all, I want to thank all the people who have 
read my books or watched my videos over the years and gone on to create 
Web sites. You are my greatest inspiration, and I sincerely enjoy it when you 
send me links to your Web sites. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thanks to the love my life, David LaFontaine, whose patience and support 
keep me fed, loved, and (mostly) sane, even when I’m up against impossible 
deadlines. You are a constant source of inspiration, and I love you more than 
you will ever know.
For their contributions to this book, special thanks to photographer Jasper 
Johal (www.jasperphoto.com); to designer Lynn Garrett; and my father, 
Robin Warner, for his fabulous tree farm.
Thanks to the entire editorial team: Jeff Noble for his superb technical editing 
and great ideas; Becky Huehls for catching the details, improving the prose, 
and being a great friend and ally; and Bob Woerner for shepherding this 
book through the development and publishing process (again and again and 
again).
Over the years, I’ve thanked many people in my books — family, friends, 
teachers, and mentors — but I have been graced by so many wonderful 
people now that no publisher will give me enough pages to thank them all. So 
let me conclude by thanking everyone who has ever helped me with a Web 
site, a book, or any other aspect of writing and research, just so I can go to 
sleep tonight and know I haven’t forgotten anyone.

Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies

Introduction
I
n the 15-plus years that I’ve been writing about Web design, I’ve seen 
many changes — from the early days (before Dreamweaver even existed) 
when you could create only simple pages with HTML 1.0, to the elaborate 
designs you can create with Dreamweaver today using XHTML, CSS, AJAX, 
multimedia, and more.
If you’re not sure what those acronyms mean yet, don’t worry. I remember 
what it was like to figure out all this stuff, too, so I designed this book to 
introduce you to the basic concepts before you get into the more advanced 
features. To prepare you for the ever-changing world of Web design, I show 
you how to use Dreamweaver to create Web sites that take advantage of the 
latest advances in Web technology — such as CSS, AJAX, and Dreamweaver’s 
newest feature, Business Catalyst.
One of the challenges of Web design today is that Web pages are not only 
being displayed on different kinds of computers, but are also being down-
loaded to computers with monitors as big as widescreen televisions — or as 
small as the little screens on cell phones. As a result, creating Web sites that 
look good to all visitors is a lot more complex than it used to be — and stan-
dards have become a lot more important. That’s why this book shows you 
not only how to use all the great features in Dreamweaver but also how to 
determine which of those features best serve your goals and your audience.

Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies 
What’s New in Dreamweaver CS5?
Dreamweaver’s high-end features make it the preferred choice for profes-
sional Web designers, and its easy-to-use graphical interface makes it popular 
among novices and hobbyists as well. With each new version, Dreamweaver’s 
become more powerful and feature-rich — but this upgrade is arguably the 
most dramatic, with the following new features:
 
✓ Streamlined site setup features: Before you work on a new (or existing) 
Web site in Dreamweaver, it’s important to complete the site setup pro-
cess (covered in Chapter 2). Although setting up a site so Dreamweaver 
can identify how to set links and images is a basic function — and much 
the same as it was before — Adobe streamlined the process: Now it’s 
faster and easier to set up a new site, and the more advanced setup 
options are moved to separate categories. You’ll still find all the features 
that were there before, but you don’t have to review them all in detail to 
set up a site.
 
✓ BrowserLab: One of the biggest challenges of Web design is making sure 
your pages look good in the wide variety of Web browsers in use on 
the Internet. BrowserLab helps by testing your pages in many different 
browsers — taking a screenshot of each, and then returning the results 
so you can quickly assess how your pages look in each one. Adobe has 
been experimenting with BrowserLab for a while, and in Dreamweaver 
CS5, they’ve built the online feature into the program by adding an 
option for BrowserLab to the Preview menu. (Note: You must be online 
for this feature to work. Okay, you probably knew that; if not, your 
secret’s safe with me.)
 
✓ Business Catalyst: The most dramatic addition to Dreamweaver is called 
Business Catalyst. Adobe acquired this suite of tools and integrated 
them into version CS5 to work in conjunction with InContext Editing. 
The result is a powerful collection of features that make it easier than 
ever to add a shopping cart to your site, design and send e-mail newslet-
ters, manage a contact database, and let other people (contributors or 
clients) update their own Web sites.
 
✓ CSS Enable/Disable: To make it easier to identify conflicts in style sheet 
rules, Dreamweaver now features the ability to easily turn any style rule 
on or off.
 
✓ CSS Inspect: Following the lead of the popular Firefox toolbar Firebug, 
CSS Inspect helps you identify and troubleshoot CSS, without having to 
publish your pages and set up a Firefox extension. This tool is designed 
to be used with LiveView, which makes it possible to view a Web page as 
it will look on a server (from a location on your hard drive). To use this 
feature, click LiveView, and then click the CSS Inspect button, or choose 
View➪Inspect.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ CSXS (Creative Suites Extended Services): This collection of three new 
features is designed to make collaboration easier. Share My Screen (also 
included in version CS4) works with Adobe Connect to make it easy 
to share whatever is on your computer screen with up to three other 
people over the Internet. Search for Help is the second option in this 
feature set — a new tool that integrates the best of Adobe’s online help 
directly into Dreamweaver (again, you must have an Internet connec-
tion to use this feature). Finally, this tool makes it easier to integrate 
Dreamweaver with third-party Flash-based services.
 
✓ Vertical Split View: When you choose Split View, Dreamweaver now 
automatically splits the screen vertically instead of horizontally. That’s 
great if you have a giant monitor — but if you’re working on a laptop or 
other small screen, you can change the split to horizontal by deselecting 
the vertical settings (choose View➪Split Vertically to uncheck it the ver-
tical option).
 
✓ Dynamically related files: Building on the features added to 
Dreamweaver CS4, in CS5, you can now view more dynamically related 
files simultaneously and you can view files included in other files. This is 
especially helpful if you’re trying to view templates or pages created in a 
program such as WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla!.
 
✓ Optimized linguistic library: Dreamweaver CS5 is better suited to the 
increasingly international audience on the Web by including dictionar-
ies and other linguistic support for 37 different languages (CS4 sup-
ported only 15 languages). Languages supported in CS5 include Arabic, 
Bokmal [Norway], Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, 
English [Canada], English [GB], English [US], Estonian, Finnish, French 
[Canada], French [France], German [Germany], German [Switzerland], 
Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Nynorsk 
[Norway], Polish, Portuguese [Brazil], Portuguese [Portugal], Romanian, 
Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.
 
✓ PHP code hinting: Adds many new PHP code hints, as well as the capa-
bility to add your own hints.
 
✓ Site-specific code hints: For anyone working on multiple Web sites, this 
feature makes it easier to create snippets specific to each of your Web 
sites, keeping them separate to avoid cluttering the interface.
 
✓ Workspace enhancements: You’ll also find a few other changes to the 
interface, including: a new Lock button in the top-left corner that makes 
it easy to make any page read-only. If you’re working on Windows, you’ll 
no longer see the full path of each page in the title bar. This makes it 
easier to see the final part of the URL, which is all that really matters 
after you’ve finished setting up the site.

Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies 
Using Dreamweaver on a Mac or PC
Dreamweaver works almost identically on Macintosh or Windows computers. 
To keep screenshots consistent throughout this book, I’ve used a computer 
running Windows 7. However, I’ve tested the program on both platforms, and 
whenever there is a difference in how a feature works, I indicate that differ-
ence in the instructions.
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, 
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions 
is in italics? I frequently put new terms in italics and then define them so you 
know what they mean. It just makes reading so much nicer.
When I type URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses within regular para-
graph text, they look like this: www.digitalfamily.com. Sometimes, how-
ever, I set a particular URL on its own line, like this:
www.digitalfamily.com
That’s so you can easily spot the URLs on a page if you want to type them 
into your browser to visit a site. I also assume that your Web browser 
doesn’t require the introductory http:// for Web addresses. If you use an 
older browser, remember to type that quaint prefix before the address (also 
make sure you include that part of the address when you’re creating links in 
Dreamweaver).
Even though Dreamweaver makes knowing HTML code unnecessary, you 
may want to wade into HTML waters occasionally. I include HTML code in 
this book when I think it can help you better understand how things work in 
design view. Sometimes it’s easier to remove or edit a tag in code view than 
design view. When I do provide examples — such as the following code that 
links a URL to a Web page — I set off the HTML in the same monospaced type 
as URLs:
<a href=”http://www.digitalfamily.com”>Janine’s Digital 
Family Web Site</a>
When I introduce you to a new set of features, such as options in a dialog 
box, I set those items apart with bullet lists so you can see that they’re all 
related. When I want you to follow instructions, I use numbered step lists to 
walk you through the process.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re like most of the Web designers I know, you don’t have time to wade 
through a thick book before you start working on your Web site. That’s why I 
wrote Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies in a way that makes it easy for you to find 
the answers you need quickly. You don’t have to read this book cover to cover. 
If you’re in a hurry, go right to the information you need most and then get back 
to work. If you’re new to Web design or you want to know the intricacies of 
Dreamweaver, skim through the chapters to get an overview — and then go back 
and read what’s most relevant to your project in greater detail. Whether you’re 
building a simple site for the first time or working to redesign a complex site for 
the umpteenth time, you find everything you need in these pages.
Foolish Assumptions
Although Dreamweaver is designed for professional developers, I don’t 
assume you’re a pro — at least not yet. In keeping with the philosophy 
behind the For Dummies series, this book is an easy-to-use guide designed for 
readers with a wide range of experience. If you’re interested in Web design 
and want to create a Web site, that’s all I expect from you.
If you’re an experienced Web designer, Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies is an 
ideal reference for you because it gets you working quickly with this program — 
starting with basic Web-page design features and progressing to more advanced 
options. If you’re new to Web design, this book walks you through all you need 
to know to create a Web site, from creating a new page to publishing your fin-
ished project on the Web.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the learning curve associated with any new program, I 
organized Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies as a complete reference. This sec-
tion provides a breakdown of the five parts of the book and what you can find 
in each one. Each chapter walks you through the features of Dreamweaver 
step by step, providing tips and helping you understand the vocabulary of 
Web design as you go along.
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites
Part I introduces you to the basic concepts of Web design as well as the 
main features of Dreamweaver. In Chapter 1, I give you an overview of the 

6
Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies 
many approaches to Web design, so you can best determine how you want 
to build your Web site before you get into the details of which features in 
Dreamweaver are best suited to any particular design approach. In Chapter 2, 
I start you on the road to your first Web site — including creating a new site, 
importing an existing site, creating new Web pages, applying basic format-
ting, and setting links. To make this chapter more interesting and help you 
see how all these features come together, I walk you through creating a real 
Web page as I show you how the features work.
In Chapter 3, I move onto graphics, with an introduction to creating graph-
ics for the Web, an overview of the differences in formats (GIFs, JPEGs, and 
PNG files), and detailed instructions for adding and positioning graphics in 
your pages. In Chapter 4, you discover Dreamweaver’s testing and publishing 
features, so you can make sure that all your links work and your Web site will 
look good in all the most important Web browsers. After you’re sure you’re 
sit is ready to go online, you find everything you need to start uploading 
pages to the Internet.
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options
Chapter 5 provides an overview of how Cascading Style Sheets work and 
how they can save you time. CSS has become the way to create page designs 
and manage formatting on Web pages, and these features have been nicely 
improved in Dreamweaver CS5. In this chapter, you find descriptions of 
the style definition options available in Dreamweaver as well as instruc-
tions for creating and applying styles. In Chapter 6, I take you further into 
CSS, introducing you to the power of <div> tags, how to create CSS lay-
outs, how to create centered CSS designs and fluid layouts, and how to use 
Dreamweaver’s newest CSS testing features. .
In Chapter 7, I introduce you to some of my favorite Dreamweaver features, 
including sophisticated template capabilities that enable you to create more 
consistent designs and make global updates across many pages at once. I 
also cover Dreamweaver’s Library items, which can be used to place and 
update commonly used elements, such as navigation bars or copyright tags. 
In Chapter 8, you discover how to use HTML table features (and when they’re 
still recommended on the Web).
Part III: Making It Cool with 
Advanced Features
In Part III, you discover how cool your site can look when you add interactive 
image features, audio, video, and Flash. In Chapter 9, you find instructions for 
creating an interactive photo gallery with the Swap Image behavior, as well 
as how to use other features in Dreamweaver’s Behaviors panel — including 

7
 Introduction
the Open New Browser behavior. In Chapter 10, you find out what it takes to 
add multimedia to your Web pages, including how to insert and create links 
to a variety of file types — from Flash to video and audio files. In Chapter 
11, I cover Dreamweaver’s HTML form options, which you can use to add 
feedback forms, surveys, and much more. In Chapter 12, you discover how 
great the Spry features are for adding AJAX interactivity to your site. In this 
chapter, you find instructions for creating and customizing drop-down lists, 
collapsible panels, and more.
In Part III, Chapter 13, you also learn the basics of how database-driven 
Web sites work and find an introduction to Dreamweaver’s dynamic site-
development features. In Chapter 14, you discover Dreamweaver’s InContext 
Editing features, which make it easy to enable other people (your friends, 
colleagues, cousin Tina) to update a site built in Dreamweaver using nothing 
more than a Web browser. You also find an introduction to the most dra-
matic new addition to version CS5, Business Catalyst. This online service is 
designed to work with InContext Editing and adds a suite of online tools you 
can use with Dreamweaver, including a shopping cart, traffic tracking and 
reporting programs, and options for creating and managing bulk e-mail 
messages for newsletters and other correspondence.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Part IV features three quick references to help you develop the best Web 
sites possible. Chapter 15 provides a collection of online resources where 
you can register domain names and find hosting services, as well as a few 
services that can help you take care of more advanced challenges (such as 
setting up an e-commerce system). In Chapter 16, you find ten design tips to 
help you get the most out of Dreamweaver.

n the early days of the Web, designing pages was relatively easy — and 
vanilla boring. You could combine images and text, but that was about it. 
No complex layouts, no fancy fonts, and certainly no multimedia or animation.
Over the years, Web design has evolved into an increasingly complex field, 
and Dreamweaver has evolved with it, adding new features that go way 
beyond the basics of combining a few words and images.
When I first started learning to create Web sites in the mid-1990s, it was easy 
to learn — and easy to teach others how to do it. More than a dozen years 
and a dozen books later, it’s a lot more complex. I’ve come to realize that one 
of the first things you have to understand about Web design is that there isn’t 
just one way to create a Web site anymore.
Today, you can learn how to design simple Web sites in a matter of hours — 
or you can spend years developing the advanced programming skills it takes 
to create complex Web sites like the ones you see at Amazon.com or MSNBC.
For everything in between, Dreamweaver is the clear choice among profes-
sional Web designers, as well as among a growing number of people who 
want to build sites for their hobbies, clubs, families, and small businesses.

12
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
In this chapter, you discover the many ways you can create a Web site and 
the tools Dreamweaver offers to make those designs possible. The more you 
understand about the various approaches to Web design, the better you can 
appreciate your options. You also find a quick tour of the Dreamweaver CS5 
interface so you understand the basics of moving around the workspace as 
you begin to design your site.
Understanding How Web Design Works
In a nutshell, building a Web site involves creating individual pages and link-
ing them to other pages. You need to have a home page, the first page visi-
tors see when they arrive at your Web address, (also known as your URL), 
and that page needs to bring them into the rest of the pages of the site, usu-
ally with links to each of the main sections of the site. Those pages, in turn, 
link to subsections that can then lead to deeper subsections.
After you create a Web site, you can test all the links on your own hard 
drive and then upload the pages to a Web server when everything is ready 
and working well. You can read more about setting up a site and using 
Dreamweaver to create pages on your local computer in Chapter 2. In 
Chapter 4, you discover how to upload your pages to a Web server when 
you’re ready to publish your site on the Internet.
The most important thing to remember is that you need to create a folder on 
your local computer that will mirror your Web site on your Web server when 
you publish your site. That’s why the site-setup process in Chapter 2 is so 
important — because it sets up Dreamweaver to help you create these two 
versions of your site: the version you create and edit on your computer and 
the perfect copy you need to maintain on the Web server. 
Although you have to save all the files in your site in one main folder, you 
can create subfolders to organize the site. Thus a big part of planning a Web 
site is determining how to divide the pages of your site into sections and 
how those sections should link to one another. Dreamweaver makes creating 
pages and setting links easy, but how you organize the pages is up to you.
 
If you’re new to this, you may think you don’t need to worry much about how 
your Web site will grow and develop. Think again. All good Web sites grow, 
and the bigger they get, the harder they are to manage. Planning the path of 
growth for your Web site before you begin can make a tremendous difference 
later. Neglecting to think about growth is probably one of the most common 
mistakes among new designers. This becomes even more serious when more 
than one person is working on the same site. Without a clearly established site 
organization and some common conventions for tasks such as naming files, 
confusion reigns.

13
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
Managing your site’s structure
Managing the structure of a Web site has two sides: the side that users see, 
which depends on how you set up links, and the side that’s behind-the-
scenes, which depends on how you organize files and folders.
What the user sees
The side that the user sees is all about navigation. When users arrive at your 
home page, where do you direct them? How do they move from one page 
to another in your site? A good Web site is designed so that users navigate 
easily and intuitively and can make a beeline to the information most relevant 
to them. As you plan, make sure that users can
 
✓ Access key information easily from more than one place in the site
 
✓ Move back and forth easily between pages and sections
 
✓ Return to main pages and subsections in one step
Setting links is easy in Dreamweaver; the challenge is to make sure that 
those links are easy for visitors to follow. One of the best ways to ensure that 
visitors can easily move around your site is to create a navigation or menu 
bar to include links to the main pages of your site on every page of your 
site. You find instructions in Chapter 6 for creating a menu bar with CSS. In 
Chapter 12, you find out how to use Dreamweaver’s Spry features to create a 
drop-down list using AJAX. And in Chapter 7, you find instructions for using 
Dreamweaver’s template and library features, which make menus easier to 
include on your pages — as well as faster and easier to update.
What’s behind the scenes
The second side to managing your Web site structure happens behind the 
scenes (where your users can’t see the information, but you want some kind 
of organizational system to remember what’s what). You’ll have files for all the 
images, HTML pages, animations, sound files, and anything else you put in your 
Web site. Before you begin building your site with Dreamweaver, think about 
how to keep track of all these files. At minimum, consider the following:
 
✓ A file-naming system: For example, naming image files consistently can 
make them easier to find if you need to edit them later. Similarly, giving 
the main section pages in your site names that match the text of the 
links on your pages can make setting the links easier. For example, if you 
add a Contact link on your site’s home page, you can easily figure out 
what page that link should point to if your contact page is named 
contact.html.

14
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
✓ A folder structure: When your Web site grows past a handful of pages, 
organizing them in separate folders or directories can help you keep 
track. Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes this easy by providing a Files 
panel where you can see all the files of your site — and even move and 
rename files and folders.
HTM-what? Exploring HTML and XHTML
Contrary to popular belief, HTML isn’t a programming language. Rather, it’s a 
markup language: That is, HTML is designed to mark up a page, or to provide 
instructions for how a Web page should look. HTML is written by using tags, 
which are markup instructions that tell a Web browser how to display the 
page. For example, to apply italic formatting to text, you (or Dreamweaver) 
insert the HTML tag <em>, which stands for emphasis, where you want the 
italics to begin and end. Most tags in HTML include both an opening tag and 
a close tag, indicated by the forward slash /. Thus, to make the name of this 
book appear in italics, I would write the code like this:
<em>Dreamweaver CS5 For Dummies.</em>
 
Another challenge of HTML and XHTML is that the tags have changed over 
time. In the early days, bold was created using the <b> tag and if you wanted 
italics, you used the <i> tag. Although that may seem more logical than using 
<em> for italic and <strong> to make text bold, these latter tags are now 
preferred because they give the user greater control over the display of text 
in the browser. That’s because the formatting for the <em> and <strong> 
tags can be altered to use other formatting options for text that you want to 
emphasize or strengthen on the page.
XHTML, a stricter version of HTML, is the recommended language to use 
to meet the highest standards of Web design today. Among the differences 
between the two languages, XHTML must be written in lowercase letters; 
in HTML, it doesn’t matter whether tags are upper- or lowercase. Similarly, 
XHTML requires that all tags include a close tag (more on that later in this 
chapter). Rest assured all templates and code examples in this book follow 
the XHTML standard.
You have two ways to see what the code behind a Web page looks like:
 
✓ In most browsers, choose View➪Source. 
 
✓ If you’re using Dreamweaver (as shown in Figure 1-1), you can click the 
Split button (upper-left corner of the workspace) to see the code and the 
design areas of the program at the same time in Split view.

15
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
 
Split view in Dreamweaver is a useful way to keep an eye on what’s going on 
behind the scenes — and, as a bonus, you can learn a lot of XHTML as you go 
along.
Dreamweaver offers three view options:
 
✓ Code: In Code view, you see only the XHTML and other code.
 
✓ Split: In Split view, the page is divided so you can see the code in one 
part of the workspace and a view of the how the page should be dis-
played in a Web browser in the other part.
 
✓ Design: In Design view, you see only the page as it should be displayed 
in a Web browser.
In Dreamweaver’s Split view, Code and Design views are completely inte-
grated. If you select something in Design view — say, the headline shown in 
Figure 1-1 — then you see the same text highlighted in Code view, enabling 
you to find your place easily in the code.
If (at first glance) you think that XHTML code looks like hieroglyphics, don’t 
give up too quickly. With just a little training, you can start to recognize at 
least some common tags, such as the <h1> tag (heading 1 tag) used to format 
the headline on the page shown in Figure 1-2.

Here are a few points to help you better understand XHTML:
 
✓ In XHTML, all tags must include the closing slash. A few tags can stand 
alone — for example, the <br /> tag, which adds a line break. As a rule, 
XHTML tags must have a closing tag, even if there’s only one tag, and 
close tags always contain a forward slash (/). Thus the line-break tag 
looks like <br> in HTML and like <br /> in XHTML.
 
✓ XHTML includes many tags that are designed to be hierarchical. 
Examples are the <h1> (heading 1) through <h6> (heading 6) tags, 
which are ideally suited to formatting text according to its importance 
on a Web page. Reserve the <h1> tag for the most important text on the 
page, such as the top headline. <h2> is ideal for subheads or secondary 
headings, <h3> for the third level of headings, and so on. A headline for-
matted with the <h1> tag looks like this:
<h1>This is a headline</h1>
 
✓ Some tags are more complex, and the open and close tags don’t 
always match. More complicated tags, such as the tags used to create 
links or insert images into pages, are more challenging to use because 
they include link information, and the close tag doesn’t always match 
the open tag. For example, the code to create a link to another Web site 
looks like this: 
<a href=”http://www.digitalfamily.com”>This is a link 
to DigitalFamily.com</a>
 
At its heart, XHTML is just text — and believe it or not, you can write XHTML 
in a plain-text editor as simple as Notepad, SimpleText, or TextEdit. If you ever 
try it, however, you have to be careful to type all the code perfectly because 
there is no room for error or typos in XHTML. After writing code yourself, 
even to create a simple page, you’re sure to quickly appreciate how well 
Dreamweaver writes the code for you.

 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
Comparing Static and Dynamic Sites
The first step to building a site is choosing what kind of site you want to 
build. This section introduces you to methods for building different features 
on the Web.
To start, know that Web sites fall into two very broad categories: static Web 
sites, which are generally built with a program like Adobe Dreamweaver, and 
dynamic Web sites, which use advanced programming to create advanced, 
interactive features, such as those used in a WordPress blog (covered in 
more detail in Chapter 13). Keep in mind that you can add multimedia, video, 
audio, animation, and so on to either type of site.
Static Web sites are made up of a collection of individual pages with the .html 
or .htm extension. You might think that all Web sites are made up of individual 
pages (and in a way they are), but with static sites those pages are saved as 
separate files. With a dynamic site, as you discover a little later in this section, 
the pages you view in a Web browser are created dynamically as they are deliv-
ered to the browser, so they’re not saved as individual pages but as pieces of 
pages that can be mixed and matched. That gives dynamic sites many advan-
tages, but it also makes them a lot more complicated to create.
 
The upshot is this: Because dynamic Web sites are more complicated to 
create, if you’re just creating a simple profile or small business site, go with 
a static site. Dynamic sites are often not worth the extra effort, unless you’re 
creating a site that you expect to grow to more than 100 pages or so. The big 
exception is a blogging site, because — thanks to specialized blogging tools 
like WordPress — creating a dynamic site with the common features of a blog 
is relatively easy. As a result, many people create both a static Web site for 
their profile or small business and a blog where they can easily add posts and 
other updates over time.
How Web browsers work
Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, Chrome, and Safari are designed to 
decipher HTML, XHTML, CSS, AJAX, and other 
code — and display the corresponding text, 
images, and multimedia on a computer screen. 
Essentially, browsers read the code in a Web 
page and interpret how to display the page to 
visitors. Unfortunately, because Web brows-
ers are created by different companies and the 
code they display has evolved dramatically over 
the years, not all Web browsers display Web 
pages the same way. Differences in browser 
display can lead to unpredictable (and often 
frustrating) results because a page that looks 
good in one browser may be unreadable in 
another. For more information on browser dif-
ferences and testing your pages to make sure 
they look good to all your visitors, see Chapter 4.

You find an introduction to using Dreamweaver’s dynamic development tools 
and how Dreamweaver can be used to edit sites created with blogging tools 
and other content management programs, in Chapter 13. If you’re interested 
in learning more about WordPress, check out WordPress For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
Static Web pages
Static pages work well for small and medium-sized Web sites, such as a 
professional profile or online gallery. Because static Web pages are writ-
ten in plain text, you can create them in a program as simple as Notepad or 
SimpleText, although tools such as Dreamweaver make designing pages a lot 
easier because you don’t have to remember all the cryptic XHTML tags. 
A static Web site offers a few advantages, especially if you’re just starting out, 
including the following:
 
✓ Easy to learn to develop: Anyone who can resize a photo has a head 
start on the skills needed to create and arrange graphic elements on a 
static page. 
 
✓ Gives you complete control over design of each page: You can tweak 
the size, colors, fonts, and arrangement of the elements on each page 
individually, and you can edit templates for these kinds of sites more 
easily than the templates for dynamic sites. 
 
✓ Easy to build, test, and publish to a Web server: You can create and 
test static Web pages on any personal computer and then host them on 
any commercial Web server — and you need only FTP access (which is 
built-in to programs like Dreamweaver) to publish pages to the Internet. 
Dynamic Web pages
The technical aspects of dynamic sites get complicated quickly. You find a 
more detailed introduction to creating dynamic Web sites in Chapter 13, but 
the gist is that instead of creating a collection of individual pages, you store 
all your content in a way that makes text, images, and other data easy to 
display in a variety of combinations. That’s what enables shopping sites like 
Amazon.com to keep track of your last order and recommend books when 
you return. 
A site can even gather information from different sources to create complex 
pages dynamically. For example, you can combine information about custom-
ers’ shopping habits with a list of your overstocked items currently on sale — 
and create a page tailored to each visitor. 

19
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
Dynamic sites are generally created on a Web server by combining CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets, introduced in Chapter 5) and XHTML (HTML that 
complies with today’s stricter standards) with more advanced technologies, 
such as PHP, ASP.NET, or ColdFusion. And that brings up another big chal-
lenge of working on dynamic sites: You have to build and test dynamic pages 
on a computer that runs a Web server and other software (for example, a 
database), which is a lot more complicated than simply installing a Web 
browser on your personal PC to test your pages. Launching a dynamic site 
on a commercial Web server is also far more complicated than publishing a 
static page site to a Web server. (You find more information about setting up 
your computer to create and edit dynamic Web sites in Chapter 13.)
That said, the advantages of dynamic Web sites are significant, and most big 
sites on the Web are created this way, but most of the big sites on the Web 
also have a team of experienced programmers behind them. Unless you have 
advanced programming skills or a big budget, the challenges of creating a 
dynamic Web site mean that most small- and medium-sized Web sites are still 
better served with static Web sites. 
Most of this book is dedicated to helping you create static sites — but that 
doesn’t mean you can’t get many of the same benefits of dynamic sites, such 
as the capability to update pages quickly. As you find in this book, you can 
combine CSS (covered in Chapters 5 and 6) with Dreamweaver’s .dwt tem-
plate features (covered in detail in Chapter 7) and get many features of a big-
budget Web site without all the complicated programming skills. (You find a 
general description of Dreamweaver’s template features, as well as a look at 
the differences among templates, in the next section of this chapter.)
Blogging is one exception to the general statement that static sites are easier 
to create than dynamic sites. Although blogging tools (such as WordPress 
and Blogger) create dynamic Web sites with all advanced capabilities, they 
do it in a way that makes such sites relatively easy to launch and update. 
 
Although you can use Dreamweaver to edit Joomla! and WordPress blog tem-
plates, that’s not as easy as you might imagine: Either you have to set up a 
Web server on your local computer and install these complex programs to run 
along with Dreamweaver, or you have to limit yourself to using Dreamweaver 
to do very limited editing — and then upload the edited files to the server to 
test them. (You find information on setting up your computer to work on sites 
created with WordPress and other content management systems — such as 
Joomla! — in Chapter 13.)
For these reasons, if you’re new to Web design, I recommend you start by 
creating a static site with Dreamweaver. And keep in mind: The skills you 
pick up in this book — in particular, creating and editing CSS and XHTML for 
static sties — also apply to dynamic sites. As you get more comfortable with 
creating and editing Web pages, you can apply skills gleaned from this book 
to more complex ways of creating sites.

20
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
The advantages of a dynamic site include these:
 
✓ Easily updated: When you want to put new content into a dynamic Web 
site, you can simply add a new product or image to the database and 
the new content automatically appears in all corresponding pages in the 
site. 
 
✓ Consistent look: When you create a dynamic site, you have to use tem-
plates, which help create a consistent look across the whole Web site. 
No matter how you build a site, having consistent navigation buttons, 
banners, and other essential elements is good practice because you 
want your visitors to find these items no matter which page they visit.
 
✓ Easier to redesign: All great Web sites grow and change over time, and 
as they get bigger, they become even more complex to redesign. With a 
dynamic site, you can simply update the templates, and the content is 
automatically included in the new version of the site. 
Working with Templates in Dreamweaver
The term template is used in many different ways for many different kinds 
of design work (on and off the Web), but essentially a template is a shortcut 
in the design process. By working with Dreamweaver templates, you can 
set or adjust just about any aspect of a site’s design or functionality, includ-
ing a header, logo, navigation bar, or sidebar. Whatever you include in a 
Multimedia: You like to move it, move it
I use the catch-all term multimedia to describe 
anything that moves on a Web page, but that’s 
a lot of different things these days. Multimedia 
should be considered as a topic distinct from 
static-versus-dynamic sites because video, 
audio, and images can be added to both static 
and dynamic Web pages.
You can add multimedia to a Web page in many 
different ways. In addition to video, there’s 
animation — whether you add it with Adobe Flash 
or Microsoft Silverlight, or simply animate a series 
of GIF images. AJAX, one of the newest ways to 
add interactivity to a site, combines JavaScript 
and XML — and is growing in popularity.
Fortunately, you don’t have to worry too much 
about all the technical details to add multi-
media to your Web pages. As described in 
Chapter 10, you can easily add many different 
kinds of audio and video formats using Adobe 
Dreamweaver. Or you can upload videos to 
a site such as YouTube or Vimeo, and then 
insert them into any Web page with copy-and-
paste ease. You find instructions for creating 
JavaScript features (such as rollover images), 
with Dreamweaver’s Behaviors in Chapter 9, 
and for using Dreamweaver’s Spry options 
to create AJAX features (such as drop-down 
menus) in Chapter 12.

21
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
Dreamweaver template, you can then apply to any new page based on the 
template — which automatically applies the settings you want to appear 
throughout your site. Moreover, if you want to adjust the overall settings 
in your site, you can make those updates once in the template, update your 
pages, and voilá — all pages based on the template are updated automatically.
But not all templates are created equally. Although they all share those basic 
characteristics, many different kinds of templates are in use on the Web 
today. For example, in Chapter 7, you find instructions for creating templates 
for static Web sites, but these are quite different from the kinds of templates 
you would use if you were creating a blog with WordPress. 
 
You can download many different kinds of templates from the Web, but 
they don’t all work in all programs. For example, if you download templates 
designed for Adobe Flash, you won’t be able to use them at all in Dreamweaver 
(although you can insert Flash files in Dreamweaver, as you discover in 
Chapter 10). Similarly, you can’t even view a WordPress template effectively in 
Dreamweaver unless you’ve set up a local server and installed WordPress.
You can edit many different kinds of templates in Dreamweaver. Before you 
start using Dreamweaver to create or edit templates, I think it’s helpful to 
better understand how they are different. The following sections cover two 
of the most common types of templates in use on the Web today (and what 
you should know about how they differ). See the nearby sidebar, “So many 
Dreamweaver template options,” for a complete list of template options.
Dreamweaver templates
Dreamweaver templates (extension .dwt) offer many advantages without 
requiring advanced programming skills. When you create Dreamweaver tem-
plates with the .dwt extension, you can use XHTML and CSS to create static 
Web sites that include many of the high-end features found on dynamic sites — 
such as the capability to create new pages quickly and to update every page 
in your site with the click of a button.
Although you can use Dreamweaver to create templates that use advanced 
programming (such as PHP or Java), the .dwt Dreamweaver template is a 
much simpler option that’s ideal for small- to medium-size Web sites — 
which is why I’ve dedicated much of Chapter 7 to making the most of 
Dreamweaver templates.
WordPress and Joomla! templates
Templates such as the ones you get with a blogging program like WordPress 
use the extension .php because they’re written in the PHP (Hypertext 

22
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Preprocessor) programming language. Although you can create PHP pages 
and templates in Dreamweaver and use them for more than just WordPress, 
these types of files are far more complex to create than .dwt Dreamweaver 
templates.
Because so many people use WordPress and so many sites offer WordPress 
template downloads, many people are confused about why WordPress tem-
plates don’t work in Dreamweaver in the same way that .dwt Dreamweaver 
templates work.
Dreamweaver supports many kinds of technolo-
gies, as well as the templates that go with each. 
When you create new pages in Dreamweaver 
by choosing File➪New, you have the option 
of create a blank page or a blank template, as 
shown in this figure.
When you create a simple HTML template, 
Dreamweaver uses the .dwt extension (see 
the nearby “Dreamweaver templates” section 
in this chapter).
Dreamweaver also supports Microsoft ASP and 
ASP.NET, and you can create templates using 
either ASP JavaScript or ASP VBScript (both of 
which use the .asp extension) — or you can 
use ASP.NET C# or VB (which use the .aspx 
extension).
The templates for a site created using Java end 
in .jsp. And if you use Adobe’s ColdFusion 
technology, your templates end in .cfm.
The big lesson is this: Make sure you have the 
right kind of template for the kind of site you’re 
creating — and rest assured that Dreamweaver 
supports just about any kind of technology you 
can use to create a Web site today.
So many Dreamweaver template options

23
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
WordPress templates offer many of the same benefits as Dreamweaver 
templates — except that templates for blogs such as WordPress draw their 
content from a database. As a result, they include XHTML and CSS (as do the 
Dreamweaver templates), plus much more complicated code in the PHP pro-
gramming language — which describes how content from the database should 
be displayed in a Web page. As a result, to make WordPress templates work 
in Dreamweaver, you must first install additional software, such as the MySQL 
database — as well as server software that essentially turns your computer 
into a Web server — so your browser can generate WordPress pages the same 
way a commercial Web server does. (See Chapter 13 for an introduction to how 
to work with WordPress blogs and other dynamic Web sites.)
Although creating a basic blog with a WordPress template is easy, editing a 
WordPress template is not so easy. Because that underlying technology is so 
complicated, changing the fonts, colors, columns in a page layout, and so on 
is also complicated.
The gardening Web site www.GardenstoTables.com (featured in Figure 1-3) 
was created with a program called Joomla!. Similar to WordPress, Joomla! 
offers many types of templates and add-ons to make creating a dynamic Web 
site easier. These tools are ideal if you plan to create a large, complex site — 
especially one that you expect to grow into hundreds (or thousands) of pages 
over time. But remember: You can always start your site as a static site in 
Dreamweaver, and then graduate to a more complicated way of building a site 
(such as Joomla!) as your site grows.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Comparing Tables, Frames, and Layers
If you’ve already done a little Web design, you may be wondering what hap-
pened to some of the old ways of creating Web page layouts. For years, Web 
designers used the HTML feature called Tables to create page layouts. Then 
Frames came along, and many people were excited by the capability to dis-
play multiple pages in one browser window (which Frames and iFrames make 
possible). Then came Layers, which were especially popular among design-
ers because they seemed to offer precise design control.
Today, most professional designers agree that the best way to create a Web 
page design is to use XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language, a 
strict form of HTML) with Cascading Style Sheets, which are covered in detail 
in Chapters 5 and 6.
Over the years, all these other options have become less desirable except in 
a few special cases. In this section, you find a quick review of when tables, 
frames, and layers may still be useful.
Creating page designs with HTML tables
In the early days of Web design, most page layouts were on the Web were 
created with tables. By merging and splitting table cells and even adding 
background images, designers created complex Web designs with tables. CSS 
expands upon this concept by adding many new design options — including 
the capability to add precise margins and padding around elements, which 
offers better control of how and where background images appear. 
Figure 1-4 provides an example of an old-school site created with the HTML 
table tag. Most designers turn off table borders by setting the table border 
to 0 to create cleaner layouts, but in Figure 1-4, I’ve set the borders to 2 pixels 
so you can see the outline of the table. As you can see in Figure 1-4, table 
cells surround each of the photos and captions in this two-column layout — 
and I’ve merged the columns at the top of the design to make room for the 
banner image that spans the full width of the page. 
Although tables are no longer recommended for creating page layouts, 
they’re still considered the best way to format tabular data like that you’d 
find in a spreadsheet program. Thus you can use tables to format a con-
sistent collection of information — such as the list of trees for sale on the 
Dexter Tree Farm site, as shown in Figure 1-5.

26
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Although I recommend that you redesign sites like the one shown in Figure 1-4 
with CSS and <div> tags, I do understand that many designers still find it 
easier to create layouts with tables, and not everyone has time to redesign 
their Web sites right away. I have to admit, I’ve been guilty of leaving a few 
sites online designed with tables long after I knew better. That said, I recom-
mend using only CSS today for all your Web page layouts — except when 
you’re creating a layout for tabular data. Even then, I still urge you to use CSS 
to add any styling (such as background colors or padding) that you might 
want in your tables. In Chapter 8, you discover how to create tables like the 
one shown in Figure 1-5.
 
If you visit the site at www.chocolategamerules.com, you can view the 
code and see how the page in Figure 1-4 was created using <div> tags and 
CSS. (I explain how <div> tags work with CSS in Chapter 6.)
Considering design options 
with HTML frames
You won’t find any instructions in this book for creating Web sites that use 
frames, such as the Pink Flamingos site shown in Figure 1-6. Frames enable you 
to display multiple Web pages in one browser window. Among Web designers, 
frames are a little like those plastic pink flamingos stuck in the front yards of 
so many homes in South Florida: Some people love how kitsch they are, and 
others just think they’re tacky. Although frames are still used on the Web, most 
designers don’t like them because they can make navigation confusing.
 
Frames are also problematic because when you use frames, the URL at the top 
of a Web browser does not change, even when you click links and change the 
pages displayed within the frames. As a result, you can only bookmark (create 
a link to) the first page of a site that uses frames. Worse yet, search engines 
have a hard time properly indexing a site designed with frames — which can 
diminish your site’s search-engine ranking.
Using layers (or AP Divs) 
to create designs
In Dreamweaver MX, MX 2004, and 8, a Layer feature offered an easy way to 
click and drag boxes that designers could position with precision on a page. 
Starting in version CS3 and continuing in version CS5, Adobe changed the 
name to AP Divs. Divs are simply XHTML <div> tags that serve as dividers 
in a page. Essentially, they create boxes around content, where the content 

27
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
between the opening and closing <div> tags is considered a box. By orga-
nizing content in this way, designers can position sections of text or images 
independently. Don’t be confused by the fact that I (and most other Web 
designers today) recommend using <div> tags with CSS to create your page 
layouts. We just don’t recommend that you do so with the AP Divs (except in 
a few special cases).
AP Divs, as the name implies, are <div> tags that include styling information 
that adds absolute positioning. That means when you place an AP Div in a 
Web page, it stays where you put it, no matter how much space you have in 
the browser window. This may seem like a good idea at first — and AP Divs 
were popular among some designers for a while because they’re so easy to 
use and so similar to many features in desktop publishing programs (such 
as Adobe InDesign). But because AP Divs create such inflexible layouts, they 
don’t adapt well to the changing environment of the Web, where different-
size monitors and other display variations can lead to cut-off text and other 
undesirable results in AP Div–based designs.
 
Many designers use AP Divs on occasion to add immovable elements (such 
as a logo anchored to the top-left of a page) to a page layout, but creating an 
entire design with this feature is no longer recommended.

28
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Appreciating the Benefits of 
Cascading Style Sheets
The concept of creating styles has been around since long before the Web. 
Desktop publishing programs (such as Adobe InDesign) and even word pro-
cessing programs (such as Microsoft Word) have long used styles to manage 
the formatting and editing of text on printed pages. When using styles in a 
word processor, you can create and save styles for common features, such as 
headlines and captions. In print design, styles are great timesavers because 
they enable you to combine a collection of formatting options (such as Arial 
and bold and italic) into one style — and then apply all those options at once 
to any selected text in your document, using only a single style. The advan-
tage is that if you change a style, you can automatically apply the change 
everywhere you’ve used that style in a document.
On the Web, you can do all that and more with CSS — because you can use 
style sheets for more than just text formatting. For example, you can use 
CSS to create styles that align images to the left or right side of a page, add 
padding around text or images, and change background and link colors. You 
can even create more than one style sheet for the same page — say, one that 
makes your design look good on computers, another for cell phones, and a 
third for a printed page.
For all these reasons (and more), CSS has quickly become the preferred 
method of designing Web pages among professional Web designers. One of 
the most powerful aspects of CSS is that it enables you to make global style 
changes across an entire Web site. Suppose, for example, that you create a 
style for your headlines by redefining the <h1> tag to create large, blue, bold 
headlines. Then, one fine day, you decide that all your headlines should be red 
instead of blue. If you aren’t using CSS, changing all your headlines could be a 
huge undertaking — a matter of opening every Web page in your site to make 
changes to the font tags around every headline. But if you’re using CSS in an 
external style sheet, you can simply change the style that contains formatting 
information for the <h1> tag in the style sheet — and voilà! All your headlines 
all turn red automatically. If you ever have to redesign your site (and believe 
me, every good site goes through periodic redesigns), you can save hours (or 
even days) of work if you created your design with CSS in the first place.
A Web site designed with CSS separates content from design. Keeping the 
content of site (such as the text and headings) separate from the instruc-
tions that tell a browser how the content should look benefits both you as a 
designer and your site visitors. Here are some of the advantages:

29
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
 
✓ CSS simplifies design changes. CSS styles can be saved in the header 
section at the very top of an XHTML page, or they can be saved in a 
separate file that can be attached to multiple XHTML pages. Either way, 
if you use a style to format many headlines, you can make formatting 
changes by simply editing the style.
 
✓ Separating content from design enables you to create different style 
sheets for different audiences and devices. Today’s Web sites are as 
likely to be viewed on giant, wall-size screens as they are to be seen on 
screens small enough to hide in the palm of your hand during a lunch 
date. CSS makes enables you to create Web-page designs that are more 
adaptable so they look good on big and small screens, as well as every-
thing in between.
 
 As you get more advanced with CSS, you can even create multiple style 
sheets for the same Web page. For example, you can create one that’s 
ideally suited to a big computer monitor, another that’s designed to get 
the best results when page is printed, and yet another designed with a 
larger font size for anyone who may have trouble reading the small print 
that’s so common on Web pages.
 
✓ Using CSS makes your site comply with the current standards. Today, 
the W3C, which sets standards for the Internet, recommends using CSS 
for nearly every aspect of Web design because the best CSS designs are 
accessible, flexible, and adaptable.
 
✓ Web sites designed in CSS are accessible to more visitors. Today, a 
movement is growing among some of the best designers in the world to 
get everyone to follow the same standards, create Web sites with CSS, 
and make sure sites are accessible to everyone.
 
 When Web designers talk about accessibility, they mean creating a site 
that anyone who might ever visit your pages can access — including 
people with limited vision who use special browsers (often called screen 
readers) that read Web pages aloud, as well as many others who use spe-
cialized browsers for a variety of other reasons.
 
 If you work for a university, a nonprofit, a government agency, or a simi-
lar organization, you may be required to create accessible designs. Even 
if you’re not required to design for accessibility, know that pages that 
meet accessibility standards also tend to score better in search-engine 
rankings because accessible designs also enable search engines to 
access and interpret site content more easily. 

30
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Understanding Browser Differences
HTML was created to share information in a way that could be displayed on 
every computer on the planet — it’s one of the greatest advantages of the 
Web. However, for Web designers, this advantage is also a challenge because 
not all those computers use the same browsers, the same fonts, or the same 
monitor size. On top of that, a lot of older Web browsers that can’t display 
the latest Web features are still in use — and the newer browsers don’t all 
display those features in the same way. So before you start creating Web 
pages, know that no matter how carefully you create your designs, your 
pages will never look exactly the same to every possible visitor to your site.
 
If you want to create page designs using the latest technology, and you want to 
reach the broadest possible audience, pay special attention to Dreamweaver’s 
browser preview and compatibility features — and be prepared to move on to 
training that’s more advanced than this book. Entire books and Web sites are 
dedicated to creating highly complex CSS layouts that display well on various 
computers and browsers — and to combining CSS and other special code to 
make complex pages look good in older and newer Web browsers. They’re not 
for the casual user or the faint of heart. 
In Chapters 5 and 6, you find an introduction to creating styles and page 
designs with CSS. In Chapter 4, you find more information about browser dif-
ferences, as well as Dreamweaver’s testing and compatibility features, which 
can help ensure that your pages work well for a broad audience.
Introducing the Dreamweaver CS5 
Workspace
Dreamweaver can seem a bit overwhelming at first: It has so many features, 
spread among so many panels, toolbars, and dialog boxes that you can easily 
get lost. If you prefer to build an understanding by poking around, have at it 
(and feel free to skip to Chapter 2, where you start building your first Web 
page right away). If you want a tour before you get started, the last few sec-
tions of this chapter introduce you to the interface and give you a quick over-
view of the features in this powerful program.
When you launch Dreamweaver, the Welcome screen, shown in Figure 1-7, 
appears in the main area of the program (and reappears anytime you don’t 
have a file open, unless you close it by selecting the Don’t Show Again 
option). After you select an option on the Welcome screen (options explained 

31
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
in Chapter 2), Dreamweaver creates a new blank HTML page in the main 
workspace, the main area of the program where you design your page. The 
workspace consists mainly of a Document window, which displays the page 
you’re working on and is where you add text, images, and other elements 
that will appear on your Web pages. The Document window is surrounded 
by a collection of panels, toolbars, and menus that provide easy access to 
Dreamweaver’s many features. Details of these controls follow.
Changing workspace layouts
Dreamweaver CS5 has eight preset workspace layouts to choose from. These 
layouts arrange the many toolbars, panels, and other features in popular 
configurations. You can change layouts by choosing Window➪Workspace 
Layout and then choosing any of the listed layouts. Or choose a layout from 
the drop-down list at the top of the Dreamweaver window, such as Designer 
(which is selected in Figure 1-7) or App Developer (shown in Figure 1-8). 
There are eight total options, in three categories (Designer, App, and Coder), 
and variations on each.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
The Designer layouts were created for people who have a design background 
and favor the design features of the program. You can also choose the App 
and Coder layouts were created for programmers who are likely to prefer 
working in the Code view and having handy access to the coding features.
In addition to the preset workspace layouts, you can create your own by fol-
lowing these steps:
 
1. Open, close, or move any of the panels, inspectors, or other features, 
as described in the following sections. 
 
2. Choose Window➪Workspace Layout➪New Workspace.
 
3. Give your new workspace a name and click OK. 
 
 Your custom workspace is added to the Layout menu so you can easily 
reset the program to match your favorite settings. 
 
The name that the Layout menu displays will match the last layout you chose 
and used. If your last choice was Designer, it says Designer; if your last choice 
was Coder, it says Coder.
If you move a panel or inspector and then want to return it to its original 
location, use the Layout menu: Choose Reset and then choose the name of 
the workspace layout you want to restore.
 
Create a collection of workspace layouts optimized for common tasks, such as 
creating and applying CSS, or working with database content, and save them 
so you can easily arrange the program to best suit your preferences.
The menu bar
As with most programs you’ve used, the menu at the top of the screen pro-
vides easy access to most program features, including the options you find in 
the Insert bar, Property inspector, and panels, as well as a few others that are 
available only from the menu.
The Document toolbar
Across the top of the workspace, just under the menu bar and above the 
workspace, is the Document toolbar, as shown in Figure 1-8. Here you find 
the following options:
 
✓ Code, Split, and Design view buttons: Click a button to display only the 
code or design in the workspace, or both the code and the design using 
Split view (refer to Figure 1-8).

 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
 
✓ Live Code button: Provides a preview of the page in Live Code view, 
which is dynamic and provides an update of the page you’re interacting 
with in Live View.
 
✓ Live View button: Provides a preview of the page, complete with work-
ing links and dynamic content; the page works in Dreamweaver much as 
it would when previewed in a Web browser. 
 
✓ Inspect button (new in version CS5): Helps you identify and trouble-
shoot CSS.
 
✓ Preview in Browser button: Launches the page in a Web browser.
 
✓ View Options button: Provides access to additional display features, 
such as the ruler and guides.
 
✓ Visual Aids button: Makes turning on special display features (such as 
CSS Layout Outlines) easy. The CSS Layout Outlines option adds a thin, 
dotted line around otherwise-invisible elements (such as <div> tags). 
 
✓ Title field: Displays the page title, which is the text that appears at the 
top of a browser window when a page is displayed. This is also the text 
that’s saved when a visitor bookmarks a page.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
The Document window
The big, open section in the main area of the workspace is the Document 
window, which is where you work on new and existing pages. 
 
If you use the Designer workspace layout, the Document window is displayed 
in Split view, showing the code on the left and the Design view on the right. 
To change the Split view from left-right to top-bottom, choose View➪Split 
Vertically to deselect the Split Vertically option (which is selected by default 
in version CS5). If you want to hide the code to focus only on your design, 
click the Design view button in the Document toolbar. 
The docking panels
The docking panels are located to the right of the work area when you 
choose any of the Designer layouts (such as the one shown in Figure 1-7), or 
on the left when you choose any of the Developer layouts (such as the one 
shown in Figure 1-8).
The docking panels display a variety of important features in Dreamweaver, 
including the following:
 
✓ The Insert panel, described in detail in the following section.
 
✓ The Files panel, which displays all the files and folders in a site.
 
✓ The CSS Styles panel, which displays a list of all the Cascading Style 
Sheets available to the document.
You work with the panels in the following ways:
 
✓ To open and close panels, click the gray bar at the top of any panel next 
to the panel’s name or double-click the name in the tab at the top of the 
panel.
 
✓ To move panels anywhere on the screen, click the dark gray bar at the 
top of the panel and drag it to the desired location.
 
✓ To display more panels, select the panel name from the Window menu.
 
✓ To expand or collapse all the visible panels at once, click the double 
arrow at the top-right corner of the topmost panel.
 
✓ To expand or collapse a single panel when the panel collection is col-
lapsed, click the name of the panel, as shown in Figure 1-9.

The Insert panel
The Insert panel, located at the top of the panel section, includes seven sub-
categories, each with a different set of icons representing common features. 
Click the small arrow to the right of the name to access the drop-down list 
and switch from the buttons of one subcategory to the buttons for another. 
The options are
 
✓ Common Insert panel: Displays icons for many of the most common fea-
tures, including links, tables, and images.
 
✓ Layout Insert panel: Displays Div, Table, and Frame options (essential 
for creating page layouts).
 
✓ Forms Insert panel: Features the most common form elements, such as 
radio buttons and boxes.
 
✓ Data Insert panel: Displays options for building dynamic Web pages 
powered by database material.
 
✓ Spry Insert panel: Features a collection of widgets that combine HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive page elements, such as drop-
down lists and collapsible panels.
 
✓ InContext Editing Insert panel: Displays features that are handy for cre-
ating Repeating and Editable Regions, as well as managing CSS classes, 
when working with dynamic content.

36
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
✓ Text Insert panel: Displays common text-formatting features, including 
paragraphs, breaks, and lists.
 
✓ Favorites Insert panel: Enables you to right-click (Windows) or Control-
click (Mac) to add any icons from the other Insert bar options as a favor-
ite, so you can create your own collection of favorite features.
At the end of the drop-down list are the two options that control the display 
of the list of options in the Insert panels. Color Icons restores the color to 
the icons. Hide Labels/Show Labels enables you to display the names of the 
Insert panel features next to each icon, or to remove the names. 
The Property inspector
The Property inspector is docked at the bottom of the workspace in 
Dreamweaver. If you prefer, you can click the gray bar at the top of the 
inspector and drag it to detach it so it floats in the workspace. You can 
move the inspector anywhere on the screen or you can drag and dock it 
in the panel group. When you dock the Property inspector with the other 
panels, you can expand and collapse it just as you would any other panels. 
To restore the inspector to its original location, choose Window➪Workspace 
Layout➪Reset. (I rather like that the Property inspector is handy, yet out of 
the way, at the bottom of the screen.)
The Property inspector displays the properties, or options, for any selected 
element on a page, and it changes based on what’s selected. For example, if 
you click an image, the Property inspector displays image properties. If you 
click a Flash file, the Property inspector displays Flash properties.
For many elements, the Property inspector is split into two sections, one for 
HTML features and the other for CSS. Use the CSS and HTML buttons on the 
left side of the Property inspector (as shown in Figure 1-10) to switch from 
one to the other. (You find detailed instructions for how to use these two 
modes of the Property inspector in Chapters 5 and 6.)

bar and the

37
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
 
At the bottom-right corner of the Property inspector, you see a small arrow. 
Click this arrow to reduce or expand the inspector to hide or reveal additional 
attributes, such as the image map options when a graphic is selected. Click 
the gray bar at the top of the inspector to close and open the inspector.
The status bar
The status bar is located at the bottom of the Document window and just 
above the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 1-10. The status bar 
includes access to a number of features that control the display of a page in 
Dreamweaver’s workspace:
 
✓ Tag selector: On the far left of the status bar, as shown in the top of 
Figure 1-10, you find the tag selector, which displays the HTML tags 
and CSS rules that apply to any selected element on the page. In Figure 
1-10, the cursor is inside a text block that’s formatted with the <h1> tag, 
which is inside a <div> tag with a #container ID, which is inside the 
<body> tag. 
 
• Clicking any tag in the tag selector selects the tag and all its con-
tents in the workspace. 
 
• Right-clicking (Control-clicking on a Mac) a tag opens a pop-up 
menu with options to add or remove tags and CSS rules.
 
✓ Select tool, Hand tool, Zoom tool, and Magnification pop-up menu: 
You can use these tools, which are toward the middle of the status bar, 
to move, enlarge, or reduce the display of a page in the workspace.
 
✓ Download Size/Download Time tool: Found on the far-right side of the 
status bar, this tool displays the total size of the Web page, including 
all images and other elements on the page — and the estimated time 
downloading the page will take, based on the connection speed speci-
fied in Dreamweaver’s preferences. By default, the connection speed is 
set to estimate the download time of a page over a 56K modem, but you 
can change it to a faster or slower speed by changing the preferences, as 
shown in the following section.
Changing preference settings
The more you use Dreamweaver, the more you’re likely to appreciate how 
readily you can customize its features. Remember that you can always 
change the workspace to better suit the way you like to work, and you can 
easily alter Dreamweaver’s preference settings using the Preferences 
dialog box.

38
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences on a Windows 
computer, or Dreamweaver➪Preferences on a Mac. Dreamweaver includes 
19 different categories in the Preferences dialog box and makes it possible to 
change the appearance, default settings, and many other options throughout 
the program.

W
hether you’re building a new site or need to make changes to an 
existing site, this chapter is the place to start. Here you discover an 
important preliminary step: the site setup process that enables Dreamweaver 
to keep track of the images and links in your site. After you complete the site 
setup process, you’re ready to create Web pages, insert text and images, set 
links, and more. (You find instructions for doing all those things in this chap-
ter, too.) But whatever you do, don’t skip the first step of defining a site — it 
only takes a minute or two.
 
Although you can use Dreamweaver without doing this initial site setup, you 
run the risk of breaking links when you publish your site using the built-in FTP 
features. Other features, such as templates, automated link checking, and the 
Library, won’t work at all.
 
The best approach to Web design with Dreamweaver is to first create a Web 
site on your computer’s hard drive, where you use Dreamweaver’s preview 
options to test the site in any browser on your computer before you publish it 
on the Internet. That’s why this chapter starts with setting up a folder on your 
hard drive where you’ll keep your site files. When you’re ready to publish the 
completed site, you transfer it to a Web server. A Web server is a computer with 
a permanent connection to the Internet and special software that enables it to 
communicate with Web browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. Find 
detailed instructions for previewing and publishing a Web site in Chapter 4.

40
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Setting Up a New or Existing Site
To set up a site in Dreamweaver, you need to store all your site’s resources 
in one main folder on your hard drive. Dreamweaver calls this the local site 
folder, and when you set up a new site, you essentially just identify that folder 
in Dreamweaver. The site setup process is a crucial first step because all 
the elements of your site must remain in the same relative location on your 
hard drive as they are on your Web server in order for your links, images, 
and other elements to work properly. Identifying the local site folder on your 
computer helps Dreamweaver set all your links properly and ensure they still 
work when you publish your site to a Web server (which you discover how to 
do in Chapter 4).
 
In earlier versions of Dreamweaver, the local site folder was called the local 
root folder and the site setup process was called the Site Definition process.
The Site Setup dialog box also contains a category called Servers (on the 
left side) where you can set up your site to use Dreamweaver’s file transfer 
features, including its FTP (File Transfer Protocol) capabilities. (FTP is a 
common method of copying files to and from computers connected across a 
network, such as the Internet.) To keep things simple for now, you can skip 
all the categories except the Site category covered in the section that follows. 
In Chapter 4, you find detailed instructions for using Dreamweaver’s pub-
lishing features as well as instructions for downloading an existing Web site 
hosted on a remote server.
If the site setup process seems a little confusing at first, don’t worry; it’s a 
quick, relatively painless process that you must do only once for each site, 
but it’s a crucial first step and it’s important not to skip it.
Whether you’re creating a new site or working on an existing site for the first 
time in Dreamweaver, the following steps walk you through the process of 
defining the local site folder, a folder or directory, where you store all the 
images, text, and other files in your site.
 
1. Choose Site➪New Site.
 
 The Site Setup dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Site tab.
 
 When you open the Site Setup dialog box, the Site tab should already be 
selected by default. This dialog box contains three other tabs, as shown 
in Figure 2-1, but you don’t need to open any of them to complete the 
basic site setup process.

41
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
Figure 2-1: 
Use the Site 
Setup dialog 
box to com-
plete the set 
up process 
and identify 
the local 
site folder 
for any new 
Web site 
in Dream-
weaver.
 
 
3. In the Site Name text box, type a name for your site.
 
 You can call your site whatever you like; this name is used only to help 
you keep track of your sites in Dreamweaver. Many people work on 
more than one Web site, and the name you enter here is the name also 
listed in the Files panel, where you select which site you want to work 
on in Dreamweaver, which is why it’s helpful to use a name that will help 
you identify the site later. (The next section discusses moving among 
sites via the Files panel in more detail.)
 
 
4. Click the Browse button (which it looks like a file folder) next to the 
Local Site Folder text box and browse your hard drive to locate the 
folder you want to serve as the main folder for all the files in your 
Web site.
 
 If you’re working on an existing site, select the folder that already con-
tains the files for that site. If you’re creating a new site, you can create a 
new folder as follows:
 
• In Windows: Click the Create New Folder icon at the top of the 
Choose Root Folder dialog box.
 
• In Mac OS X: Click the New Folder button at the bottom of the 
Choose Root Folder dialog.
 
 The goal is to simply select the folder so that Dreamweaver can identify 
where all the files and folders for your site will be stored. When you’ve 
completed this step, the name of the folder and the path to that folder’s 
location on your hard drive, appear in the Local Site Folder field.

42
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
5. Click Save to close the Site Setup dialog box and save your settings.
 
 If the folder you selected as your local site folder already contains files 
or folders, they’re automatically cached and all the files and folders 
in your site are displayed in the Files panel. As you see in Figure 2-2, I 
already had many files in my Dexter Tree Farm site, so they are listed in 
the Files panel. If I were creating a new site with a new empty folder, the 
Files panel would only contain the main site folder.
 
 If you haven’t checked the Enable Cache option, a message box appears 
asking whether you want to create a cache for the site. Choose Yes to 
speed up Dreamweaver’s site management features.
 
Figure 2-2: 
When site 
setup is 
complete, 
the files 
and folders 
in an exist-
ing site are 
displayed 
in the Files 
panel. 
 
Switching Among Sites
You can set up as many sites as you like in Dreamweaver and change from 
one site to another by selecting the site name in the Files panel. To load a dif-
ferent site into the Files panel, use the drop-down arrow next to the site name 
and choose the name of the site you want to display.
In Figure 2-3, I’m selecting the DigitalFamily.com site from a list of defined 
sites. When you select a site, the files in that site replace the ones of any cur-
rently open site in the Files panel. Selecting a site in the Files panel before 
you start working on it is always best.

Managing Sites in Dreamweaver
After you complete the site setup process covered in the preceding exer-
cise, you can make changes and additions to a site setup by choosing 
Site➪Manage Sites, selecting the name of the site in the Manage Sites dialog 
box. Use the buttons on the right to manage your site as follows:
 
✓ New: Click this button to define a new site. (The process is the same as 
choosing Site➪New Site, as explained in “Setting Up a New or Existing 
Site,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Edit: Clicking Edit opens the site in the Site Setup dialog box, where 
you can change the name by replacing whatever you entered in the 
Site Name field and change the local site folder by clicking the Browse 
button and selecting a different folder. In Figure 2-4, I selected the 
DigitalFamily.com site and am about to click the Edit button to open it.
 
✓ Duplicate: Clicking Duplicate makes a copy of the site setup, but does 
not actually make a new copy of the site on your hard drive. 
 
✓ Remove: When you remove a site from the Manage Sites dialog box, you 
don’t delete the site’s files or folders from your hard drive; you simply 
remove the site setup in Dreamweaver.
 
✓ Import and Export: These buttons are designed to make it easy to share 
the site setup information for a site among multiple computers. When 
you click Export, Dreamweaver creates a .ste file. This is not a copy of 
the files and folders in a site; it’s a copy of the information stored in the 
Site Setup dialog box, including any server, FTP, or other information 
you have entered for the site. The Import button lets you import a .ste 
file to add any site that has already been set up in Dreamweaver.

Creating New Pages
Every Web site begins with a single page. Visitors are first greeted by the 
front page — or home page — of your site, and that’s usually a good place to 
start building. 
Dreamweaver makes creating new pages easy: You can work from the 
Welcome screen or use the New Document window, which provides more 
options. The following sections explain both methods, and you find details 
about the best names to use for new pages so that they’ll work well when you 
publish your site to the Web.
Starting from the Welcome screen
When you open Dreamweaver, a Welcome screen greets you with shortcuts 
to many handy features for creating new pages in a variety of formats:
 
✓ If you want to create a simple, blank Web page, choose HTML from the 
Create New list in the middle column (see Figure 2-5). Remember that 
choosing HTML doesn’t mean that you have to write the HTML code 
yourself. Rather, you’re just telling Dreamweaver that you want to create 
a page written only with HTML, not of one of the more complex technol-
ogies, such as PHP or ASP.net. You still have the option to work in the 
code editor or the visual editor and let Dreamweaver write the underly-
ing HTML for you.
 
✓ If you’re creating a dynamic site, choose ColdFusion, PHP, or one of the 
other dynamic site options. (If you don’t even know what those options 
mean, you probably won’t need to use them yet, but you can find some 
information about these advanced options in Chapter 13.)

45
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites

The 
Welcome 
screen pro-
vides a list 
of shortcuts 
for creating 
new files 
or opening 
existing 
pages in 
Dream-
weaver.
 
 
If you prefer not to use the Welcome screen, you can turn it off by selecting 
the Don’t Show Again box in the bottom-left corner.
Creating an HTML page with 
the New Document window
You can also create a new HTML page by using the New Document window, 
which offers more options than the Welcome screen, including access to any 
templates you’ve created with Dreamweaver (covered in Chapter 7), as well 
as a collection of predesigned layouts, which can give you a head start on 
your designs. 
 
You can create many different kinds of files using the New Document window, 
and you can mix and match some, but not all, of the options. This can be 
confusing at first, but essentially, if you choose an option under Page Types 
that creates a Web page, including HTML, HTML Template, or any of the ASP, 
ColdFusion, JSP, or PHP options, you can also choose one of the page layouts 
from the Layout list. If you choose any of the other options, such as Library, 
CSS, JavaScript or XMTL, the layout options are not available because you 
would not include a layout in any of these types of files. Also note that the lay-
outs are all created with CSS, which Dreamweaver as it creates the new page. 
You read more about editing the CSS to change these layouts in Chapter 6.
To create a new, completely blank HTML file, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens, as shown in Figure 2-6.

46
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
2. From the left side of the screen, select Blank Page.
 
3. From the Page Type list, select HTML.
 
4. From the Layout section, choose <none>.
 
5. Use the drop-down list next to DocType if you want to change the 
document type.
 
 By default, Dreamweaver creates pages using the XHTML Transitional 
doctype, which is the best option for most Web pages today. If you are 
working on a site that requires you create strict HTML pages, however, 
make sure to change this setting.
 
6. Click Create.
 
 The New Document window closes, and a new blank page is created and 
opened in the workspace.
 
 In this example, I’m creating a blank page by choosing <none>, but I 
often start new pages by using one of Dreamweaver’s many great lay-
outs. You find instructions for creating and editing pages with these lay-
outs in Chapter 6.
 
7. Choose File➪Save to save your page and give it a filename.
 
 In general, you should not include spaces or special characters in file 
names in your Web site (although the dash and underscore are okay). 
For more on how best to name files and folders in your Web site, see the 
upcoming sections “Naming new page files” and “Naming the first page 
index.html.”
 
 Get in the habit of saving new Web pages in your local site folder as 
soon as you create them, even though the pages are still blank. As you 
create links or add images to your pages, Dreamweaver needs to be able 
to identify the location of your page within your site folder. Although 
Dreamweaver sets temporary links until your page is saved, saving a 
page first is best because many other Dreamweaver features won’t work 
until a page is saved.
Naming new page files
Over the years, I’ve received many e-mail messages from panicked Web 
designers because of broken links caused by filename conflicts. Because 
these problems usually don’t occur until after a Web site is published on a 
server, they can be especially confusing and difficult to understand. If you’re 
publishing your Web site to a Web server that runs on Mac or Windows, the 
following may not apply to you; but if you’re using a Web server that runs 

47
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
Unix or Linux (which is what many commercial Web hosting companies use), 
the following instructions are especially important. If you’re not sure, follow 
these rules when you save Web pages, images, and other files on your site to 
be safe:
 
✓ Include an extension at the end to identify the file type (such as 
.html for HTML files or .gif for GIF images). Dreamweaver automati-
cally adds the .html file extension to the end of HTML files, which 
works for most Web servers. [However, in the rare case that you need 
to change the extension to .htm for your Web server, you can do so in 
Dreamweaver’s Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit➪Preferences 
(Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac).] See the “Showing file 
extensions in Windows” sidebar for tips on how to view file extensions, 
which are hidden in Windows.
 
✓ Don’t use spaces or special characters in filenames. For example, don’t 
name a Web page with an apostrophe, such as cat’s meow page.
html. If you want to separate words, you can use the underscore (_) 
or the hyphen (-). For example, meow-page.html is a fine filename. 
Numbers are okay in most cases, and although capital letters don’t 
generally matter, most designers stick with lowercase to keep filenames 
consistent and making setting and checking links easier because the 
name of the file and its reference in any links must match.

options 
when creat-
ing a new

as starting

Layouts.
 

48
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
The reason for all this fuss? Filenames are especially important in Web sites 
because they’re included in the HTML code when you set links. Links with 
spaces and special characters work just fine when you test pages on a Mac or a 
PC computer, but many Web servers on the Internet use software that doesn’t 
understand spaces or special characters in links. Thus, links that don’t follow 
these rules may get broken when you publish the site to a Web server. By fol-
lowing these rules, you ensure that the filename and the code in the link match.
Naming the first page index.html
Another confusing rule — and one of the most important — is that the main 
page (or the front page) of your Web site must be called index.html (on some 
Windows-based servers, the first page should be named default.html). 
Showing file extensions in Windows
Unless you change the settings, you won’t see 
the file extension of your GIFs, JPEGs, or HTML 
pages on a Windows computer (although these 
extensions will be displayed in the Files panel 
in Dreamweaver).
To change these settings, open the Folder 
Options dialog box, as shown in the following 
figure, choose the View tab, and then look 
through the long list of options and deselect 
Hide Extensions for Known File Types. How you 
open the Folder Options dialog box depends on 
which version of Windows you’re using; but if 
you search for Folder Options in the Help sec-
tion, you should find it easily.

49
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
That’s because most servers are set up to serve the index.html or 
default.html page first.
Essentially, when a Web browser comes to a domain name, such as 
DigitalFamily.com, the first page that opens is index.html. Similarly, when 
a Web browser is directed to a subfolder within a site, it also displays the 
index page first. As a result, if you create a subfolder with the name books, 
for example, and inside that subfolder you create page named index.html 
as the main page, you can tell visitors to your site to simply enter www.
DigitalFamily.com/books to arrive at the books page within your site. If you 
name the first page anything else, such as books.html, visitors have to type 
www.DigitalFamily.com/books/books.html to open the page. The rest of the 
pages in your site can be named anything you like, as long as the names don’t 
include any spaces or special characters (except the hyphen or underscore).
 
It doesn’t matter if you use upper- or lowercase letters when typing a 
domain name, but everything that comes after the .com (or .net, or 
whatever three- ending your domain name has) must match the case 
of the file and folder names. Thus, www.DigitalFamily.com and 
www.digitalfamily.com are the same, but if you create a folder named 
books with a lowercase b, the address typed into a browser must use a low-
ercase b, as in www.DigitalFamily.com/books and if someone enters 
www.DigitalFamily.com/Books in a browser, they will get a 404 error.
Bestowing a page title
 
When you create new pages, adding a page title right away is also good prac-
tice. A page title is the text that appears in the title bar when a visitor opens 
your site in a browser window. 
In Dreamweaver, you can add a page title by changing the text in the Title 
box at the top of the workspace. This detail is easy to forget, but page titles 
play an important role in your site’s appearance as well as behind the scenes:
 
✓ The title won’t appear in the main part of your Web page, but it does 
appear at the top of a browser window, usually just to the right or left 
of the name of the browser. Pages on the Web look unfinished when the 
words untitled document appear at the top of the browser window.
 
✓ The page title is also the text that appears in a user’s Favorites or 
Bookmarks list.
 
✓ Many search engines give special priority to the words that appear in 
the title of a Web page, so including the name of your site and a few key-
words can help you score better in search results.

Changing Page-Wide Styles with 
the Page Properties Dialog Box
You can change many individual elements on a page in the Property inspec-
tor. If you want to make changes that affect the entire page — such as chang-
ing the background color of the entire page or changing the way links and 
text are formatted — use the Page Properties dialog box.
As shown in Figure 2-7, the Page Properties dialog box includes a list of cat-
egories on the left. Each of these reveals different options for specifying page 
settings. Some of these options are covered in other parts of the book, such 
as the Background Image feature, covered in Chapter 3.
Changing background and text colors
The following section focuses on changing the background and the text 
colors available from the Appearance categories, as shown in Figure 2-7. Note 
that the CSS options are recommended over HTML options. When you use 
the Appearance (CSS) options, Dreamweaver creates corresponding styles 
for the body tag automatically.
 
Figure 2-7: 
The 
Appearance 
(CSS) cat-
egory in 
the Page 
Properties 
dialog box 
enables you 
to specify 
text color, 
font face, 
font size, 
background, 
and 
margins.
 
 
Although you can apply global settings, such as text size and color, in the Page 
Properties dialog box, you can override those settings with other formatting 
options in specific instances. For example, you could set all your text to 

51
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
Helvetica in Page Properties and then change the font for an individual head-
line to Arial with the Font field in the Property inspector.
To change the font settings, background and text colors, and page margins 
for an entire page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
 
 The Appearance (CSS) category of the Page Properties dialog box 
appears (see Figure 2-7).
 
2. In the Page Font drop-down list, specify the fonts you want for the text 
on your page.
 
 In this example, I set the font face to the collection that begins with the 
Georgia font. If you don’t specify a font, your text appears in the font 
specified in your user’s browser, which is usually Times.
 
3. If you want all the text on your page to appear bold or italic, click the 
B or I (respectively) to the right of the Page Font drop-down list.
 
 If you select one of these options, all your text appears bold or italic in 
the page.
 
4. In the Size drop-down list, specify the font size you want for the text 
on your page.
 
 Again, you can override these settings for any text on the page.
 
5. Click the Text Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. Choose 
any color you like.
 
 The color you select fills the color swatch box but won’t change the text 
color on your page until you click the Apply or OK button.
 
6. Click the Background Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. 
Choose any color you like.
 
 The color you selected fills the color swatch box. The color doesn’t fill 
the background until you click the Apply or OK button.
 
7. If you want to insert a graphic or photograph into the background of 
your page, click the Browse button next to the Background Image box 
and select the image in the Select Image Source dialog box.
 
 When you insert a background image, it automatically repeats or tiles 
across and down the page unless you choose the No-Repeat option from 
the Repeat drop-down list or use CSS to further define the display.
 
8. Use the margin options at the bottom of the dialog box to change the 
left, right, top, or bottom margins of your page.
 
 Entering 0 in all four of these fields removes the default margin settings 
that automatically add margin space at the top and left of a Web page, 
enabling you to create designs that begin flush with the edge of a browser.

9. Click the Apply button to see how the colors look on your page.
 
10. Click OK to finish and close the Page Properties dialog box. 
Changing Link Styles with Page Properties
If you’re like many designers, you probably don’t like the underline that auto-
matically appears under all the linked text in a Web page. In this section, you 
discover how easy it is to remove that underline and change the color, font 
face, and size for the links with Dreamweaver’s Page Properties dialog box. 
You can also change other page-wide settings, such as the background color 
and page margins, from the Page Properties dialog box.
The easiest way to alter all your link styles at once is to change them in the 
Page Properties dialog box. When you use this option, Dreamweaver creates 
the corresponding tag selector styles automatically and lists them in the CSS 
Styles panel. Other page-wide settings in this dialog box work similarly.
To change hyperlink and other styles with the Page Properties dialog box, 
open an existing page or create a new one and follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Page Properties button in the Property 
inspector. The Page Properties dialog box appears.
 
2. Select the Links (CSS) category on the left of the Page Properties 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
Figure 2-8: 
Use the 
Links (CSS) 
category in 
the Page 
Properties 
dialog box 
to change 
the style 
definitions 
for all four 
hyperlink 
states.
 

53
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
3. Specify a font face and size for your links.
 
 If you want to use the same font size and face for your links as you use in 
the rest of the text on your page, it’s best to leave these options blank; 
then, if you change the text settings for the page, you won’t have to 
remember to change them for your links as well.
 
4. Specify colors for each hyperlink state by clicking in the correspond-
ing color well and selecting a color from the Color dialog box.
 
 You can change any or all the link color settings. If you don’t specify a 
link color, the browser uses the default link color. Here’s an explanation 
of each of the four link states:
 
• Link Color: The color in which your links appear when the page 
is first loaded and the linked page hasn’t yet been visited by the 
browser. The corresponding HTML tag is <a:link>.
 
• Visited Links: The color your links change to after a browser has 
already viewed the linked page. The corresponding HTML tag is 
<a:visited>.
 
• Rollover Links: The color a link changes to as a user rolls a cursor 
over a link. The corresponding HTML tag is <a:hover>.
 
• Active Links: The color a link changes to as a user is actively click-
ing a link. The corresponding HTML tag is <a:active>.
 
5. Select a style from the Underline Style drop-down list.
 
 Many designers prefer to remove the underline that automatically 
appears under linked text by choosing Never Underline. I like to give 
visitors the visual cue of the underline, but only as they roll a cursor 
over a link, so I generally prefer the option labeled “Show underline only 
on rollover,” as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The Page Properties dialog box closes, the style settings are applied 
automatically to any links on the page, and the corresponding styles are 
added to the CSS Styles panel.
 
To fully test link styles, preview your page in a Web browser or click the Live 
View button at the top of the workspace. It’s good practice to test link settings 
in a browser when you make changes like the ones in the preceding exercise. 
Take a look at how your links appear; for example, do the active and visited 
link colors look good against the background color of the page. Remember that 
any styles you create using the Page Properties dialog box affect all links on 
your page unless you specifically apply a different style to an individual link 
that overrides the redefined tag style. If you want to use different link styles in 
different parts of the same page, you can create compound styles to create dif-
ferent link styles (see Chapter 6 for instructions on creating compound styles).

Adding and Formatting Text
Many people are pleasantly surprised by how easily they can create a basic 
Web page with text and images in Dreamweaver. This section focuses on text, 
the next section on images. 
 
In this chapter, I use Dreamweaver’s HTML formatting options, including 
the heading and paragraph tags. I start with basic HTML tags to keep things 
simple at this stage and to introduce you to what many designers consider 
the basic building blocks of a good Web page. In Chapters 5 and 6, you find 
detailed instructions for using CSS to change the size, color, and font and 
other style options of text formatted in HTML. 
Adding text to a Web page
To add text to a page, you can simply click to insert your cursor at the 
top of a page and type. If you want to add text that you have somewhere 
else, such as file created in Microsoft Word, you can copy and paste it into 
Dreamweaver instead of retyping it. 
Dreamweaver offers many ways to maintain formatting when you copy and 
paste text from another program. This is especially important when you 
copy text from Microsoft Word because if you just paste text in as is, you risk 
including a lot of extra code that is unique to Microsoft Word and can cause 
problems in your Web page.
You can change the default for how Dreamweaver handles formatting when 
you choose Edit➪Paste by altering the Preferences in the Copy/Paste cat-
egory. You can also choose Edit➪Paste Special to display these options any 
time you paste new content. 
Here are your four main options for inserting text when you choose 
Edit➪Paste Special (and two ways to refine your choice):
 
✓ Text Only: Dreamweaver strips any formatting and inserts plain text.
 
✓ Text with Structure: Dreamweaver includes paragraphs, lists, tables, 
and other structural formatting options. (This choice is my favorite 
because it removes any code specific to a program like Word if you use 
the Clean Up Word Paragraph Spacing check box described a little later, 
while preserving basic formatting.)
 
✓ Text with Structure Plus Basic Formatting: Dreamweaver includes 
structural formatting as well as basic formatting, such as bold and italic.

55
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
✓ Text with Structure Plus Full Formatting: In addition to the previous 
options, Dreamweaver includes formatting created by style sheets in 
programs, such as Microsoft Word.
 
✓ Retain Line Breaks: Line breaks are preserved, even if you don’t keep other 
formatting options. This option is not available if you choose Text Only.
 
✓ Clean Up Word Paragraph Spacing: This option removes special for-
matting code that is unique to Microsoft Word, and is unnecessary (and 
not recommended) for text on the Web.
I cover many more text formatting options in Chapter 5 because formatting 
on the Web is best done with CSS and you need to understand the basics of 
CSS before you start using styles to format text. 
Formatting text with the heading tags
One of the best formatting options for headlines is the collection of head-
ing tags. In HTML, using heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, and so forth) to format 
text that serves as a title or headline offers many advantages. Heading tags 
are designed to be displayed in relative sizes, with <h1> the largest, <h2> 
smaller, <h3> smaller still, and so on through <h6>. So no matter what a Web 
page’s default text size is (and text sizes can vary due to browser settings 
and computer platform), any text formatted with an <h1> tag is always larger 
than text formatted with <h2>. (In Chapter 5, you find instructions for creat-
ing styles that can change the appearance of heading tags while still preserv-
ing these benefits.) 
 
Popular belief is that many search engines give priority to keywords in text 
formatted with an <h1> tag because the most important text on a page is gen-
erally included in the largest size headline.
To format text with a heading tag, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the text you want to format.
 
2. In the Property inspector, at the bottom of the workspace, make sure 
the HTML button on the left side of the inspector is selected.
 
3. Use the Format drop-down list to select a heading option (see 
Figure 2-9).
 
 When heading tags are applied, the text automatically changes to 
become big and bold in design view.

With HTML 
selected, 
the Property 
inspector 
provides 
easy access 
to com-
mon HTML

features, 
such as the

In general, I find the Property inspector the easiest way to apply basic for-
matting, but you can also find these HTML formatting options by choosing 
Format➪Paragraph Format and then selecting a heading option from the sub-
menu that appears..
Adding paragraphs and line breaks
When you create page designs for the Web, you must work within many 
limitations that may seem confusing at first. Web design and print design 
are fundamentally different, and that can make even seemingly simple tasks 
more complicated than you might expect. How you create paragraph and line 
breaks is a good example.
If you’re working in design view in Dreamweaver and press the Enter key 
(Windows) or the Return key (Mac), Dreamweaver inserts a paragraph tag, 
or <p>, in the code, which creates a line break followed by a blank line. If you 
want a line break without the extra blank line, hold down the Shift key while 
you press Enter (or Return) to tell Dreamweaver to insert the <br /> tag 
into the code, creating a single line break.
Best practice is to avoid using multiple paragraph or break tags to create 
extra space in a Web page (and not all browsers will maintain the blank space 
if you create it that way). If you want to add a lot of space between para-
graphs or other elements on a page, your best option is to use CSS, which I 
cover in Chapters 5 and 6.

57
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
If you’re working in code view and add space using the Enter or Return key, 
you add blank space within the code. Extra space in HTML code can be useful 
because extra space can make code easier to read, but it doesn’t affect the 
way a page displays in design view or in a Web browser.
Setting Links in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver is truly a dream when it comes to setting links. As you set 
links, remember that a link is essentially an address on the Internet (a URL or 
Universal Resource Locator) that tells a viewer’s browser what page to open 
and where it is located when a viewer clicks the text or image containing the 
link.
To link to a page within your Web site, you can create a relative link that 
includes a path describing how to get from the current page to the linked 
page within your local site folder. A relative link doesn’t need to include the 
domain name of your site, just instructions for a browser to get from one 
page within your site to another. 
Linking to a page on another Web site — called an external link — is even 
easier than linking to an internal link. All you need is the URL of the page to 
which you want to link, and you’re most of the way there.
In the following sections, you find step-by-step instructions for creating inter-
nal and external links, as well as e-mail links, and jump links, which make it 
possible to link to a specific part of a Web page.
Linking pages within your Web site
Linking from one page to another page in your Web site is easy. Just make 
sure to save your pages in your local site folder (as described in the “Setting 
Up a New or Existing Site” section, at the beginning of this chapter) before 
you start setting links. 
Here’s how you create a link from one page in a Web site to another:
 
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page where you want to create a link.
 
2. Select the text or image that you want to serve as the link (meaning 
the text or image that a user clicks to trigger the link).
 
 Click and drag to highlight a section of text or click once to select an 
image. In this example, I selected the text how we grow trees and I 
linked it to a page named how-we-grow-trees.html located in the 
same folder.

58
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 
3. Click the Hyperlink icon in the Common Insert panel, at the top right 
of the workspace, shown in Figure 2-10.
 
 
 Alternatively, you can set a link by clicking the Browse button (which 
looks like a file folder) just to the right of the Link field in the Property 
inspector. Or see the Remember icon later in this section for a great 
shortcut using the Point to File icon.
 
 
4. In the Hyperlink dialog box (see Figure 2-11), click the Browse icon to 
the right of the Link drop-down list.
 
 The Select File dialog box opens.

link settings 
not avail-
able from 
the Property 
inspector, 
including 
Target 
options and 
accessibility 
settings.
 

59
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
5. (Optional) Use the Target field in the Hyperlink dialog box to set 
where your linked page opens. 
 
 For example, the _blank option causes the linked page to open in a new 
browser window or in a new tab within a browser, depending on the 
user’s browser settings. 
 
6. Click the filename to select the page that you want your image or text 
to link to, and then click OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac).
 
 When you click OK, the link is set automatically, and the dialog box 
closes. Note that to test your links, you have to view your page in a 
browser, a process I cover in Chapter 4.
 
After you become used to setting links, here’s a great shortcut: 
 
1. Click the Point to File icon in the Property inspector. 
 
 It looks like a circle with a dot in the middle and is located just to the left 
of the folder icon.
 
2. Drag your cursor across the page (without taking your finger of the right 
mouse button) and rest it on the name of any file in the Files panel. 
 
 When you click and drag from the File icon to a filename in this way, 
Dreamweaver extends a line to help you visualize that you’re setting the 
link properly. 
 
 The file must be visible in the Files panel, thus you may need to open a 
subfolder to reveal the file before you can set a link this way.
Setting links to named anchors in a page
Setting links to named anchors makes it possible to link to a specific place 
within a Web page. These kinds of links are generally used only on really long 
pages. A named anchor link is an HTML tag that can be inserted anywhere on 
a page to mark a specific point on the page with a name. The name can then 
serve as a target for a link. You can use a named anchor to link from an image 
or a section of text in one part of a page to another place on the same page, 
or to link from one page to a specific part of a different page. As you see in the 
following steps, to create an anchor link, sometimes called a jump link, you 
first insert a named anchor in the place you want to link to, and then add that 
anchor to the link code to direct the browser to that specific part of the page.
Suppose that you want to set a link from the word Tigers at the top of a 
page to a section lower on the page that starts with the headline Lions are 
Cooler than Tigers. First insert a named anchor at the Lions are Cooler than 
Tigers headline and then link the word Tigers from the top of the page to that 
anchor.

60
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To insert a named anchor and set a link to it, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page on which you want to insert the named anchor.
 
2. Place your cursor next to the word or image that you want to link to 
on the page.
 
 You don’t need to select the word or image; you just need a reference 
point that appears when the link is selected. For this example, I placed 
the cursor to the left of the product listing for White Spruce.
 
3. Choose Insert➪Named Anchor.
 
 The Insert Named Anchor dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter a name for the anchor.
 
 You can name anchors anything you want (as long as you don’t use 
spaces or special characters). Just make sure that you use a different 
name for each anchor on the same page. Then be sure that you remember 
the anchor’s name because you have to either type it to set the link or 
Creating multiple pages to set links
Creating a new page to start a Web site may 
seem obvious but consider this: Before you get 
too far in your development, you may want to 
create a few new pages and start organizing 
the new pages in subdirectories before you 
add anything to them. Doing so enables you 
to organize the structure of your site before 
you start setting links. After all, you can’t use 
Dreamweaver’s link features to link to a page 
that doesn’t exist. If you plan to have three links 
on your front page that link to the three main 
sections of your site, go ahead and create those 
three main pages, even if you don’t put anything 
but a little text on each page as you create it. 
(Of course, you can always change those pages 
later and add more pages to each section, but 
setting up the main links to the main sections is 
a great way to start designing your site.)
For example, say you’re creating a site for 
your small business. You likely want a few 
main pages, such as a page about your 
staff, another page about your products or 
services, and a third page with general 
information and resources. At this initial stage, 
you could create four pages — one for the front 
page of the site and one for each subsection. 
Name the front page index.html and the 
other pages staff.html, about.html, and 
general.html. 
If you expect to create many related pages in 
each section, consider creating subfolders for 
each, with a main page in the subfolder. For 
example, you could create a main index.
html page inside a services subfolder and 
another index.html page inside a staff 
subfolder. Remember, naming the main page 
within a subfolder index.html enables you 
to use addresses to subpages that include the 
folder name, such as www.domain.com/
services. Your site can include as many 
index.html pages as you like, as long as 
each is in a separate subfolder.
 As you start creating your site, setting up all 
these main section pages helps you to organize 
your site and makes setting up the main links on 
all the site pages easier. 

61
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
select its name from the drop-down list in the Hyperlink dialog box, as you 
see in Step 8. In this example, I chose wspruce as the anchor name.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and a small anchor icon appears on the page 
where you inserted the anchor name. You can move an anchor name by 
clicking the anchor icon and dragging it to another location on the page.
 
 If you’re curious about what this named anchor looks like in HTML, 
here’s the code that appears before the headline in my example:
<a name=”wspruce” id=”white-spruce”></a>
 
 Remember that Dreamweaver creates XHTML code, which is a strict ver-
sion of HTML and requires that all code be in lowercase letters.
 
6. To set a link to the named anchor location, select the text or image 
that you want to link from.
 
 You can link to a named anchor from anywhere else on the same page or 
from another page. In my example, I linked from the words White Spruce 
at the top of the page to the anchor I made next to the product listing for 
that type of tree.
 
 
7. Click the Link icon in the Common Insert panel, at the top right of the 
workspace.
 
 
8. In the Hyperlink dialog box, use the small arrow to the right of the 
Link box to select the anchor.
 
 Alternatively, using the Property inspector, you can set a jump link by 
typing a pound sign (#) followed by the anchor name.
 
 
 You can also select the text and drag a line from the Point to File icon 
(next to the Link text box) to the anchor icon. The anchor name auto-
matically appears in the Link box, saving you from typing the name.
 
 In my example, I typed #wspruce in the Link text box. The HTML code 
for this line looks like this:
<a href=”#wspruce”>White Spruce</a>
 
 If you want to link to an anchor named wspruce on another page with the 
filename trees-for-sale.html, type trees-for-sale.html#wspruce in 
the Link text box.
Linking to another Web site
To link to a page on another Web site — sometimes called an external link — 
all you need is the URL of the page to which you want to link, and you’re most 
of the way there.

62
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To create an external link, follow these steps:
 
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page where you want to create the link.
 
2. Select the text or image that you want to act as the link.
 
3. In the Link text box in the Property inspector, type the URL of the 
page you want your text or image to link to.
 
 The link is set automatically. In the example in Figure 2-12, I created a 
link using the text RootMaker® System to link to a Web site about this 
special way of growing trees, which is at the URL www.rootmaker.org.
 
Figure 2-12: 
To set a link 
to another 
Web site, 
highlight 
the text or 
image you 
want to link 
and type 
the URL in 
the Link 
text box.
 
 
Although, you don’t have to type the http:// or even the www. at the begin-
ning of a Web site address to get to a site in most Web browsers, you must 
always use the full URL, including the http://, when you create a link to 
another Web site in HTML. Otherwise, the browser can’t find the correct 
external site address, and the visitor will probably end up on an error page.
Setting a link to an e-mail address
Another common link option goes to an e-mail address. Visitors can send you 
messages easily with e-mail links. I always recommend that you invite visitors 
to contact you because including contact information helps establish cred-
ibility on the Web and because visitors to your site can point out mistakes 

63
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
and give you valuable feedback about how you can improve your site. Setting 
a link to an e-mail address is just as easy as setting a link to another Web 
page. All you need to know is the e-mail address you want to link to and what 
text or image you want to use when you set the link.
 
 To create an e-mail link, select the text you want to link and then click the 
E-mail Link icon in the Common Insert panel. In the E-mail Link dialog box, 
enter the e-mail address in the Link field and then click OK. If you want to use 
an image as an e-mail link, select an image in Dreamweaver’s main work area, 
then click the Hyperlink icon in the Common insert panel, and type the e-mail 
link into the Link field.
You can also set e-mail links using the Link field in the Property inspector, 
but you must enter the code mailto: (no //) before the e-mail address, as 
shown in Figure 2-13. For example, if you typed a link to my e-mail address 
into the Property inspector, you’d need to type mailto:janine@jcwarner.com. 
Here’s what the full line of code behind that e-mail link would look like:
<a href=”mailto:janine@jcwarner.com”>Send a message to 
Janine</a>
 
Figure 2-13: 
Create an 
e-mail link in 
the Property 
inspector.
 
 
When visitors to your Web site click an e-mail link, their computer systems 
automatically launch their e-mail program and create a blank e-mail message 
to the specified e-mail address. Although this trick is cool, your users may find 
an e-mail’s sudden appearance disconcerting if they don’t expect it to happen, 
and the e-mail link won’t work if your users don’t have e-mail programs on 
their computers. That’s why I always try to let users know when I use an 
e-mail link. For example, instead of just linking the words Contact Janine, I link 
the words E-mail Janine. Even better, I often link the actual e-mail address.
 
When you create an e-mail link on a Web page that will be displayed on the 
public Internet, you open yourself to spammers, some of whom use automated 
programs to “lift” e-mail addresses off Web pages. Spam is the reason many 
sites don’t include e-mail links, but instead use one of the following methods 
to provide visitors with contact info:

64
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
✓ Text worded for people (not bots): An example is Send e-mail to Janine 
at jcwarner.com. Using text to describe the e-mail address instead of 
including the actual address can help thwart spammers, but it does 
make it a little harder for your visitors to send you e-mail.
 
✓ Code that hides your e-mail address from bots: The online service 
AddressMunger, which makes it easy for you to create special code 
using JavaScript to hide your e-mail address from spammers. Visit www.
AddressMunger.com to read more about this free service. 
 
✓ Forms: By setting up a form with a script that delivers the form’s contents 
to an e-mail address, you can also require visitors to your site to include 
more information, such as why they are sending you an e-mail message. 
Using a form requires that you set up a script on your Web server, which 
can get complicated. You read more about form mail scripts and how to 
create the HTML code needed for forms in Chapter 11.
Understanding the HTML behind links
You don’t have to learn HTML code to use Dreamweaver, but the ability to 
recognize important snippets of code behind your pages is often helpful. 
Because links are so important to Web pages and the Internet as whole, I 
include this final section to help you understand the code behind your links.
Here’s an example of what the code looks like for a relative link from 
the home page on my Web site at www.DigitalFamily.com to the 
Dreamweaver page in the books section, which is contained within a folder 
named books. Note that essentially, you are telling the browser to enter the 
subfolder named books and find the page named dreamweaver.html:
<a href=”books/dreamweaver.html”>Dreamweaver Books</a>
<a href=”/books/dreamweaver.html”>Dreamweaver Books</a>
If you link to a page on a different Web site, the link includes the full Internet 
address of the other site. Here’s an example of what the code would look like 
if you created a link from your site to the Dreamweaver page in my books 
section:
<a href=”http://www.digitalfamily.com/books/
dreamweaver.html”>Janine’s Books on 
Dreamweaver</a>
If all that href code stuff looks like Greek to you, don’t worry. Remember 
Dreamweaver sets links like this for you so you don’t even have to look at 
this code if you don’t want to. (I include these final tips because I think it’s 
helpful to have a little understanding of what’s happening behind the scenes, 
not because you have to memorize any of this stuff or anything.)

 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
Adding Meta Tags for Search Engines
If you’ve heard of meta tags, you probably associate them with search 
engines, and you’d be right. Meta tags are used for a variety of things, but 
one of the most common uses is to provide special text that doesn’t appear 
on your page but is read by crawlers, bots, and other programs that scour 
the Web cataloging and ranking Web pages for Bing, Google, and a long list of 
other search-related sites.
In Dreamweaver you find features that help you add meta tags for keywords 
and descriptions. Here’s a brief explanation of each tag; the steps for filling 
each tag with text are coming up:
 
✓ Meta keyword tag: A meta keyword tag enables you to include a list of 
keywords you would like search engines to match if someone searches 
for those words. Unfortunately, meta keywords have been so abused by 
Web designers attempting to mislead visitors about the true content of 
their Web pages that most search engines ignore the meta keyword tag 
and its contents. That said, some search engines still recognize meta 
keywords, and using this meta tag won’t hurt your ranking with any 
search engines. Thus, most search engine experts consider it good prac-
tice to include them.
 
✓ Meta description tag: This tag, which is more widely used, is designed 
to let you include a written description of your Web site a worthwhile 
endeavor. Search engines often use the meta description tag’s contents 
as the brief description that appears in search results pages. If you don’t 
include your own text in a meta description tag, many search engines 
use the first several words that appear on your page as the descrip-
tion. Depending on your design, the first few words may not be the best 
description of your site, and you’ll be better served by including your 
own meta description in the code.
 
You can include the same meta description on every page of your site, but 
most search engine experts will tell you that the best strategy is to include a 
description that is specific to the contents of each page on your site.
Follow these steps to add a meta description tag to your page:
 
1. Open the page where you want to add a meta description.
 
 You can use meta descriptions on any or all pages on your Web site. 
(Many people using search engines to find your site may end up directly 
at internal pages if the content matches the search.)
 
2. Choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪Description, as shown in 
Figure 2-14.
 
 The Description dialog box appears.

66
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
Figure 2-14: 
Many 
search 
engines

entered into 
the meta 
description 
field as the 
descrip-
tion of your 
Web page 
in search 
results.
 
 
3. In the Description text box, enter the text you want for your page 
description.
 
 Don’t add any HTML to the text in this box.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The description text you entered is inserted into the Head area at the 
top of the page in the HTML code. Meta content doesn’t appear in the 
body of the page.
If you want to add keywords, repeat Steps 1–4, choosing Insert➪HTML➪Head 
Tags➪Keywords in Step 2. Type a list of keywords, separated by commas, in 
place of a description in Step 3.
Using the Quick Tag Editor
If you’re one of those developers who likes to work in the Dreamweaver 
Design area — sometimes referred to as the WYSIWYG (what you see is what 
you get) editing environment — but still wants to look at the HTML tags once 
in a while, you’ll love the Quick Tag Editor.
The Quick Tag Editor, as the name implies, lets you quickly access HTML tags 
and enables you to modify, add, or remove an HTML tag without opening the 

67
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
HTML Source window. So while you’re in the middle of working on a page in 
design view, you can view the HTML tag you’re working on without switching 
over to code view. You can use the Quick Tag Editor to insert HTML, edit an 
existing tag, or wrap new tags around a selected text block or other element.
The Quick Tag Editor opens in one of three modes — Edit, Insert, or Wrap — 
depending on what you selected on the page before you launched the editor. 
Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Mac) to change modes 
while the Quick Tag Editor is open.
You can enter or edit tags in the Quick Tag Editor just as you would in code 
view, without having to switch back and forth between code view and design 
view. To enter or edit tags in the Quick Tag Editor, follow these steps:
 
1. With the document you want to edit open, select an image, text block, 
or other element.
 
 If you want to add new code, simply click anywhere in the file without 
selecting text or an element.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Quick Tag Editor.
 
 You can also press Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Mac). Or, you can right-
click the name of the element tag in the status bar at the bottom of the 
workspace.
 
 The Quick Tag Editor opens in the mode that is most appropriate for 
your selection, as shown in Figure 2-15. For example, if you click an 
image or formatted text, it displays the current tag so that you can edit 
it. If you don’t select anything or if you select unformatted text, the 
Quick Tag Editor opens with nothing in it, and you can enter the code 
you want to add.

You can 
view and 
edit HTML 
tags in 
the Quick 
Tag Editor

3. To add a new tag or attribute, simply type the code into the Quick Tag 
Editor.
 
 If you aren’t sure about a tag or attribute, press the spacebar, and 
the Hints drop-down list appears automatically, displaying all the 
tags or attributes available for the element you’re editing. If this Hints 
drop-down list doesn’t appear, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Code Hints 
(Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Code Hints (Mac) and make 
sure that the Enable Code Hints option is selected.
 
4. To close the Quick Tag Editor and apply all your changes, press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac).

N
o matter how great the writing on your Web site may be, the graph-
ics always get people’s attention first. The key to making a good first 
impression is to use images that look great and download quickly.
If you’re familiar with using a graphics-editing program, such as Adobe 
Photoshop or Fireworks, to create graphics for the Web, you’re a step ahead. 
If not, you find pointers throughout this chapter on how to convert images 
for the Web, what image formats to use, and how to optimize images for 
faster download times. I use Adobe Photoshop CS5 in the examples in this 
chapter, but because the features I use in this chapter are nearly identical in 
both programs, you can use these same instructions to complete these tasks 
in Photoshop Elements. (See the sidebar “Comparing Adobe Web graphics 
programs” to learn more about the differences.)
If your images are already in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format and ready for the 
Web, you can jump ahead to the “Inserting Images in Dreamweaver” section, 
where you find out how to place and align images and use an image as a 
background. You also discover some of Dreamweaver’s built-in image-editing 
features, which enable you to crop images and even adjust contrast and 
brightness without ever launching an external image-editing program.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Creating and Optimizing Web Graphics
The most important thing to keep in mind when creating images for the Web 
is that you want to optimize your images to make your file sizes as small as 
possible so that they download as quickly as possible.
Comparing Adobe Web graphics programs
Most professional designers strongly prefer 
Adobe Photoshop, although I have to say I’ve 
been impressed with Photoshop Elements, 
which is a “light” version but offers many of 
the same features for a fraction of the cost. The 
following is a list of some of the most popular 
image-editing programs on the market today. 
All these image programs are available for both 
Mac and Windows:
 ✓ Adobe Photoshop (www.adobe.com/
photoshop): By far the most popular 
image-editing program on the market, 
Photoshop is a widely used standard among 
graphics professionals. With Photoshop, 
you can create original artwork, edit and 
enhance photographs, and so much more. 
Photoshop has a wealth of powerful paint-
ing and selection tools, special effects, and 
filters that enable you to create images 
far beyond what you can capture on film 
or create with many other illustration pro-
grams. In previous versions, Photoshop 
came bundled with a program called Image 
Ready, a companion program designed 
for Web graphics. In CS3, those Web fea-
tures were included in Photoshop; and in 
CS4, they’ve been enhanced. Switching 
between Photoshop and Dreamweaver is 
easier than ever.
 ✓ Adobe Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.
com/elements): If you don’t need all the 
bells and whistles offered in the full-blown 
version of Photoshop, Photoshop Elements is 
a remarkably powerful program — for about 
a sixth of the price. If you’re a professional 
designer, you’re best served by Photoshop. 
But if you’re a hobbyist or small business 
owner and want to create good-looking 
images without the high cost and learning 
curve of a professional graphics program, 
Elements is a great deal and well-suited to 
creating Web graphics.
 ✓ Adobe Fireworks (www.adobe.com/
fireworks): Fireworks was one of the 
first image-editing programs designed to 
create and edit Web graphics. Originally 
created by Macromedia, the program is 
now part of the Adobe Web Suite and is fully 
integrated with Dreamweaver. Fireworks 
gives you everything you need to create, 
edit, and output Web graphics, all in one 
well-designed product. Although Fireworks 
lacks many of the advanced image-editing 
capabilities of Photoshop, Fireworks shines 
when creating Web graphics and is espe-
cially popular among Web designers who 
rave about the ability to create a design in 
Fireworks that can easily be sliced and con-
verted into a Web page in Dreamweaver.
If you have an Internet connection and want to 
do basic image editing for free, visit http://
www.gimp.org or www.photoshop.
com/express. Both sites make it possible 
to edit and optimize images online without pur-
chasing a software program.

71
 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
 
How you optimize an image depends on how the image was created and 
whether you want to save it as a JPEG, PNG or, GIF. You find instructions for 
optimizing images with Photoshop in the sections that follow, but the bottom 
line is this: No matter what program, format, or optimization technique you 
choose, your biggest challenge is finding the best balance between small file 
size and good image quality. Essentially, the more you optimize, the faster the 
image will download, but the compression and color reduction techniques 
used to optimize images can make them look terrible if you go too far.
As a general rule, do any editing, such as adjusting contrast, retouching, or 
combining images before you reduce their size or optimize them because you 
want to work with the highest resolution possible when you’re editing. Also, 
resize an image before you optimize it. You find instructions for resizing an 
image in the next exercise and instructions for optimizing in the sections that 
follow.
Resizing graphics and photos
Resizing is important for two reasons: The images must be small enough to 
display well on a computer monitor, and you want them to download quickly 
to a user’s computer. The smaller the image is, the faster it will download.
 
Although you can change the display size of an image in a Web page by 
altering the height and width settings in Dreamweaver, you get much better 
results if you change the physical size of the image in editor program such as 
Photoshop, instead.
 
When you alter an image’s height and width in the HTML code (via the height 
and width settings in Dreamweaver), you simply instruct a Web browser to 
display the image in a different size. Unfortunately, browsers don’t do a good 
job of resizing images because browsers don’t change the image itself, but just 
force it to fit in the assigned space when the browser loads the page. If you 
set the image to display larger than its actual size, the image is likely to look 
fuzzy or distorted because the image doesn’t contain enough pixels for all the 
details to look good in a larger size. If you set the code to display the image 
smaller than it is, the image is likely to look squished, and you’re requiring 
that your users download an image that’s larger than necessary.
Reducing an image’s size for use on the Web requires two steps. First, you 
reduce the resolution of an image, which changes the number of pixels in the 
image. When you’re working with images for the Web, you want to reduce the 
resolution to 72 pixels per inch (or ppi). (If you’re wondering why 72, see the 
sidebar that’s appropriately named “Why only 72 ppi?”) Second, you reduce 
the image’s physical size by reducing its dimensions. You want to size your 
images to fit well in a browser window and to work within the design of 
your site.

72
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Follow these steps to lower the resolution and reduce the size of an image in 
Photoshop (in Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, you follow a similar pro-
cess although the specific steps may vary):
 
1. With an image open in Photoshop, choose Image➪Resize.
 
 The Image Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figures 3-1 and 3-2.
 
 If you don’t want your original image to lose quality (or you just want 
to play it safe), make a copy of your image and resize the copy for your 
Web site.
 
2. To change the resolution of your image, first deselect the Resample 
Image check box at the bottom of the Image Size dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 3-1.
 
 For best results, you always want the Resample Image check box dese-
lected when you change the resolution.
 
3. Click and drag to highlight the number in the Resolution field and 
replace it by typing in the number 72.
 
Figure 3-1: 
To best 
prepare 
your images 
for the Web, 
change the 
resolution to 
72 ppi and 
they will 
download 
faster.
 
 
4. Click to select the Resample Image check box.
 
 With the Resample Image check box deselected, you can’t change the 
Pixel dimensions so it must be checked when you change the image size.
 
5. Enter a height and width for the image in the Height and Width fields.
 
 As shown in Figure 3-2, I’m reducing the size of this image to 200 pixels 
wide. If the Constrain Proportions check box at the bottom of the dialog 
box is checked (as it is in this example), any changes you make to the 

73
 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
height automatically affect the width (and vice versa) to ensure that the 
image proportions remain constant. I prefer to work this way, but if you 
do want to change the image and not maintain the proportions, you can 
deselect this box.
 
Figure 3-2: 
When you 
resize an 
image in 
Photoshop 
in the Pixel 
Dimensions 
area, you 
can specify 
the new size 
in pixels or 
as a per-
centage of 
the original 
size.
 
 
6. Click OK to resize the image.
 
 If you want to return the image to its previous size, choose Edit➪Undo. 
Beware that when you save the image, the changes become permanent.
Why only 72 ppi?
When you save images for the Web, you save 
them at a resolution of 72 pixels per inch (better 
known as ppi). Most computer monitors display 
no more than 72 ppi, so any resolution higher 
than that is wasted on the Web because you’d 
be making your visitors download more pixels 
than they can see. However, if you want to print 
an image, you want all the pixels you can get, 
usually at least 200 ppi or higher, which is why 
most images you see on the Web look terrible if 
you try to print them in a large size.

74
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Choosing the best image format
One of the most common questions about images for the Web concerns 
when to use GIF or PNG and when to use JPEG. Table 3-1 provides the simple 
answer.
Table 3-1 
Image Formats for the Web
Format
Best Use
GIF
(Extension 
is .gif)
For line art (such as one- or two-color logos), simple drawings, ani-
mations, and basically any image that has no gradients or blends. 
GIF is also the best format when you want to display an image with 
a transparent background.
PNG
(Extension 
is .png)
PNG generally produces better-looking images with smaller file 
sizes than GIF for the same kinds of limited-color images. Really old 
browsers, such as IE 3, don’t support the PNG format, but most Web 
designers now choose this format over GIF because so few people 
use such old browsers. Browsers as recent as IE6 don’t display 
transparent PNG files properly, which is unfortunate because PNG 
files tend to handle transparency better. If you’re using transpar-
ency and know that many of the visitors to your site still use IE6 or 
earlier versions, you may want to consider using GIFs instead. 
JPEG
(Extension 
may be 
.jpg or 
.jpeg)
JPEG is the best format for colorful, complex images (such as pho-
tographs); images containing gradients or color blends; and any 
other images with millions of colors.
Saving images for the Web: The basics
If you’re new to saving images for the Web, the following basics can help you 
get the best results from your files, your image-editing program, and ulti-
mately your Web pages. You can
 
✓ Convert an image from any format into the GIF, PNG, or JPEG for-
mats. For example, turn all your TIF, BMP, and PSD image files into a 
Web-friendly file format.
 
✓ Optimize images that are already in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format. Even if 
your files are already in a Web-friendly format, following the instructions 
in this chapter to optimize images with Adobe’s Save for Web dialog box 
further reduces their file sizes for faster download over the Internet.

75
 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
 
✓ Use many programs to create Web graphics, but Photoshop is one 
of the best and easiest to use. Under the File menu in Photoshop (and 
Photoshop Elements), you’ll find the Save for Web option. (In Photoshop 
CS4 and CS5, the option is Save for Web & Devices.) Fireworks provides 
a similar feature, and although the dialog boxes are slightly different in 
each program, the basic options for compressing and reducing colors 
(which are covered in this chapter) are the same.
 
 See the upcoming sections “Optimizing JPEG images for the Web” and 
“Optimizing images in GIF and PNG formats” for details about using the 
Save for Web feature.
 
✓ Make image edits before you optimize. When you’re editing, using 
the highest quality image possible is always best. Make sure to do all 
your editing, sharpening, and resizing before you use the Save for Web 
option. Similarly, if you want to make further changes to an image after 
you’ve optimized it, you’ll achieve the best results if you go back a 
higher resolution version of the image rather than editing the version 
that’s been optimized for the Web. (When you use the Save for Web & 
Devices feature, Photoshop creates a new copy of your image and leaves 
the original unchanged.)
Optimizing JPEG images for the Web
The JPEG format is the best choice for optimizing continuous-tone images, 
such as photographs and images with many colors or gradients. When you 
optimize a JPEG, you can make the file size smaller by applying compression. 
The more compression, the smaller the image, but if you compress the image 
too much, the image can look terrible. The trick is finding the right balance, 
as you discover in this section.
If you have a digital photograph or another image that you want to prepare 
for the Web, follow these steps to optimize and save it in Photoshop (in 
Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, the process is similar although the spe-
cific steps may vary):
 
1. With the image open in Photoshop, choose File➪Save for Web & 
Devices (or File➪Save for Web).
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. In the top-left corner of the dialog box, choose either 2-Up or 4-Up to 
display multiple versions of the same image for easy side-by-side 
comparison.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 3-3, I chose 2-Up, which makes it possible 
to view the original image on the left and a preview of the same image as 
it will appear with the specified settings on the right. The 4-Up option, as 
the name implies, displays four different versions for comparison.

76
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
Figure 3-3: 
The JPEG 
format is 
best for 
photographs 
and other 
images with 
millions of 
colors.
 
 
3. On the right side of the window, just under Preset, click the small 
arrow to open the Optimized File Format drop-down list and choose 
JPEG (this dialog window is open in Figure 3-3).
 
4. Set the compression quality.
 
 Use the preset options Low, Medium, High, Very High, or Maximum from 
the drop-down list. Or use the slider just under the Quality field to make 
more precise adjustments. Lowering the quality reduces the file size and 
makes the image download more quickly, but if you lower this number 
too much, the image will look blurry and blotchy.
 
 Photoshop uses a compression scale of 0 to 100 for JPEGs in this dialog 
window, with 0 the lowest possible quality (the highest amount of com-
pression and the smallest file size) and 100 the highest possible quality 
(the least amount of compression and the biggest file size). Low, Medium, 
and High represent compression values of 10, 30, and 60, respectively.
 
5. Specify other settings as desired (the compression quality and file 
format are the most important settings).
 
6. Click Save.
 
 The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
 
7. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder in your 
Web site folder.

77
 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
 
 Photoshop saves the optimized image as a copy of the original and 
leaves the original open in the main Photoshop work area. (Chapter 2 
explains the importance of the images subfolder.)
Repeat these steps for each image you want to optimize as a JPEG.
 
At the bottom of the image preview in the Save for Web and Devices dialog 
box, Photoshop includes an estimate of the time required for the image to 
download at the specified connection speed. In the example shown in Figure 
3-3, the estimate is 7 seconds at 56.6 Kbps. As you adjust the compression 
settings, the size of the image changes and the download estimate will auto-
matically adjust. You can change the connection speed used to make this 
calculation by clicking on the small arrow just to the right of the connection 
speed and using the drop-down list to select another option, such as 256 Kbps 
for Cable Modem speed. Use this estimate as a guide to help you decide how 
much you should optimize each image.
Optimizing images in GIF and PNG formats
If you’re working with a graphic, such as a logo, cartoon character, or draw-
ing that can be displayed in 256 colors or less, your best bet is to use the 
PNG format and reduce the total number of colors used in the image as much 
as possible to reduce the file size. (If you are concerned about visitors using 
a very, very old Web browser, use GIF instead.)
To help make up for the degradation in image quality that can happen when 
colors are removed, GIF and PNG use a dithering trick. Dithering involves 
alternating pixels in a checkerboard-like pattern to create subtle color varia-
tions, even with a limited color palette. The effect can smooth the image’s 
edges and make it appear to have more colors than it actually does.
To convert an image to a GIF or PNG in Photoshop, follow these steps (in 
Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, the process is similar although the spe-
cific steps may vary):
 
1. With the image open in Photoshop, choose File➪Save for Web & 
Devices (or File➪Save for Web).
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. In the top-left corner of the dialog box, choose 2-Up or 4-Up to display 
multiple versions of the same image for easy side-by-side comparison.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 3-4, I chose 4-Up, which makes it possi-
ble to view the original image (in the upper-left corner), as well as three 
different previews of the same image.
 
3. Select a preview image to begin changing its settings.

78
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 Changing the preview images in the 4-Up view enables you to compare 
an image with up to four different color settings, as you see in Figure 3-4.
 
4. On the right side of the dialog window, just under Preset, click the 
small arrow to open the Optimized File Format drop-down list and 
choose either GIF or PNG.
 
5. In the Colors box, select the number of colors, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
 The fewer colors you use, the smaller the file size and the faster the 
image will download. But be careful; if you reduce the colors too much 
(as I have in the bottom-right preview shown in Figure 3-4), you lose 
details. The ideal number of colors depends on your image; if you go too 
far, your image will look terrible.
 
6. If you want to maintain a transparent area in your image, select the 
Transparency check box.
 
 Any area of the image that was transparent when you created the image 
in the editor appears transparent in the preview window. If you don’t 
have a transparent area in your image, this setting has no effect.
 
 Transparency is a good trick for making text or an image appear to 
float on a Web page. That’s because a transparent background doesn’t 
appear on the Web page. You can select transparency as a background 
option in the New File dialog box when you create a new image in 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.
 
7. If you choose Transparency, also specify a Matte color.
 
 You want the matte color to match the background of your Web page 
so that the dithering along the transparent edge will blend in with the 
background. If you don’t specify a matte color, the transparency is set 
for a white background, which can cause a halo effect when the image is

8. Specify other settings as desired.
 
 The remainder of the settings in this dialog box can be left at their 
defaults in Photoshop.
 
9. Click Save.
 
 The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
 
10. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder (or any 
other folder) in your local site folder.
Repeat these steps for each image you want to optimize as a GIF or PNG for 
your site.
 
Trial and error is a great technique in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box. 
In each of the three preview windows displaying optimized versions of the 
cool cartoon image in Figure 3-4, I used fewer and fewer colors, which reduced 
the file size with increasingly degrading effect.

The version in the top left of the dialog box is the original, which has a file 
size of 92.6K. Reducing the image to 256 colors dramatically reduced the file 
size to 12.24K, but made little noticeable change to the image, as you see 
in the top right. In the bottom left, the image is reduced to 64 colors, which 
brought the size down to 7.959K, but still made little change to the quality of 
the image. In the bottom right, I reduced it to 2 colors, and the image qual-
ity suffered dramatically. Although it’s harder to tell in the black-and-white 
reproduction in this book, all the color and details disappeared, leaving just 
a black-and-white outline. In this last case, the small savings in file size are 
clearly not worth the loss of image quality.
How small is small enough?
After you know how to optimize GIFs and JPEGs and appreciate the goal of 
making them as small as possible, you may ask, “How small is small enough?” 
The answer is mostly subjective, but the following points are good to remember:
 
✓ The larger your graphics files, the longer people have to wait for them 
to download before they can see them. You may have the most beautiful 
picture of Mount Fuji on the front page of your Web site, but if it takes for-
ever to download, most people aren’t patient enough to wait to see it.

80
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
✓ When you build pages with multiple graphics, you have to consider 
the cumulative download time of all the graphics on the page. Even if 
each individual image is a small file size, they can add up. Unlike most 
things in life, smaller is definitely better on the Web.
 
✓ Most Web pros consider anything from about 75K to 150K a good 
maximum cumulative size for all the elements on a given page. With 
the increasing popularity of DSL and cable modems, many Web sites are 
starting to become a bit more graphics heavy and go beyond that size 
limit. However, anything over 150K is pushing the limit, especially if you 
expect people with dialup modems (56K and under) or those surfing on 
mobile phones to stick around long enough to view your pages.
 
To make determining the total file size of the images on your page easy, 
Dreamweaver includes this information in the status bar at the bottom 
of the Document window, as shown in Figure 3-5. In the small text at the 
bottom of this Web page about Fallow Deer, the status bar shows that 
the total size of all the images, text, and code on the page adds up to 
149K and will download in 10 seconds at the connection at the speed 
specified in Dreamweaver’s preferences. In this example, the connec-
tion speed is set to 128K. (You can change connection speed by choos-
ing Edit➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed. On a Mac, choose 
Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed.)

 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
Inserting Images in Dreamweaver
Now for the fun part. Adding an image to your Web page may seem almost 
magical at first because it’s so simple with Dreamweaver. The challenge with 
Web graphics isn’t adding them to your pages but creating good-looking 
images that load quickly in your viewer’s browser. You need another pro-
gram, such as Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, or Fireworks, to create, 
convert, edit, and optimize images (covered in Chapter 3). Optimizing images 
makes file sizes smaller so your images download faster. Dreamweaver pro-
vides some basic image-editing tools, but mostly you use Dreamweaver to 
insert and position images on your page.
Dreamweaver makes placing images on your Web pages easy and provides 
multiple ways to do so:
 
✓ Click the Images icon in the Common Insert panel and then select an 
image using the Insert image dialog box
 
✓ In the Files panel, click and drag an image name onto the page where 
you want the image to appear.
 
✓ Use the Insert menu, as I explain the following steps.
 
If you don’t have a Web-optimized JPEG, GIF, or PNG image handy, you can 
download free images that are already optimized from my Web site by going 
directly to www.DigitalFamily.com/free. (You find instructions for 
downloading the free images when you get to this special page on my 
Web site.)
To place an image on a Web page using the Insert menu, follow these 
instructions:
 
1. Open an existing page or choose File➪New to create a new page.
 
2. Place your cursor where you want to insert the image on the page.
 
 
3. Choose Insert➪Image.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
4. Browse to locate the image you want to insert.
 
 Depending on your computer system, you can preview images as you 
insert them in different ways. Here are three common options:
 
• On a PC with Windows XP, choose Thumbnails from the View drop-
down list to the right of the Look In field to display thumbnail ver-
sions of all the images in any open folder. You can also view a single 
preview of any selected image in the far right of the dialog box.

82
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
• On a PC with Windows Vista or Windows 7 (as shown in Figure 
3-6), choose one of the icon options (small, medium, large, or extra 
large) from the View drop-down list just to the right of the Look In 
field to display thumbnail versions of all the images in any open 
folder. You can also view a single preview of any selected image in 
the far right of the dialog box.
 
• On a Mac, choose the View As Columns option from the top left of 
the dialog, and you can view a single preview of any selected image 
in the far right of the dialog.
 
5. To insert the image, double-click the image name or click once and 
then click OK.
 
 If you have Accessibility options turned on in Preferences (the default), 
the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears.
 
 If you insert an image into a page and the image isn’t saved in your local 
site folder, Dreamweaver prompts you with a warning dialog and offers 
to copy the image into your local site folder. (Find out how to set up 
a local site folder in the section “Setting Up a New or Existing Site,” in 
Chapter 2.) Many designers create a subfolder called images inside the 
local site folder where they store all the images in their site, but you can 
organize images in multiple subfolders if you prefer.

You can 
locate and 
preview the 
images in

Source dia-
log box.
 

83
 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
 
6. In the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, enter text that 
describes the image in the Alternate Text field.
 
 Adding alternate text in this dialog box is always a best practice.
 
 Alternate text won’t appear on your Web page unless the image isn’t vis-
ible, but it will appear in Internet Explorer when a user holds the cursor 
over the image. Alternate text is also important for Web surfers who 
use screen readers, or browsers that “read” Web pages to them, such 
as those with limited vision. For this reason, alternate text is required 
for accessibility compliance. A long description is considered optional 
under most accessibility guidelines. You can enter the address of a 
Web page with a longer description of the image in this field. You can 
also add or edit alternate text in the Property inspector after clicking to 
select the inserted image.
 
7. Click OK to close the Accessibility Attributes dialog box and insert the 
image.
 
 The image appears in the page.
 
8. Click to select the image on your Web page to view image properties.
 
 Image options are displayed automatically in the Property inspector at 
the bottom of the page when an image is selected, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
Figure 3-7: 
When an 
image is 
selected, 
the Property 
inspector

easy access

image attri-
butes, such 
as height

settings.
 

84
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
Although you can change many settings, such as image alignment, by using 
the HTML attribute options available in the Property inspector, using CSS 
(covered in Chapter 5) is almost always a better option. For example, you can 
use the H Space attribute in the Property inspector to create a margin around 
an image, but H Space adds margin on both the left and right sides of an 
image. With CSS, you can create a style that applies margin space to any or all 
sides of an image, giving you more control of your design.
Table 3-2 describes the many image attributes available in the Property 
inspector when an image is selected. If you don’t see all the attributes listed 
in the table on your screen, click the small triangle in the bottom-right corner 
of the Property inspector to reveal all the image options.
 
When you insert an image file onto a page, you don’t actually add a copy of the 
image to the page; you create a reference to the image. The underlying code 
looks much like the code for a link from one page to another. Both image refer-
ences and links include the name of the file (the page you link to or the image 
you insert) and the path from the page to that file. Essentially, you’re creating 
an instruction for a Web browser to find the image when it displays the page.
So to display an image on your Web page, you need to upload both the page 
and the image when you publish your Web site. If your image files and the 
pages that refer to those files aren’t in the same relative location on your 
hard drive as they are on your Web server, you break the reference to your 
images, and an ugly broken image icon appears on your page. The best way 
to make sure that your images and files stay where they’re supposed to in 
relation to one another is to let Dreamweaver keep track of them for you. 
That’s why it’s so important to complete the site setup process at the begin-
ning of Chapter 2 and to make sure you never move or rename an image, 
except in the Files panel.

Why can’t I place images anywhere I want them?
You can’t just place your cursor anywhere on 
a page and insert an image where you want it. 
This isn’t a limitation of Dreamweaver; the way 
HTML is displayed on the Web restricts how 
you can place images.
By default, all images, text, and other elements 
are inserted starting at the top-left corner of the 
browser window. To create more complex lay-
outs and position images precisely on a page, 
your best option is to create a layout with CSS 
(which I cover in Chapters 5 and 6). You can 
also use an HTML table to position elements on 
a Web page (which I cover in Chapter 8).

 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
Image Editing in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver includes basic image-editing features, including the Crop, 
Resample, Brightness/Contrast, and Sharpen options. You find these tools 
next to the Border option in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 3-8. 
Image-editing features in Dreamweaver enable you to make minor changes to 
images without opening Fireworks, Photoshop, or any other graphics-editing 
program.

Before you get carried away editing your images, remember that 
Dreamweaver is primarily a Web page-creation application and isn’t really 
designed to edit graphics. Although these tools can be useful, they shouldn’t 
take the place of doing serious work on your graphics in a graphics applica-
tion, such as Fireworks or Photoshop.
 
When you use Dreamweaver’s image-editing tools, beware that you’re chang-
ing the actual image (not just a copy of it). Make sure you’re happy with these 
changes before you save the page you’re working on. You can use the Undo 
feature in Dreamweaver to revert back several steps, but after you save the 
page, you can’t undo changes made to an image with these tools. To protect 
your original image, save a copy before editing it.
Cropping an image
Essentially, cropping an image involves trimming the edges off of it. If you’re 
trying to fit an image into your design and need it to be just at touch smaller, 

88
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Dreamweaver’s cropping tool can come in handy. To crop a graphic or 
photo, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to crop by click-
ing it.
 
 The Property inspector changes to display the image’s properties.
 
2. Click the Crop icon (see Figure 3-9).
 
 A dialog box appears, warning you that cropping changes the original 
image.
 
 Don’t make the change if you’re concerned about keeping the entire 
image available. If you’re concerned, the best thing to do is to make a 
copy of the image before you crop it.
 
3. Click OK in the warning dialog box.
 
 A solid crop line with handles at the sides and corners appears over the 
image, as shown in Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Define the 
area to crop 
by dragging 
the edges of 
the cropping 
tool outline.
 
 
4. Click and drag the handles to outline the area of the image you want 
to keep.
 
 Any part of the image outside the crop line (and shaded) is deleted 
when the crop is completed.
 
5. Double-click inside the box or press Enter (Return on a Mac).
 
 The image is cropped.
 
You can undo cropping by choosing Edit➪Undo. However, after you save the 
page, changes permanently apply to the image and can’t be undone.

89
 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
Adjusting brightness and contrast
Adjusting an image’s brightness allows you to change the overall amount of 
light in an image. Contrast controls the difference between the light and dark 
areas of an image.
 
Using Dreamweaver’s editing tools permanently alters the image when the 
page is saved. If you’re concerned, the best thing to do is to make a copy of 
the image and make your adjustments to the copy.
To adjust brightness and contrast, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to alter.
 
 The Property inspector shows the image properties.
 
2. Click the Brightness and Contrast icon (labeled in Figure 3-8).
 
 A dialog box appears, indicating that the changes you make are made to 
the original file.
 
3. Click OK in the warning dialog box.
 
 The Brightness/Contrast dialog box appears.
 
4. Use the sliders to adjust the brightness and contrast settings of the 
image.
 
 Make sure to select the Preview check box if you want to see how the 
changes affect the image as you move the sliders around.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The settings take effect permanently when you save the page.
Sharpening an image
When you apply sharpening to an image, you increase the distinction between 
areas of color. The effect can increase the definition of shapes and lines in an 
image.
 
Using Dreamweaver’s editing tools permanently alters the image when the 
page is saved. If you’re concerned, the best thing to do is to make a copy of 
the image and make your adjustments to the copy.
To sharpen an image, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to sharpen.
 
 The Property inspector shows the image properties.

2. Click the Sharpen icon (labeled in Figure 3-8).
 
 A dialog box appears, warning that your change is made to the original 
file.
 
3. Click OK in the warning dialog box.
 
 The Sharpen dialog box appears.
 
4. Use the slider to adjust the sharpness of the image.
 
 Select the Preview check box to see how the changes affect the image as 
you move the slider.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The image is sharpened, and changes to the image become permanent 
when you save changes to the page.
Optimizing images in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver CS4 and CS5 include an Edit Image Settings icon that you can 
use to optimize images in the GIF, PNG, or JPEG formats by reducing the 
colors or increasing the compression, much as you can do in Photoshop or 
Fireworks. To use this feature, simply select any image in the Dreamweaver 
workspace and then click the Edit Image Settings icon in the Property inspec-
tor. (Hint: It looks like a two small gears and is labeled in Figure 3-8.)
 
Dreamweaver’s editing tools permanently alter the image when the page is 
saved. If you want to protect your original image, make a copy of the image 
before you make any changes.
To optimize an image in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to optimize.
 
 The Property inspector shows the image properties.
 
2. Click the Edit Image Settings icon (labeled in Figure 3-8).
 
 The Image Preview dialog box appears with the Options tab selected, as 
shown in Figure 3-10.
 
3. In the Format drop-down list, select the image format you want.
 
 If you want don’t want to change the format, skip this step. You can 
select the GIF, JPEG, or PNG format.
 
4. If you choose JPEG, use the slider that appears when you click the 
arrow next to Quality to select the level of compression. If you choose 
GIF or PNG, choose the number of colors desired.
 
 The image is altered based on the settings you specify.

7. Click OK to close the dialog and save your settings.
 
 When you save the page, your changes to the image become permanent.
 
You can also change other settings in the Image Preview dialog box, such as 
transparency settings for the GIF format, much as you would in Photoshop or 
Fireworks.
Opening an image in Photoshop or 
Fireworks from Dreamweaver
 
The Property inspector includes an icon that enables you to easily open an 
image in Photoshop or Fireworks from within Dreamweaver. The Edit icon 
changes to the icon of the program specified in Dreamweaver’s preferences. 
To open an image in your preferred program, simply select the image in 

92
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Dreamweaver, click the icon in the Property inspector, and watch your image 
appear as you’ve commanded.
Adobe has done great work integrating the Photoshop and Fireworks pro-
grams into Dreamweaver. When you save changes to the image in Fireworks 
or Photoshop, they’re automatically reflected in the version you’ve already 
inserted into a page in Dreamweaver.
To specify the image editor you want to associate with a file type in 
Dreamweaver’s preferences, follow these instructions:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences 
(on a Mac).
 
 The Preferences dialog box opens.
 
2. On the left, select the File Types/Editors Category, as shown in 
Figure 3-11.
 
3. In the Extensions pane, click to select .gif.
 
 Dreamweaver lists a wide variety of file types here, and you can associ-
ate any or all of them with your favorite editors. To associate image edi-
tors with these graphic formats, select the GIF, PNG, and JPEG options 
one at a time and then continue with these steps.
 
4. In the Editors pane, click to select the editor you want associated with 
the .gif format.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 3-11, Photoshop is listed already, so 
you can simply click Photoshop to select it. If you want to associate an 
editor that isn’t on this list, such as Fireworks, click the plus (+) sign just 
above the Editors pane, browse to find the program on your hard drive, 
and select it to make it appear on the list.
 
5. With the file type and program name selected, click the Make Primary 
button to associate the editor with the file type.
  
 The editor specified as Primary is launched automatically when you 
select an image in Dreamweaver and click the Edit button in the 
Property inspector.
 
6. Click to select .jpeg from the Extensions pane and repeat Steps 4 
and 5.
 
 You can continue with this process for any or all the other formats 
listed.
 
 To add additional file formats to Dreamweaver, click the plus (+) sign over 
the Extensions pane and type the extension beginning with a dot (.).

Inserting a Background Image
Background images can add depth and richness to a page design by adding 
color and fullness. Used cleverly, a background image helps create the illu-
sion that the entire page is one large image while still downloading quickly 
and efficiently. The trick is to use an image with a small file size that creates 
the impression of a large image. One way this works on the Web is to use 
the default settings for a background image, which cause the image to tile 
(repeat) across and down the page (see Figure 3-12).
 
Beware that certain backgrounds (such as the one shown in Figure 3-12) can 
make it difficult to read text placed on top. Choose your background images 
carefully and make sure your background and your text have plenty of con-
trast. Reading on a computer screen is hard enough.
 
With CSS, you can have far greater control over the display of a background 
image. When you create a CSS background style, you can insert a background 
image that doesn’t repeat or that repeats only across the Y axis or down the X 
axis of the page.
To insert a background image in Dreamweaver, choose Modify➪Page 
Properties, click the Browse button to the right of the Background Image field 
(see Figure 3-13), and select the image you want to use as your background. If 
the image isn’t already in your local site folder, Dreamweaver offers to copy 
it there when you click OK.

When you insert an image using Dreamweaver’s Page Properties feature, 
you can use the Repeat drop-down list to specify how the image repeats 
on the page, as shown in Figure 3-13. When you specify a repeat option, 
Dreamweaver automatically creates a style for the page with these back-
ground settings. If you use the CSS Definition dialog box to further edit the 
background options in the body style (covered in Chapter 5), you can also 
specify where the background image is displayed on a page.

 Chapter 3: Creating Web Graphics
Creating Image Maps
Image maps enable you to create hotspots (clickable areas) in an image and 
link each area to a different Web page. An image map is commonly used 
with a geographic map, such as the map of Northern California shown in 
Figure 3-14. Hotspots on the map link to different locations, depending on 
the section of the map a visitor clicks. For example, if you work for a national 
bank and want customers to find a local branch or ATM machine easily, you 
can create hotspots on an image map of the United States and then link each 
hotspot to a page listing banks in that geographic location.
Dreamweaver makes creating image maps easy by providing a set of simple 
drawing tools that enable you to create hotspots and set their corresponding 
links. To create an image map, follow these steps:
 
1. Place the image you want to use as an image map on your page.
 
2. Select the image.
 
 The image properties are displayed in the Property inspector.
 
3. To draw your hotspot, choose a shape tool from the image map tools 
in the lower left of the Property inspector (labeled in Figure 3-14).
 
 The shape tools (a rectangle, a circle, and an irregular polygon) allow 
you to draw the hotspot regions on your images, each with a specific 
link. In the example shown in Figure 3-14, I’m creating hotspots on each 
county in this map of Northern California.
 
4. With a shape tool selected, click and drag over an area of the image 
that you want to make hot (link to another page).
 
 Here’s how the different hotspot tools work:
 
• Rectangle: When you click and drag, a light blue highlight appears 
around the region that you’re making hot; this highlighted area 
indicates the active region. If you need to reposition the hot area, 
select the Pointer hotspot tool (labeled in Figure 3-14) and then 
select and move the region to the location you want. You can also 
resize the hotspot by clicking and dragging any corner.
 
• Circle: The Circle tool works much like the Rectangle tool — just 
click and drag. To resize a circle hotspot, select the Pointer hotspot 
tool, and click and drag one of the small square boxes on its edges.
 
• Polygon: The Polygon tool functions a little bit differently than the 
other two tools. To make a polygon selection, click the tool once 
for each point of the polygon shape you want to draw. The shape 
automatically connects the points while you click. When you’re fin-
ished, switch to another map tool or click outside the image. You 
can change the size of the polygon or move any of its points by 
using the Pointer hotspot tool.

 When prompted to describe the image map in the Alt field on the 
Property inspector, click OK to close the dialog box and then add 
a text description of the link in the Alt field in Hotspot properties 
of the Property inspector. The Alt field is for alternative text that 
doesn’t appear on the page itself. Screen readers and other devices 
that read the code behind a page need these hotspot descriptions 
to better understand the image map.
 
5. To link a selected hot area:
 
 
a. Click the Browse icon next to the Link text box (at the top of the 
Property inspector).
 
 
 The Select File dialog box opens.
 
b. Browse to find the HTML file that you want to link to the hotspot 
on your image.
 
c. Double-click the file to which you want to link.
 
 The hotspot links to the selected page, and the Select File dialog 
box automatically closes.
 
 You can also type the path directly in the Link text box.

6. To add more hotspots, choose an image and a shape tool, and repeat 
Steps 4 and 5.
 
7. To give your image map a name, type a name in the Map text field, 
just above the shape tools.
 
 Giving your map (and all the hotspots it includes) a name helps to dis-
tinguish it in the event that you have multiple image maps on the same 
page. You can call the map anything you want, as long as you don’t 
include spaces or special punctuation.
 
 When you finish, a light blue highlight indicates where all your image 
map hotspots are.
 
At any time, you can edit the image map. Simply click and highlight the blue 
region on your image and drag the edges to resize the hotspot or enter a new 
URL to change the link.

▶ Testing your site with the Dreamweaver site reporting features
▶ Fixing broken links
▶ Moving and changing filenames and links
▶ Setting up FTP and other file transfer options
▶ Publishing your site to a Web server
T
he scenario is shocking: You create a page design that looks just perfect 
in your favorite Web browser on your own computer. You publish it 
on the Internet and tell all your friends. And the next thing you know, your 
cousin in Chicago and your friends in Italy are telling you that it looks ter-
rible, the text is unreadable, and your video files won’t play at all.
Don’t let this happen to you. Take time to test your work before you publish 
it to ensure your site works well in the many different Web browsers, operat-
ing systems, and monitor sizes that your visitors are likely to use on today’s 
increasingly international Internet. You also want to use Dreamweaver’s tools 
to check that your site code is valid, the links all work, and everything is in 
tip-top shape before you publish it on the Web. As you work with the files in 
your site, you may appreciate that Dreamweaver includes tools for managing 
files and folders so that your links stay up-to-date as your site grows. And 
when you’re ready to publish or update your site on the Web, Dreamweaver 
has tools to help you transfer files, too. In this chapter, you discover how to 
use these features, as well as a few tips I’ve learned along the way.

Why Can Web Pages Look Bad 
on Different Computers?
A confusing and frustrating aspect of Web design is that different browsers and 
computer systems impact a page’s appearance. You can create a page that looks 
great in Dreamweaver and test it in a browser to confirm that it looks fine only 
to discover later that it looks terrible in another Web browser or on a different 
computer system. Web pages can look different from one system to another for 
many reasons, but the following issues are the most common culprits:
 
✓ Browser differences: Today, dozens of browsers are in use on the Web, 
not counting the different versions of each browser. For example, at the 
time of this writing, Internet Explorer (IE) 8 is the newest release from 
Microsoft, but a significant percentage of Web users haven’t upgraded 
yet and are still using IE7 or even earlier versions. (More on browser dif-
ferences in the next section.)
 
✓ Hardware differences: Another challenge comes from the differences 
between Macintosh and Windows computers. For example, most fonts 
appear smaller on a Macintosh than on a PC. (Times 12 on a PC looks 
like Times 10 on a Mac, which makes text harder to read and can change 
the layout of a page.) Image colors and brightness can also vary from 
one computer to another.
 
✓ Individual preferences: Most Web browsers include preference settings 
that individual users can adjust to suit their needs. For example, some-
one may increase the text size in his browser settings to make text more 
readable, which may cause text to wrap your carefully designed pages to 
look overly crowded page designs and text wrapping changes that may 
make your look terrible.
 
✓ Monitor resolution settings: In addition, the same Web page may look 
very different on a 21" monitor than it does on a 15" monitor. And even 
on the same monitor, different resolution settings can alter the way a 
page looks. On a PC, a common resolution is 1024 x 768; on a Mac, the 
resolution is generally set much higher, making the design look much 
smaller, even if the monitor sizes are the same.
As a result of all these differences, the same Web page can look very differ-
ent to the many people who visit a Web site. For example, Figure 4-1 shows a 
Web page in Internet Explorer on a PC, and Figure 4-2 shows the same page in 
Safari on a Macintosh. Notice that the text displays in a larger font size on the 
PC, changing how the text wraps around the photo in the left column.
This challenging aspect of the Web is at the root of many of the limitations and 
complications of creating good Web designs. With patience, testing, and an under-
standing of the tags and styles that are most problematic, you can create great 
Web sites that look good to most, if not all, of the people who visit your Web site.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Understanding browser differences
Of the many reasons why Web pages can look different from one browser to 
another, it boils down to this: 
 
✓ Over the years, Web browsers have evolved to support new Web tech-
nologies. Thus, many older browsers still in use have trouble displaying 
some newer, more advanced features that you can use on your Web 
pages today. 
 
✓ Compounding this problem, the companies that make Web browsers — 
including Microsoft, Google, and Apple — don’t all agree or follow the 
same rules (although most are getting better at complying with the same 
set of standards in their latest browser versions).
 
✓ Dozens of browsers are now in use on the Web, not counting the differ-
ent versions of each browser. For example, Firefox has become increas-
ingly popular and is one of the best for supporting pages designed 
to follow modern Web design standards, but a significant percentage 
of Internet users haven’t yet changed or upgraded and are still using 
the browser that came with their computer. If that browser is IE6, it’s 
especially unfortunate because IE6 is notoriously bad at displaying CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets) and other modern Web features.
Browser limitations and differences are the root of many limitations and 
complications of creating Web sites. Appreciating these challenges as you 
learn to create pages is helpful. HTML was designed to create simple text 
documents that could be viewed on any computer on the planet. As you learn 
Web design, some of the rules may seem strange or limiting at first. But if you 
understand the reasons for working within these limitations, creating sites 
can go more smoothly for you.
Entire books and Web sites are dedicated to how best to design for the differ-
ences among browsers. I can’t possibly cover all the issues or tricks to work-
ing around them in this book. However, in this chapter, I do include tips and 
testing sites to help you ensure your pages look their best, and throughout 
this book, I try to stick to design strategies and techniques that most brows-
ers in use today support. 
Targeting browsers for your design
Some Web designers have decided to ignore users with older browsers or 
to simply include a warning message, such as: “This page looks best in the 
latest version of Firefox, upgrade now.” Other designers carefully test their 
pages in browsers such as IE 6 to make sure they look good even to the least 

103
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
sophisticated users on the Internet. As you decide how to approach this 
issue, I suggest taking your audience into account. For example, consider the 
following scenarios:
 
✓ Your visitors are advanced computer users. In this case, you may not 
need to concern yourself as much with older browsers but watch out 
for niche browsers. Advanced computer users are much more likely to 
update their computers and also to customize their computer with a 
browser like Firefox (initially a niche browser that’s very popular today) 
or Chrome (a newer player on the Web, with increasing popularity).
 
✓ Your audience attracts users mostly from large corporations. These 
users often cannot update their own software, so they’re stuck with 
older browsers until the company policy changes, which can take a 
notoriously long time. That said, if you’re designing a site only for use by 
people within the company, you can often find out exactly what software 
they are using and design specifically for their systems.
 
✓ Your audience is made up of people with older computers who are 
unlikely to have upgraded their Web browsers. For this audience, 
design Web pages with older browsers in mind. Although Web browsers 
are generally free, and relatively easy to install, some people are afraid 
to download any software over the Internet, and many don’t appreciate 
the benefits of using a newer browser.
Today there is a growing movement toward more standardized Web develop-
ment, but getting your pages to look exactly the same on every computer on 
the planet today is still difficult if not impossible. As a result, most designers 
strive to create pages that look as good as possible on as many browsers as 
they consider important, even if the same pages don’t look exactly the same 
on all browsers.
Which browsers you should design for depends on your audience. If you 
have the luxury of having accurate reports on the visitors to your site, you 
can see a list of all browsers that visitors to your site use. (In Chapter 15 you 
find a list of Web-statistic services that include browser usage information.) 
 
The statistics in this list are from the trends page at www.w3schools.com/
browsers/browsers_stats.asp. (The site is updated monthly, so check 
the site for the most recent stats.) Assume for now that your Web statistics 
reveal that your audience’s browser usage follows the trend and breaks down 
as follows:
 
✓ IE8: 13.5 percent
 
✓ IE7: 12.8 percent of your audience uses

104
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
✓ IE6: 10.9 percent
 
✓ Firefox 3: 46.4 percent 
 
✓ Chrome: 9.8 percent
 
✓ Safari: 3.6 percent
 
✓ Opera: 2.3 percent
With those numbers in mind, you may decide to design pages so that that 
they look best in Firefox, and you’ll settle for them not looking quite as good 
in Safari and Chrome because such a small percentage of your visitors use 
those browsers.
Previewing Your Page in a Browser
Although Dreamweaver displays Web pages much like a Web browser, not all 
interactive features work in Dreamweaver. To test links, for example, preview 
your work in a Web browser.
 
The simplest way to preview your work is to save the page you’re working on 
and then click the Preview/Debug in Browser icon located at the top right of 
the workspace, as shown in Figure 4-3 (it looks like a small globe). You can 
also choose File➪Preview in a Browser.
When you install Dreamweaver, it should automatically find all the brows-
ers installed on your computer and set them up so that you can easily select 
them to preview your pages.

105
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
Testing your pages in more than one Web browser is always a good prac-
tice, because page display can vary (sometimes dramatically) from one 
Web browser to another. How many browsers you should test your pages in 
depends on the audience you expect to visit your Web site and your access 
to browsers and different operating systems. Most good Web designers test 
their pages in many different browsers, including the latest two or three ver-
sions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. It’s also good practice 
to preview your pages on both Macintosh and Windows computers because 
the page display differs from one operating system to another.
To help you test your pages, Dreamweaver includes a few special features, 
including the ability to add more browsers to the preview option as you 
install them on your hard drive. You can also use Adobe’s BrowserLab 
option, which tests a Web page in multiple Web browsers and returns images 
of the page as it looks in each browser. BrowserLab, discussed later in this 
section, can help you quickly identify potential problems in the way a page 
looks in different browsers. The following sections explain the many tools 
available to you in more detail.
Adding Web browsers to Dreamweaver
Before you can preview your Web pages in different browsers, you need 
to set up Dreamweaver to support them. The first step is to download 
and install a variety of browsers on your hard drive (see the sidebar 
“Downloading new browsers”). 
After you’ve installed one or more new browsers on your computer, follow 
these steps to add them to Dreamweaver’s browser preview list:
 
1. Choose File➪Preview in Browser and then choose Edit Browser List 
from the fly-out menu.
 
 The Preferences dialog box opens with the Preview in Browser settings 
displayed. Note: You must have a page open in Dreamweaver for these 
menu options to be accessible.
 
2. Click the plus (+) sign next to the word Browsers, at the top of the 
Preferences dialog box.
 
 The Add Browser dialog box opens. 
 
3. Enter a name for the browser. 
 
 I like to include the version number as well as the name, as I have in the 
example shown in Figure 4-4 for Firefox 3.

106
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
4. Click the Browse button.
 
 The Add Browser dialog box opens.
 
5. Navigate your hard drive until you find the browser you want to add. 
Look for the browser’s executable or application file (indicated with 
an .exe extension on Windows and stored in the Applications folder 
on a Mac) rather than a shortcut on your desktop.
 
 You can add a browser to Dreamweaver only if the browser is on your 
hard drive. (See the nearby sidebar, “Downloading new browsers,” for 
more about finding and downloading new browsers for testing.)
 
6. Click the name of the .exe file to select it, and then click Open to add 
the browser to the Application field in the Add Browser dialog box. 
 
7. Select the Primary Browser check box if you want this browser to be 
the browser that’s listed first in the Browser drop-down list (see Figure 
4-4). Select the Secondary Browser check box to make a browser 
second on the list.
 
 You can also launch the designated primary browser by pressing the 
F12 key. To launch the secondary browser, press Ctrl+F12 in Windows 
or Ô+F12 on a Mac.
 
8. Repeat Steps 2–7 to add more browsers to the list.

Previewing pages in many Web browsers
When you preview pages, preview in a variety of Web browsers. Then make 
any necessary adjustments to the designs based on what you find. This way, 

107
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
you make sure that your site looks suitable to at least most of your visitors. 
The following steps walk you through the process of previewing the same 
Web page in multiple browsers:
 
1. Open a Web page that you want to preview in Dreamweaver. Then, 
choose File➪Preview in Browser, and select a Web browser from the 
list of browser options. 
 
 You find out how to add more browsers to the Preview in Browser list in 
the preceding section, “Adding Web browsers to Dreamweaver.”
 
2. Study the page carefully, testing all the links, rollovers, and any other 
special effects to make sure that the page appears the way you want it 
to in this browser.
 
3. Close the browser window and return to Dreamweaver to make any 
necessary changes to the page.
 
 Often, making minor changes, such as swapping the position of an image 
with a block of text, or adding a paragraph return using a <p> tag after a 
video, can make the page look much better.
 
4. Preview the same page again in the same browser to make sure the 
changes you made had the desired effect.
 
 Return to Dreamweaver to make further changes as necessary.
 
5. Preview the same page in another Web browser. 
 
 If you’re not happy with the way the page looks in this browser, make 
further adjustments to the design in Dreamweaver. 
Downloading new browsers
So how do you put new browsers on your hard 
drive so that you can preview your pages with 
them? The simplest way is to visit the Web sites 
of the companies that create the most popular 
browsers. You can download the latest version 
for free from each of these sites, and all four 
browsers are available for Mac and Windows 
computers:
Microsoft Internet Explorer: www.microsoft.
com/ie
Mozilla Firefox: www.firefox.com
Apple Safari: www.apple.com/safari
Google Chrome: www.google.com/
chrome

108
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
If you’re not sure what may be causing the problems among browsers, try 
using the Browser Compatibility testing features, covered later in this chap-
ter. When you do this test, Dreamweaver gives you list of any known issues it 
finds in your page design, a handy reference that can help you find and solve 
common problems that affect the display of pages in different Web browsers.
 
Sometimes, a workflow different from one outlined in the preceding steps 
works better. You may find that previewing the same page in a few browsers 
in rapid succession, noting any differences among them, works best. Then, 
you can make any necessary changes in Dreamweaver, and preview the same 
page again in all the same browsers. This strategy can help ensure that you 
create a page that looks as good as possible in the most browsers and reduces 
the risk that changes you make to improve the design in one browser make 
the page look worse in another browser without your realizing it.
Testing sites with Adobe’s BrowserLab and 
other online browser emulators
Unless you own a dozen computers with different operating systems and a 
vast collection of Web browsers, you can’t fully test your Web site — at least 
not on your own. Fortunately, a growing number of online services are avail-
able to help you preview your pages on many different operating systems 
and browsers — without your having to manage multiple computers and 
browsers yourself.
Like many professional Web designers, I have three computers on my desk 
(Macs and Windows) and many different browsers installed on each. I like 
having several options handy so that I can test my pages as I’m developing 
a design, especially because you have to upload your pages to a Web server 
before you can use the online services listed here. 
After a page design looks good in all the browsers and systems I have on my 
desk, I upload the site to a server and do a final test in even more browsers 
using these online services.
Here are some of the best places to test your Web site online:
 
✓ Adobe BrowserLab: (https://browserlab.adobe.com) In 
Dreamweaver CS5, Adobe BrowserLab is integrated into the browser 
preview options in Dreamweaver. You can choose it from the list of 
options when you choose Edit➪Preview in Browser. Note: Your 

109
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
computer must be connected to the Internet for this feature to work, 
and you can also use BrowserLab to test any page that’s already pub-
lished on the Internet.
 
 Adobe BrowserLab enables you to test any Web page in the most 
common browsers on the Web simultaneously. At the time of this writ-
ing, that includes IE versions 6, 7, and 8; Mozilla Firefox versions 2 and 3; 
Chrome 3; and Apple Safari versions 3 and 4. 
 
 You can also test pages on different operating systems, such as 
Windows XP and Mac OS X. When you use this service, the result is a 
screenshot with a preview of the page taken in each browser. Although 
the screenshots enable you to spot differences quickly, be aware of 
a small downside: You can’t test interactive features, such as drop-
down menus or rollover effects. You must have an Adobe ID to use 
BrowserLab, but at the time of this writing it was free to anyone using 
Dreamweaver.
 
✓ Browser Sandbox: (http://spoon.net/browsers/) With Browser 
Sandbox, you can easily test a site using any of the eight most popular 
browsers without installing them all on your system. You simply down-
load and install a plug-in from the Web site and then click the browser 
you want to use. After the selected browser launches, you can surf the 
Web as if the browser were installed on your computer. The service is 
free (at the time of this writing). And because you can surf through the 
browsers, you can interact with Web sites, testing all your pages, as well 
as JavaScript, AJAX, and other interactive features.
 
✓ Cross Browser Testing: (www.crossbrowsertesting.com) The Cross 
Browser Testing site takes Web site–testing to another level. Instead of 
simply providing screenshots of a Web page in different browsers, or 
letting you launch a few browsers to test pages in, this site lets you take 
over other computers connected to the Internet so that you can test 
interactive features using a variety of browsers and operating systems. 
For example, if you use a computer that runs Windows Vista and you 
want to see what your site will look like on a Mac, you can choose to use 
a computer with the Mac OS and then view your site in any of a dozen 
browsers on the Mac system. The advantage is that you get more than 
snapshots, and you also can test interactive features, such as JavaScript, 
AJAX, forms, and more. This service requires that you purchase a 
monthly subscription.
 
✓ Browsershots: (www.browsershots.org) Browsershots is a popu-
lar online testing tool. You simply enter a page’s URL and choose the 
options you want to use for testing. Browsershots then tests the page 
you submitted on each computer system selected with the specified 

110
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
browser and takes a screenshot. Although you can’t test interactive fea-
tures with this service, it’s one of the easiest options and provides the 
largest collection of browsers to choose from. The basic service is free, 
but it can take a few minutes or a few hours to complete testing. If you 
don’t like waiting, you can upgrade to “priority processing” for a fee.
Using Dreamweaver’s Browser 
Compatibility feature
In addition to being able to preview a Web page in any Web browser on your 
hard drive, Dreamweaver also includes a Browser Compatibility feature that 
can help you test for known issues among different browsers automatically.
To use this feature, open a page in Dreamweaver and choose File➪Check 
Page➪Browser Compatibility. You can also access this feature by clicking the 
Check Page drop-down arrow at the top right of the workspace and selecting 
Check Browser Compatibility from the drop-down list. Any recognized con-
flicts display in a report at the bottom of the workspace.
You can specify which browsers and browser versions you want to target 
by doing either of the following to open the Target Browser dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 4-5:
 
✓ Click the small menu icon at the top-left corner of the Browser 
Compatibility Check dialog box and choose Settings from the drop-down 
list.
 
✓ From the Check Page drop-down list, choose Settings.

Testing your designs in mobile phone 
emulators with Adobe Device Central
Device Central, which was included in previous versions of Dreamweaver, is 
increasingly important as more and more people are surfing the Web with 
cell phones and other mobile devices.
Device Central works much like the other preview options but with a few 
extra features, including the ability to add new phone profiles.
Follow these steps to preview your pages using Device Central:
 
1. Open a Web page that you want to preview in Dreamweaver. Then, 
choose File➪Preview in Browser, and select Device Central from the 
list of options. 
 
 The page opens in Device Central, which displays the page in one of the 
many mobile emulators installed in the program, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
2. In the Test Devices panel on the left, click to select any device.
 
 The page you’re previewing is displayed in that device. In the Test 
Devices panel, you can click one device after another in the list to view 
the page in multiple devices.
 
3. Study the page carefully, testing all the links, rollovers, and any other 
special effects to make sure that the page appears the way you want it 
to in this mobile device.
 
 You navigate around the Web page that appears in a test device much 
like you would if you had the real mobile device. For example, use your 
mouse to click on the navigation arrows just above the keypad (see 
Figure 4-6) to scroll up, down, left, and right in the Web page.
 
4. Close Device Central and return to Dreamweaver to make any neces-
sary changes to the page.
 
 See the nearby sidebar, “Designing for mobile devices,” for tips about 
creating a design that displays well on cell phones.
 
You can add more devices to Adobe Device Central on a Windows computer 
by choosing Devices➪Download Device Profile, but your computer must be 
connected to the Internet for this feature to work. On a Mac, choose Add to 
Test Devices.

Designing for mobile devices
A new audience of Web page visitors has 
emerged. Some high-end mobile devices (think 
iPhone and BlackBerry Storm) are capable of 
loading even complex Web pages and do so 
reasonably well. However, the screen is much 
smaller, and interaction with the Web browser 
is much different. Site visitors navigate by touch 
or with input devices more challenging than a 
mouse. Lower-end mobile devices that make 
up the vast majority of the market often have 
even smaller screens, reduced color display, 
and allow only minimal interaction.
To best manage the dramatic differences on 
mobile devices, my best recommendation is 
that you create a second, very simplified ver-
sion of your Web site designed to best serve the 
limited display options of mobile devices and 
then link your main Web site to the alternate 
mobile design. If you have experience writing 
server scripts (or can hire someone to do it for 
you), you can create an autodetect script that 
can determine whether a visitor to your site is 
using a mobile phone or a computer and then 
direct them to the best version of your site auto-
matically.
Here are a few important tips to consider when 
designing a version of your Web site for mobile 
devices:
 ✓ Because download times are much slower 
on mobile devices, adjust the number of fea-
tures you offer to mobile devices, and keep 
the number of images and style minimal.
 ✓ Use CSS for the design and layout of the 
Web page, but limit the design to internal 
style sheets, not external. (See Chapter 5 
for more on CSS.)

 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
Testing Your Work with the 
Site Reporting Features
Before you put your site online for the world to see, check your work using 
the Dreamweaver Site Reporting feature. You can create a variety of reports 
and even customize them to identify problems with external links, redundant 
and empty tags, untitled documents, and missing alternate text. You can 
easily miss things — especially when you work on a tight deadline — and 
what you miss can cause real problems for your viewers.
 ✓ Avoid outdated HTML styling and layout 
options, such as frames and iframes, which 
may not display at all on mobile devices.
 ✓ Screen size on a mobile device is extremely 
limited, with less width or height than tradi-
tional computer monitors. (The view is more 
rectangular than square on most mobile 
screens.) Optimize your content and design 
accordingly.
 ✓ Users don’t point with a mouse on a mobile 
phone. They use up and down arrows, and 
at best a touch screen. Adjust your design 
to require as little scrolling and user move-
ment as possible and make sure links are 
big and well separated from each other so 
they are easy to click.
 ✓ Always validate your Web page code 
(numerous validation services are avail-
able for free online, such as the popular 
one at http://validator.w3.org). 
Mobile browsers are even less forgiving 
than traditional Web site browsers about 
errors in your code.
 ✓ Very few mobile devices support 
JavaScript, so don’t use it in the mobile ver-
sion of a Web site. That means try to avoid 
drop-down menus or rollover images in the 
mobile version of your site.
 ✓ Most mobile devices don’t support Flash, 
Flash video, or most other multimedia 
formats so avoiding them is best. If you do 
use Flash, phones that don’t support it will 
display a blank screen. Use multimedia 
sparingly and make sure to include links to 
alternative content for visitors who may not 
be able to view these features.
You also need to test a mobile site in addition 
to your main Web site. Test with mobile phone 
emulators, such as Dreamweaver’s Device 
Central (featured in this chapter), as well as 
the online emulators available at http://
ready.mobi and http://mtld.mobi/
emulator.php. Test interactive features on 
a variety of mobile phones. If you can’t afford to 
buy several phones (and who can?), ask your 
friends, family, and coworkers to test your site 
on their phones. Visit stores that sell mobile 
phones and ask for a demo of the phone’s Web 
browser capabilities; then make sure to view 
your own site while you’re testing each phone. 
Although it can take some time to run around 
town visiting mobile phone stores and doing 
demos, it’s a cheap way to test in a variety of 
modern devices, and you might even find your 
new favorite phone.

devices, check out my book Mobile Web Design 
For Dummies.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Before Dreamweaver added this great feature, finding these kinds of mistakes 
was a tedious, time-consuming task. Now you can run a report that identifies 
these errors for you in a matter of moments, and then use Dreamweaver to 
correct mistakes across your entire site automatically.
Follow these steps to produce a Site Report of your entire Web site:
 
1. In the drop-down list at the top of the Files panel, select the site you 
want to work on.
 
 If you already have the site you want to test open in Dreamweaver, you 
can skip this step. Note: Your site appears in the Files panel list only if 
you’ve completed the site setup process covered in Chapter 2.
 
2. Make sure any documents you have open in Dreamweaver’s work-
space are saved by choosing File➪Save All.
 
3. Choose Site➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears (see Figure 4-7).
 
Figure 4-7: 
In the 
Reports dia-
log box, you 
can select 
any and all 
options and 
run reports 
on a single 
page or the 
entire site.
 
 
4. In the Report On drop-down list, choose Entire Current Local Site.
 
 I most commonly use this feature to test an entire site just before pub-
lishing it to the Web, but you can choose to check only a single page by 
opening the page in Dreamweaver and then choosing Current Document 
in the Report On drop-down list. You can also run a report on selected 
files or on a particular folder. If you choose Selected Files in Site, you 
must first click to select the pages you want to check in the Files panel.
 
5. In the Select Reports section, click the check boxes to select the 
reports you want.
 
 Table 4-1 describes the kind of report you get with each option. You can 
select as many reports as you want.

115
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
 
6. Click the Run button to create the report(s).
 
 If you haven’t already done so, you may be prompted to save your file, 
set up your site, or select a folder. (See Chapter 2 for more information 
on setting up a site in Dreamweaver.)
 
 The Results panel appears, as shown in Figure 4-8, displaying a list of 
problems found on the site. To sort the list by category (filename, line 
number, or description), click the corresponding column heading.
 
Figure 4-8: 
The Results 
panel dis-
plays a list 
of problems 
on your site.
 
 
7. Double-click any item in the Results panel to open the corresponding 
file in the Document window.
 
 The file opens, and the error is highlighted in the workspace.
 
 You can also right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) on any line of 
the report and choose More Info to find additional details about the spe-
cific error or condition.
 
8. Use the Property inspector or another Dreamweaver feature to correct 
the identified problem and then save the file.

Table 4-1 (continued)
Report Name
What It Does
Combinable 
Nested Font 
Tags 
Lists all instances where you can combine nested tags. 
For example, <font color=”#000000”><font 
size=”2”>Great Web Sites You Should 
Visit</font></font> is listed because you can sim-
plify the code by combining the two font tags into <font 
color=”#000000” size=”2”>Great Web Sites 
You Should Visit</font>.
Missing Alt 
Text 
Lists all the image tags that do not include Alt text. Alt text is a 
text description for an image tag included in the HTML code as 
an alternative if the image is not displayed. Alt text is important 
to anyone who uses a special browser that reads Web pages. 
Redundant 
Nested Tags
Lists all places where you have redundant nested tags. For 
example, <h1>Good headlines <h1>are harder 
to write</h1> than you might think</h1> 
is listed because you can simplify the code by removing the 
second <h1> tag to make the code look like this: <h1>Good 
headlines are harder to write than you 
might think</h1>.
Removable 
Empty Tags
Lists the empty tags on your site. Empty tags can occur when 
you delete an image, text section, or other element without 
deleting all the tags applied to the element.
Untitled 
Documents
Lists filenames that don’t have a title. The title tag is easy to 
forget because it does not appear in the body of the page. The 
title tag specifies the text that appears at the very top of the 
browser window and also the text that appears in the Favorites 
list when someone bookmarks a page. You can enter a title for 
any page by entering text in the title field just above the work 
area or in the title field in the Page Properties dialog box.
Finding and Fixing Broken Links
If you’re trying to rein in a chaotic Web site or if you just want to check a site 
for broken links, you’ll be pleased to discover the Link Checker. You can use 
this feature to verify the links in a single file or an entire Web site, and Link 
Checker can automatically fix all the referring links at once if a link is broken. 
(You find instructions for creating links in Chapter 2.)
Here’s an example of what Link Checker can do. Assume that someone on 
your team (because you would never do such a thing yourself) changed the 

117
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
name of a file from new.htm to old.htm without using the Files panel or 
any of Dreamweaver’s automatic link update features. Maybe this person 
changed the name using another program or simply renamed it in Explorer 
(Windows) or the Finder (Mac). Changing the filename was easy, but what 
this person may not have realized is that if he or she didn’t change the links 
to the file when the file was renamed, the links are now broken.
If only one page links to the file that your clueless teammate changed, fixing 
the broken link isn’t such a big deal. As long as you remember which file the 
page links from, you can simply open that page and use the Property inspec-
tor to reset the link the same way you created the link in the first place. 
But many times, a single page in a Web site is linked to many other pages. 
When that’s the case, fixing all the link references can be time-consuming, 
and forgetting some of them is all too easy. That’s why the Link Checker is so 
helpful. 
 
If you’re working on a dynamic, database-driven site or if your site was 
altered with programming that was performed outside Dreamweaver, the Link 
Checker may not work properly. The Link Checker works best for sites with 
static HTML pages and sites created using .dwt Dreamweaver templates. 
 
You must have the entire site on your hard drive and you must have com-
pleted the site setup process, covered in Chapter 2, for the Link Checker to 
work properly.
Checking for broken links
To check a site for broken links, follow these steps:
 
1. In the drop-down list at the top of the Files panel, select the site you 
want to work on.
 
 If you already have the site open in Dreamweaver, you can skip this step. 
For more information on how to set up a new site or import an existing 
one, see Chapter 2.
 
2. Choose Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
 
 The Link Checker tab, shown in Figure 4-9, opens in the Results panel 
at the bottom of the page, just under the Property inspector. The tab 
displays a list of internal and external links. The tab also lists any pages, 
images, or other items not linked from any other page in the site — 
dubbed orphans. Unused images can waste space on your server, so this 
list is handy if you want to clean up old images or other elements you no 
longer use on the site.

118
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 Most service providers limit the amount of space on your server and 
charge extra if you exceed that limit. You can save valuable server space 
by deleting unused files, especially if they’re image or multimedia files. 
But remember, just because you delete them from your hard drive 
doesn’t mean they’re deleted from the server. Make sure you remove 
them from the Remote Site window in the Files panel as well as the Local 
Site panel. (For more on using FTP and synchronization to update or 
delete files on your server, see the section “Publishing Your Web Site,” 
later in this chapter.)
 
Figure 4-9: 
The report 
can be 
organized 
by broken 
links, exter-
nal links, 
and unused 
files.
 
Fixing broken links
Broken links are one of the worst problems you can have on a Web site. After 
you identify a broken link in a site, fix it as soon as possible. Nothing turns off 
visitors faster than clicking a link and getting a File Not Found error page. 
Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes fixing broken links simple by providing 
quick access to files with broken links and automating the process of fixing 
multiple links to the same file.
After using the Link Checker tab described in the preceding section to iden-
tify broken links, follow these steps to fix them by using the Results panel:
 
1. With the Results panel open at the bottom of the page, double-click a 
filename that Dreamweaver identifies as a broken link.
 
 The page and its corresponding Property inspector open. The Results 
panel remains visible.
 
2. Select the broken link or image on the open page.
 
 For example, you can fix a broken image by selecting the broken image 
icon on the page and then reinserting the image using the Property 
inspector to find the correct image file.
 
3. In the Property inspector, click the Browse button (which looks like a 
folder) to the right of the Src text box.

119
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
 
 (Alternatively, you can type the correct filename and path in the text 
box instead of using the Browse button to find the correct image.) The 
Select Image Source dialog box appears. 
 
 You fix links to pages just as you fix links to images, except you type the 
name of the correct file into the Link text box or click the Browse button 
(which looks like a folder) next to the Link text box to find the file in 
your site folder.
 
4. Click to select the filename of the correct image and then click OK.
 
 The link automatically changes to reflect the new filename and location. 
If you replace an image, the image file reappears on the page.
 
 If the link that you correct appears in multiple pages and you fix the link 
using the broken link’s Results panel, Dreamweaver prompts you with 
a dialog box asking whether you want to fix the remaining broken link 
references to the file. Click the Yes button to automatically correct all 
other references. Click the No button to leave the other files unchanged.
Finding files by their addresses
If you’re not sure where you saved a file or 
what you called it, but you can get to it with 
your browser, you can determine the file-
name and location by looking at the URL in the 
browser’s address bar. Each folder in a Web 
site is included in the address to a page within 
that folder. Folder names are separated by the 
forward slash, /, and each filename can be dis-
tinguished because it includes an extension. 
For example, the URL in the browser’s address 
bar of the About the Farm page in the Dexter 
Tree Farm site tells me that the file is named 
about-dexter-tree-farm.html. (See 
the top of the figure in this sidebar.)
Similarly, you can identify the name and loca-
tion of any image you’re viewing on a Web 
page. If you’re using Internet Explorer or 
Firefox, place your cursor over the image and 
right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) 
and then choose Properties. The Element 
Properties dialog box includes the specific 
URL of the image, which has the name and 
folder (path). In the Element Properties dialog 
box shown in this example, you can see the 
path to the logo on this site is http://www.
dextertreefarm.com/images/
Dexter-Tree-Farm.jpg, which tells me 
that the logo that appears in the top of the page 
is named Dexter-Tree-Farm.jpg and is 
stored in an images folder. If you’re using the 
Safari browser on a Mac, it works a little differ-
ently: Control+click an image and choose Open 
Image in New Window. In the new window, the 
image URL appears in the location bar.

120
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Managing Files and Folders in Your Site
Dreamweaver includes a variety of tools that help you manage the files, fold-
ers, and subfolders within a site without breaking links or image references. 
You can use the Files panel to rename and rearrange files and folders, as well 
as create new folders, all with drag-and-drop ease.
 
You need to complete the simple site setup process for Dreamweaver’s 
Files panel features to work. If you haven’t already set up your site, turn to 
the instructions at the beginning of Chapter 2. (If you’re getting tired of my 
reminding you of this point throughout this book, I’m sorry, but I’m guess-
ing you’d be even more annoyed if you didn’t know this was necessary and 
couldn’t get these features to work.)
Moving and renaming files
To move or rename files in a Web site, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the site you want to work on (if it’s not already open in 
Dreamweaver) by selecting the site name from the drop-down list at 
the top of the Files panel.
 
 When you select a site by clicking the site name, the folders and files in 
that site appear in the Files panel.
 
2. Click the plus (+) sign (Windows) or the small arrow (Mac) to open the 
local site folder or any subfolder to display the files within the folder.
 
 Click the minus (–) sign to close a folder or subfolder.
 
3. In the Files panel, select the file or folder you want to move or rename.
 
 To move a selected file or folder:
 
a. Drag the selected file or group of files onto a folder.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically moves the files into the folder and 
changes all the related links. The Files panel works much like 
the Explorer window on a PC or the Finder on a Mac, except 
Dreamweaver tracks and fixes links when you move files through the 
Files panel. 
 
 If you move or rename files or folders in the Finder or Explorer on 
your computer instead of in the Files panel, you will break any links 
set to or from those files and any image references within them.
 
 When you move a linked file into a new folder in Dreamweaver, the 
Update Files dialog box appears, listing any linked pages that need 
to be updated, as shown in Figure 4-10.
 
b. To adjust the links so they don’t break, choose Update.

121
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
 
 If you choose Don’t Update, any links to or from that file are left 
unchanged. Of course, you can always move the file back to its 
original location to restore the links.
 
 To rename a selected file:
 
a. Click twice on any filename or folder name.
 
 Much like the Finder or Explorer on your computer, you need to 
click twice with a slight pause between clicks to select the name 
(instead of double-clicking, which opens the file).
 
b. When a box appears around the name, edit it by typing in new 
text, just as you would change a filename in the Finder or 
Explorer. Press Enter (Return on a Mac) to complete the change.
 
 Again you’re prompted with the Update Files dialog box to update 
any links affected by the filename change.
 
c. Choose Update to adjust the links.
 
 To create a new folder in the Files panel:
 
a. Right-click (Option-click on a Mac) on the main site folder or any 
subfolder where you want to create a new folder.
 
 A list of options appears.
 
b. Choose New Folder from the list.
 
 A new, untitled folder appears inside the folder you selected in Step a.
 
c. Name the new folder by typing new text to replace the word 
Untitled.
 
 After you’ve created a new folder, you can click and drag to move 
files or other folders in the Files panel into the folder.
 
 To delete a folder or file from the Files panel:
 
a. Click to select the file or folder.
 
b. Press the Delete or Backspace key.
 
 This will permanently delete the file from your hard drive.
 
Figure 4-10: 
The Update 
Files dialog 
box lists 
all the files 
that will be 
changed 
during the 
update 
process. 

122
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Making global changes to links
If you want to globally change a link to point at a new URL or to some other 
page on your site, you can use the Change Link Sitewide option to enter the 
new URL and change every reference automatically. You can use this option 
to change any kind of link, including mailto, ftp, and script links. For example, 
if an e-mail address that you use throughout your site changes, you can use 
this feature to fix it automatically — a real timesaver. You can use this fea-
ture also when you want a string of text to link to a different file than it 
currently does. For example, you can change every instance of the words 
Enter This Month’s Contest to link to /contest/january.htm instead of 
/contest/december.htm throughout your Web site.
To change a collection of links with the Change Link Sitewide feature, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is displayed in the Files panel.
 
 See the preceding exercise for instructions on selecting a site.
 
2. Choose Site➪Change Link Sitewide.
 
 The Change Link Sitewide dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter the old address and then enter the new address, or click the 
Browse button to identify files where you want to change the links.
 
 You can use this feature to change any link, including e-mail links, links 
from one page to another within a site, or links to a different Web site.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Dreamweaver updates any documents that include the specified links.
 
Any changes you make to links using Dreamweaver’s automated link features 
occur only on the local version of your site on your hard drive. Make sure 
you upload all affected files to your Web server to ensure that all changes are 
included on your published site. To automatically reconcile changes on your 
local and remote sites, use Dreamweaver’s Synchronize Files feature, which I 
describe later in this chapter.
Publishing Your Web Site 
If you’re looking for the section where you find out how to upload your site 
(or any or all of the pages in your site) to your Web server, you’ve found it.
After you create and test your Web site so that it’s ready to publish on the 
Web, you can put Dreamweaver’s publishing tools to work. Which features 

123
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
you use depends on the kind of Web server you use. If you’re using a com-
mercial service provider, you’ll most likely need Dreamweaver’s FTP fea-
tures, which I cover in detail in the following section.
Note that you need the following information from your Web hosting service 
before you can configure Dreamweaver’s FTP features. Most service provid-
ers send this information in an e-mail message when you first sign up for an 
account. If you don’t have this information, you will need to contact your ser-
vice provider for it, because it’s unique to your account on your Web hosting 
service. Here’s what you need:
 
✓ The FTP host name
 
✓ The path to the Web directory (optional but highly recommended. It 
should look similar to this: /web/htdocs/jcwarner)
 
✓ Your FTP login or user name
 
✓ Your FTP password
 
✓ Any special instructions from your server, such as if you need to use 
Passive FTP, or any of the other advanced settings covered in Step 11 in 
the exercise that follows. This varies from server to server, so you need 
to ask your Web hosting service. (If you’re having trouble connecting 
and you’re not sure about these options, you can always experiment by 
checking and unchecking these options to see whether a setting enables 
you to connect.)
Setting up Dreamweaver’s FTP features
After you gather all your FTP information, you’re ready to set up 
Dreamweaver’s FTP publishing features. This process can seem daunting and 
often takes a few tries to get right, but the good news is that you have to do 
it only once. (Dreamweaver saves these settings for you so you don’t have to 
set them up every time you want to upload new pages to your site.)
Follow these steps to set up Dreamweaver’s FTP features and publish files to 
a Web server:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
 
2. In the list of defined sites, select the site you want to publish and then 
click the Edit button.
 
 The Site Setup dialog box opens. If your site is not listed in this dialog, 
that means you haven’t set up your site. Refer to the instructions for this 
important initial site setup process at the beginning of Chapter 2 and 
then return to complete these steps.

124
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
3. Select Servers from the categories listed in the left panel of the Site 
Setup dialog box.
 
 The server list appears. If you haven’t yet set up any Web servers in 
Dreamweaver, this list is blank, as it is in Figure 4-11. Any servers you 
have set up properly are listed in this dialog box.
 
Figure 4-11: 
Click the 
small plus 
sign at the 
bottom of 
the Server 
Setup dialog 
box to open 
the Basic 
server con-
figuration 
dialog box 
where you 
can enter 
your FTP 
information.
 
 
4. Click the small plus sign at the bottom left of the server list area, as 
shown in Figure 4-11.
 
 The Basic category opens in the servers dialog box and FTP is automati-
cally selected, as shown in Figure 4-12. (If you need to use an option 
other than FTP, you find a list explaining all the Dreamweaver options 
under the Technical Stuff icon at the end of these steps.)
 
5. Enter a name in the Server Name field.
 
 You can name your server anything you like. Choose a name that will 
enable you to easily choose among the servers you’ve set up. (If you 
use only one Web server to host your site, the choice doesn’t matter as 
much as it does if you host your site on multiple servers — something 
generally done only by very large or international sites.)
 
6. Enter the FTP address for your Web server account.
 
 Again this information depends on how your Web server is set up, but 
most use one of the following: ftp.servername.com, ftp.your
domainname.com, or simply: yourdomain.com without anything at the 
beginning of the domain. 
 
7. In the Username and Password fields, type your username (sometimes 
called a login name) and password.

125
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
 
 Again, this information is unique to your account on your Web server.
 
8. Check the Save box to the right of the Password field if you want 
Dreamweaver to store your access information.
 
 This is handy because you can then automatically connect to the server 
anytime you want to upload or download pages. However, checking Save 
could enable anyone with access to your computer to gain access to 
your Web server.
 
9. Click the Test button to make sure you’ve entered everything correctly. 
 
 Making a mistake is so easy, so the ability to test the connection and 
make any needed adjustments before you close this dialog is helpful. 
If you connect with no problems, Dreamweaver responds with a box 
saying Dreamweaver connected to your Web server successfully. (Note: 
You must save the password to use the test feature, but you can dese-
lect the Save Password box after you test if you prefer not to save the 
password in the program.)
 
 If you do have trouble connecting to your site, skip ahead to Step 11 for 
a few advanced options that may help.
 
10. In the Root Directory field, type the directory on the remote site in 
which documents visible to the public are stored (also known as the 
local site folder).
 
 The root directory usually looks something like this: public_html/ or 
www/htdocs/. Again, this depends on your server.
 
 If you upload your files to the wrong directory on your server, they 
won’t be visible when you view your site through a browser. The nearby 
sidebar, “Finding the root directory on your Web server,” helps you 
work around this potentially frustrating problem with tips on identifying 
where to upload your Web site after you log into your server and finding 
the root directory to enter in this field if you can’t find it in the informa-
tion you get from your Web hosting company.
 
11. Click the small arrow to the left of More Options.
 
 You may not need to change any of these settings, but if you’re having 
trouble connecting to your server, and you’re sure you’ve entered your 
user name, password, and FTP address correctly, adjusting these set-
tings may enable you to connect.
 
 I recommend checking and unchecking each of these options in turn, 
and then clicking the Test button after each change, to see if any of 
these adjustments makes the difference and enables you to connect to 
your server.
 
 A little experimentation with settings before waiting on hold with tech 
support is usually worth the effort. But if you’re really having trouble 
establishing a connection with your server, call or e-mail the tech support 
staff at your Web server. The only people who can help you are those who 
run your Web server, because the settings are specific to your service 

126
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
provider and can vary dramatically from one hosting company to another. 
I’ve done my best to give you the most common options here, and with a 
little trial and error, the suggestions here should help you connect to 
most Web hosting companies, but if you’re really stuck, it’s okay to ask for 
more help from the people who run your server. 
 
12. After you fill in everything and clicking Test successfully connects to 
your server, click Save to save your settings.
Dreamweaver saves all your FTP settings (assuming you opted to save the 
password). The beauty of all this is that once you enter these settings prop-
erly and know the connection works, you never have to enter them again. 
You can then access your Web server from the Files panel in Dreamweaver, 
as you discover in the exercise that follows.
 
Figure 4-12:

the informa-
tion from 
your Web

company,

box.
 
 
Dreamweaver provides six Access options. If you work at a large company 
or university, you are likely to use one of these options rather than FTP. The 
options available from the Connect Using drop-down list in the Server Setup 
dialog box, are:
 
✓ FTP: Select this option to use Dreamweaver’s built-in File Transfer 
Protocol features, which I cover in detail in the following section. You’re 
most likely to need these settings if you’re using a commercial Web host-
ing service.

127
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
 
✓ SFTP: Provides a more secure FTP connection. If you have the option of 
using a secure connection, it’s definitely the preferred choice, and it’s 
required by some Web servers to maintain higher levels of security.
 
✓ Local/Network: Select this option if you’re using a Web server on a local 
network, such as your company or university server. For specific set-
tings and requirements, check with your system administrator.
 
✓ WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning): Select 
this option if you’re using a server with the WebDAV protocol, such as 
Microsoft IIS.
 
✓ RDS (Rapid Development Services): Select this option if you’re using 
ColdFusion on a remote server.
Finding the root directory on your Web Server
Including the root directory in Dreamweaver’s 
FTP settings is optional, but doing so does 
make transferring files using Dreamweaver’s 
Upload and Download options easier. Thus, you 
reduce your chances of uploading your files to 
the wrong directory on your server, where they 
won’t be visible when you try to view your site 
through a browser. 
To find the root directory and the path to that 
directory on your server, you may need to 
complete the steps in the sections “Setting Up 
Dreamweaver’s FTP Features” and “Publishing 
files to a Web server with FTP.” That’s because 
you may need to log into your Web server and 
do a little experimenting before you can figure 
out exactly what the path to the root directory 
is, but trust me, it’s worth the effort. Here’s why. 
When you log into most commercial Web serv-
ers using the login information they provide you, 
you access your main folder on their server. 
This folder often includes several subfolders, 
such as a folder where your e-mail is stored 
on the server, another folder that stores log 
reports of traffic to your site, and possibly sev-
eral others for things like CGI scripts. Among all 
these subfolders, finding the one in which you 
need to upload your pages can be tricky, but the 
subfolder you need is usually named something 
like htdocs, or web, or webfiles (depend-
ing on what they decided to name it on your 
server). You have to upload your Web pages to 
the right folder so that your Web site becomes 
public on the Internet and your pages are vis-
ible when you open your domain name in a Web 
browser.
If you’re not sure which folder you should use, 
try uploading just one file to any folder that looks 
like a good candidate (using the instructions in 
the “Publishing files to a Web server with FTP” 
section in this chapter). Then visit your domain 
with a Web browser to see if the page is visible 
(remember to click the Refresh button in your 
browser to see any changes each time you try 
uploading another page). After you figure out 
which folder corresponds to your domain name, 
upload all the rest of your site to that same sub-
folder, making sure that you mirror the local 
site folder on your hard drive with the main root 
folder on your server. 
Also note that if you want to use Dreamweaver’s 
synchronization features, also covered in this 
chapter, you need to include the root directory 
in the FTP folder.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Publishing files to a Web server with FTP
You can upload pages to your server and download pages from your server 
using the built-in FTP capabilities of Dreamweaver.
To transfer files between your hard drive and a remote server (after you’ve 
successfully set up the FTP features covered in the previous section of this 
chapter), follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is selected in the Files panel.
 
 
2. In the top left of the Files panel, click the Connects to Remote Host 
icon (this is a tiny icon that looks like a blue electrical cable plugging 
into itself).
 
 If you’re not already connected to the Internet, the Connects to Remote 
Host icon starts your Internet connection. If you have trouble connect-
ing this way, try establishing your Internet connection as you usually do 
to check e-mail or surf the Web, and then return to Dreamweaver and 
click the Connects to Remote Host icon after you’re connected to the 
Internet. When your computer is online, Dreamweaver should have no 
trouble automatically establishing an FTP connection with your host 
server.
 
 If you still have trouble establishing a connection to your Web server, 
refer to the preceding section, “Setting up Dreamweaver’s FTP features,” 
and make sure that you specified the server information correctly.
 
3. After you establish a connection between your computer and your 
Web server, click Expand/Collapse (the tiny icon that looks like a box 
within a box at the far right of the top of the Files panel).
 
 When you click this icon, Dreamweaver displays both the local folder 
with your site on your hard drive and the remote folder with the site on 
your server. I prefer this dual view, because seeing both side by side 
makes moving files from one place to another easier. It also helps me 
visualize the structure of the site on the server.
 
 You can also view your local site folder by choosing Local View from the 
drop-down list at the top right (visible in Figure 4-13). Or choose Remote 
View to see only the files on the server.
 
4. To upload a file (transfer a file from your hard drive to your Web 
server), select the file from the Local View panel (which displays the 
files on your hard drive) and click the Put Files icon (the up arrow) in 
the Files panel.
 
 The files are copied automatically to your server when you transfer 
them. You can select multiple files or folders to be transferred 
simultaneously.

 After you upload files to you server, test your work by using a Web 
browser to view them online. Sometimes things that look and work fine 
on your computer (such as links) won’t work on the server.
 
5. To download files or folders (transfer files or folders from your Web 
server to your hard drive), select the files or folders from the Remote 
View panel (which displays the files on your server) and click the Get 
Files button (the down arrow) in the Files panel.
 
 The files are copied automatically to your hard drive when you transfer 
them.
 
 Be aware that when you copy files to or from your server, the files 
you’re transferring overwrite the files already at the destination. 
Dreamweaver notifies you about the overwriting if it notices you’re 
replacing a newer file with an older one, but it can’t always correctly 
assess the proper time differences. Take note of these warnings, but 
keep in mind that you can get warnings that aren’t always accurate when 
they’re based on the age of a file, especially if you use more than one 
computer to work on your Web site.
 
 When the transfer is complete, you can open the files on your hard 
drive.
 
6. To close this dual-panel dialog and return to Dreamweaver’s main 
workspace, simply click again on the Expand/Collapse icon (the one 
that looks like a box within a box shown in Figure 4-13).

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Downloading an existing Web site
If you want to work on an existing Web site and 
you don’t already have a copy of it on your com-
puter’s hard drive, you can use Dreamweaver 
to download any or all the files in any Web site 
(that you have the login information to access) 
so that you can edit the existing pages, add new 
pages, or use any of Dreamweaver’s other fea-
tures to check links and manage the site’s fur-
ther development. The first step is to get a copy 
of the site onto your computer by downloading 
it from the server.
To download an existing Web site, follow these 
steps:
 1. Create a new folder on your computer to 
store the existing site.
 2. Specify this folder as the local site folder 
for the site with Dreamweaver’s site setup 
features.
 
 Follow the instructions at the beginning of 
Chapter 2 to set up a site, if you’re not sure 
how to do this yet.
 3. Enter the FTP settings in the Basic server 
dialog box (refer to Figure 4-12).
 
 I explain how to do this in this chapter, in 
the “Setting up Dreamweaver’s FTP fea-
tures” section.
 4. Connect to the remote site by clicking 
the tiny Connects to Remote Host button, 
which looks like the ends of two cables, in 
the Files panel.
 5. Click the Get Files button, which looks like 
a down arrow, to download the entire site 
to your local drive.
 
 Sometimes your Web host has files on the 
remote server that you don’t need to down-
load. If you want to download only specific 
files or folders from the site, select only 
those files or folders in the Remote Site 
pane of the Files panel and click the Get 
Files button. (See the sidebar “Finding the 
root directory on your Web server” to find 
the folder on your Web server that corre-
sponds to the local site folder on your hard 
drive. Re-creating the folder structure on 
your local computer is important because 
Dreamweaver needs to know the relative 
location of all the files in your site in order 
to set links properly. The safest option is to 
download the entire site; but if you’re work-
ing on a large Web project, downloading a 
part of the structure will enable you to work 
on a section of the site without download-
ing it all.
 
 If you’re working on only one page or sec-
tion of a site, I recommend you choose to 
include dependent files, meaning any files 
linked from those pages, as you download 
them to ensure that the links are set prop-
erly when you make changes and that all 
related files are downloaded to your hard 
drive.
 6. After you download the site or specific 
files or folders, you can edit them as you 
do any other file in Dreamweaver.

131
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
Synchronizing local and remote sites
One of the most valuable features in Dreamweaver’s FTP options is the capa-
bility to automatically synchronize the files on your hard drive with the files 
on your server. This is cool because it helps you keep track of which pages 
you’ve edited and ensures that they’ve been updated on the server. This may 
not matter much to you the first time you upload your site, or if you have 
only a few pages in your site. But if you have a large site and make frequent 
updates, this feature is a wonderful way to make sure you upload all the 
changes you make to your server. Dreamweaver also confirms which files are 
updated after you complete the synchronization.
Follow these steps to synchronize your Web site:
 
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is selected and displayed in 
the Files panel.
 
 
2. Click the Connects to Remote Host icon, in the top left of the Files 
panel, to log on to your remote site.
 
 
3. Click the Expand/Collapse icon (labeled in Figure 4-13) to expand the 
dialog box and view the remote and local sites simultaneously.
 
 The Site dialog box displays both the remote and local views of the site. 
(To collapse this dialog box, click the Expand/Collapse icon again.)
 
4. Choose Site➪Synchronize.
 
 The Synchronize Files dialog box appears.
 
5. In the Synchronize drop-down list, choose whether to synchronize the 
Entire Site or Selected Files Only.
 
6. In the Direction drop-down list, choose which option you want to use 
to copy the files:
 
• Put Newer Files to Remote: This option copies the most recently 
modified files from your local site to the remote site. Click the 
Delete Remote Files Not on Local Drive box if you want those files 
removed from your Web site.
 
• Get Newer Files from Remote: This option copies the most 
recently modified files from your remote site to the local site. Click 
the Delete Local Files Not on Remote Server box if you want to 
remove those files from your local copy.
 
• Get and Put Newer Files: This option updates both the local and 
remote sites with the most recent versions of all the files.

132
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 Make sure the Delete Remote Files Not on Local Drive box is not 
selected. Be careful of this feature when using Get or Put. As a general 
rule, I recommend you leave it deselected because you may have folders 
and files on the server, such as log files, that don’t exist on your hard 
drive, and you don’t want to delete them inadvertently.
 
7. Click the Preview button.
 
 The Site FTP dialog box displays the files that are about to be changed.
 
 Now you have the option to verify the files you want to delete, put, and 
get. If you don’t want Dreamweaver to alter a file, deselect it from the 
Site FTP dialog box now or forever live with the consequences.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 All approved changes are automatically made, and Dreamweaver 
updates the Site FTP dialog box with the status.
 
9. When the synchronization finishes, you can choose to save or not save 
the verification information to a local file.
 
 I recommend that you save the verification information because it can 
be handy if you want to review your changes after synchronization is 
complete.
Using a dedicated FTP program
If you prefer to use a dedicated FTP program 
instead of Dreamweaver’s built-in features, you 
can download FTP programs for the Mac and 
PC at the following Web addresses:
 ✓ http://fireftp.mozdev.org/: 
Fire FTP is a nifty little FTP program is an 
add-on to Firefox and a great alternative 
to Dreamweaver’s FTP features. Ideal for 
fixing things when you’re on the road and 
don’t have Dreamweaver handy, or just 
want to view the files on your server with-
out using Dreamweaver, this program can 
be added to any version of Firefox (for free).
 ✓ http://filezilla-project.org: 
A popular open source option that works on 
computers running the Windows, Mac, and 
Linux operating systems.
 ✓ www.ipswitch.com: A popular FTP 
program for the PC, WS_FTP is such a 
sophisticated FTP program many Web 
designers are willing to pay the cost of this 
program, which offers a free trial version 
you can use to try it out.
 ✓ www.cuteftp.com: A popular Windows 
program, CuteFTP, can be downloaded 
from the Web site.
 ✓ www.fetchsoftworks.com and 
www.panic.com/transmit: If you 
use a Macintosh computer, popular options 
are Fetch, available for download at the 
former Web address and Transmit, avail-
able for download at the latter address.

 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
Setting cloaking options
The Dreamweaver Cloaking option enables you to exclude folders or files 
from the site publishing features, meaning they won’t be uploaded to the live 
site when you’re synchronizing or uploading a batch of files to the server. If 
you’re wondering why you might want to prevent files from uploading to your 
Web server, consider this: The Cloaking feature is a handy way to prevent 
large graphics, such as Photoshop files, from being uploaded and taking up 
room on your server, while still storing your high-resolution graphics in your 
local site folder so you can easily keep track of them. This is useful, for exam-
ple, if you have a layered .psd or .tiff file that you want to store near the 
optimized JPEG versions you use in your site. (You find information about 
converting images into JPEG and other Web-friendly formats in Chapter 3.)
You can use the Cloaking feature to save any type of files in your local site 
folder, with the assurance that no one can accidentally publish the files with 
Dreamweaver until you uncloak them and publish them. This feature is best 
used for large files you don’t want on your Web server, such as .psd, .tiff, 
.avi, and other high-resolution image or video formats.
To use the Cloaking feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
2. Select the name of the site you want to work on and then click Edit.
 
 The Site Setup dialog box opens and displays the site.
 
3. Click the small arrow next to Advanced Settings in the left panel, and 
then click the Cloaking tab.
 
 The Cloaking options are displayed in the main area of the dialog box.
 
4. Click to Select the Enable Cloaking check box.
 
 The cloaking options become active.
 
5. Click to select the Cloak Files Ending With check box.
 
6. Enter the extension(s) of any file types you want to cloak in the text 
field, as shown in Figure 4-14.
 
 For example, if you want to cloak any original Photoshop files that may 
be saved in your local site folder so they don’t upload and take up space 
on your server, enter the .psd extension. If you want to cloak more than 
one file type, separate each file extension with a space. Do not use a 
comma or other delimiter.

7. Click Save to close the Site Setup dialog box.
 
 Files matching the extensions specified, if any, are now cloaked and will 
not be uploaded to your Web server even if you upload the folder that 
contains those files to the server.
 
 To uncloak files, repeat Steps 1–6 and delete the corresponding file 
extensions in the Cloaking text field. 
Enabling Adobe Contribute
Adobe Contribute is a program that was cre-
ated so that people who don’t know much about 
Web design can easily contribute to a Web site. 
Think of Contribute as sort of a Dreamweaver 
Light, except it doesn’t work very well as a 
standalone program. Contribute was designed 
to work on sites designed in Dreamweaver, 
and a number of features have been carefully 
integrated to make that collaboration work 
smoothly. 
Using Dreamweaver’s .dwt template features 
you can designate areas of each page that can 
be edited by users of Contribute. In this way, 
you can protect common elements, such as 
logos and navigation links, while making it easy 
for contributors to edit text and images in des-
ignated areas of each page.
If you’re working with other developers of a site 
who use Contribute, make sure you select the 
Enable Contribute Compatibility check box in 
the Contribute category of the Site Setup dialog 
box, as shown in this figure.

 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
Using Design Notes to Keep in Touch
If you sometimes forget the details of your work or neglect to tell your col-
leagues important things about the Web site you’re all working on, the 
Dreamweaver Design Notes feature may save you some grief. If you’re the 
only person working on a Web site, you probably don’t need the features 
described in this section because they are intended for use on sites devel-
oped by a team of people who need to communicate with each other and 
make sure they don’t overwrite each other’s work.
Design Notes are ideal if you want to hide sensitive information from visitors, 
such as pricing structures or creative strategies, but make it available to 
members of your development team. Information saved as a Design Note in 
Dreamweaver can travel with any HTML file or image, even if the file transfers 
from one Web site to another or from Fireworks to Dreamweaver.
Essentially, Design Notes enable you to record information (such as a mes-
sage to another designer on your team) and associate it with a file or folder. 
Design Notes work a lot like the comment tag (HTML code that enables you 
to embed in a page text that won’t appear in a browser) but with a bit more 
privacy. Unlike the comment tag, which is embedded directly in the HTML 
code of a page (and can be seen if someone views the source code behind a 
page on the Web), Design Notes are never visible to your visitors. The only 
way for a visitor to view Design Notes is to deliberately type the path to your 
notes subdirectory and view the notes files directly. You can even explicitly 
block this from being allowed, but only if you have administrative access to 
your server. To be even more secure, you can keep the notes on your hard 
drive and prevent them from ever being uploaded to your server — though, 
of course, your team members won’t see your witty remarks.
To access the Design Notes page, choose Design Notes in the Category list in 
the Site Setup dialog box (see Figure 4-15). The settings on this page enable 
you to control how Dreamweaver uses Design Notes:
 
✓ Maintain Design Notes: Select this option to ensure that the Design Note 
remains attached to the file when you upload, copy, or move it.
 
✓ Upload Design Notes for Sharing: Choose this option to include Design 
Notes when you send files to the server via FTP.
 
✓ Clean Up: Use the Clean Up button, also shown in Figure 4-15, to delete 
any Design Notes that are not associated with any files in the site.

136

When you create graphics in Adobe Fireworks, you can save a Design Note 
for each image file that is also available in Dreamweaver. To use this inte-
grated feature, create a Design Note in Fireworks and associate it with the 
image. Then when you save the Fireworks image to your local Web site 
folder, the Design Note goes with it. When you open the file in Dreamweaver, 
the Design Note appears when you right-click the image (Control+click on the 
Mac). This feature is a great way for graphic designers to communicate with 
other members of the Web development team.
To activate the Design Notes feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
 
2. Select the site you want to work on and then click the Edit button.
 
 The Site Setup dialog box opens.
 
3. Select the Advanced tab.
 
4. In the Category list at the left, choose Design Notes.
 
 The Design Notes page appears (refer to Figure 4-15).
 
5. Select the Maintain Design Notes option.
 
 With this option selected, whenever you copy, move, rename, or delete 
a file, the associated Design Notes file is also copied, moved, renamed, 
or deleted with it.
 
6. If you want your Design Notes to be sent with your files when they are 
uploaded to your server, select the Upload Design Notes for Sharing 
option.
 
 If you’re making notes only to yourself and don’t want them to be associ-
ated with the page when you upload it to the server, deselect this option 

137
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Web Site
and the Design Notes will be maintained locally but not uploaded with 
your file.
 
7. Click OK in the Site Setup dialog box and then click the Done button 
in the Manage Sites dialog box.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box closes.
To add Design Notes to a document, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the file you want to add a Design Note to and then choose 
File➪Design Notes.
 
 The Design Notes dialog box opens. You need to have a file checked out 
to add or modify a Design Note, but not to read a note.
 
2. In the Status drop-down list box, choose the status of the document.
 
 Your options are Draft, Revision 1, Revision 2, Revision 3, Alpha, Beta, 
Final, and Needs Attention. You can choose any status, and you should 
set a policy with your design team about what each status means and 
how you use these options to manage your development.
 
3. In the Notes text box, type your comments.
 
4. If you want to insert the current local date, click the Insert Date icon, 
which is just above the Notes text box.
 
 The current date is inserted automatically.
 
 You can also select the Show When File Is Open check box. If this box is 
selected, the Design Notes appear whenever the file is opened so that 
they can’t be missed.
 
5. Click the All Info tab.
 
 You can add other information that may be useful to developers of your 
site. For example, you can name a key designer (in the Name field) and 
define the value as the name of that person or the priority of the project 
(in the Value field). You may also define a field for a client or the type of 
file that you commonly use.
 
6. Click the plus (+) button to add a new information item; click the 
minus (–) button to remove a selected item.
 
7. Click OK to save the notes.
 
 The notes you entered are saved to a subfolder named notes in the same 
location as the current file. The filename is the document’s filename 
plus the extension .mno. For example, if the filename is art.htm, the 
associated Design Notes file is named art.htm.mno. Design Notes are 
indicated in Site View by a small yellow icon that looks like a cartoon 
bubble.

Part II
Appreciating Web 
Design Options

In this part . . .
T
he best way to design Web sites today is with 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This part introduces 
you to the power and advantages of CSS, with two chap-
ters on creating and using styles.
In Chapter 5, you find an introduction to CSS and a review 
of the CSS features in Dreamweaver. In Chapter 6, you 
move on to creating CSS layouts, using <div> tags and 
other block-level elements to create accessible, flexible 
designs.
In Chapter 7, you discover how the Dreamweaver tem-
plates can make creating Web pages faster, and best of all, 
how templates can save you time when you want to make 
changes to your page designs. In Chapter 8, you find out 
how to create tables, split and merge cells, and use table 
attributes. You also find tips about when to use tables and 
when CSS is the preferred option.

Chapter 5
Cascading Style Sheets
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing CSS
▶ Looking at CSS rule options
▶ Working in the CSS Styles panel
▶ Comparing internal and external style sheets
W
ant to add a little style to your pages? Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
are all the rave on the Web, and with good reason: CSS is the way to 
create Web sites today if you want to follow the latest standards and develop 
sites that are accessible, flexible, and designed to work on a wide range of 
screen sizes and devices.
Unfortunately, most people find working with styles far more complicated 
and confusing than other approaches to design. In my experience, this con-
fusion fades after you learn the basics and start working with styles. This 
chapter is designed to introduce you to how styles work, the different kinds 
of styles (and what they’re best used for), and how to use the features in 
Dreamweaver that are designed for creating and editing CSS.
The concept of creating styles has been around since long before the Web. 
Desktop publishing programs, such as Adobe InDesign, and even word pro-
cessing programs, such as Microsoft Word, have long used styles to manage 
the formatting and editing of text on printed pages. Using styles in a word pro-
cessor, you can create and save styles for common features, such as headlines 
and captions. In print design, styles are great timesavers because they enable 
you to combine a collection of formatting options, such as Arial, bold, and 
italic, into one style and then apply all those options at once to any selected 
text in your document using a single style. You also have the advantage that 
if you change a style, you can apply the change automatically — everywhere 
you’ve used that style in a document.
On the Web, you can do all that and more with CSS because you can use style 
sheets for more than just text formatting. For example, you can use CSS to 
create styles that align images to the left or right side of a page, add padding 
around text or images, and change background and link colors. For all these 

142
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
reasons (and more), CSS has quickly become the preferred method of design-
ing Web pages among professional Web designers. If you haven’t jumped on 
the CSS bandwagon yet, this chapter is designed to help you understand the 
basics of CSS.
If you have been working with CSS for a while, you may appreciate this 
review of CSS and an introduction to Dreamweaver’s style features. 
In this chapter, you learn the basics of CSS, including how best to use the differ-
ent types of style selectors and when to use external versus internal style sheets. 
Chapter 6 builds on the topics in this chapter, showing you how to design 
page layouts by combining <div> and other XHTML tags with styles. You 
also find instructions for creating class styles, tag styles, and compound 
styles, which enable you to create styles that apply only to specific sections 
of a page. To give you a head start on your designs, I also include instruc-
tions for customizing the predesigned CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver 
in Chapter 6.
Introducing Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is a powerful tool because you can use it to make global style changes 
across an entire Web site. Suppose, for example, that you create a style for 
your headlines by redefining the <h1> tag to create large, blue, bold head-
lines. Then one fine day, you decide that all your headlines should be red 
instead of blue. If you aren’t using CSS, changing all your headlines could be a 
huge undertaking — a matter of opening every Web page in your site to make 
changes to the font tags around your headlines. But if you’re using CSS in an 
external style sheet, you can simply change the style that controls the head-
line in the style sheet, and voilá! Your headlines all turn red automatically. 
 
If you ever have to redesign your site (and believe me, every good site goes 
through periodic redesigns), you can save hours or even days of work if 
you’ve created your design with CSS.
Understanding the basics of styles
Many people find CSS confusing at first because it’s such a different approach 
to design than what you may be used to if you’ve worked in print. The follow-
ing are three of the more confusing aspects of CSS for beginners:
 
✓ Getting used to thinking about the styles on your site separate from 
your text, images, and other content: For example, you want to avoid 
simply applying formatting directly to a heading to make it bold, green, 
and 24 point. In CSS, you create a style for your heading that includes 

143
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
bold, green, and 24 point; save that style in a separate place in your 
document or in a separate file called an external style sheets; and then 
apply the style to the heading text. As a result, if you want to change the 
way your headline looks later, you don’t go to the headline text in your 
page to make the change. Instead, you edit the style in the style sheet, 
and it automatically changes any heading text formatted with that style.
 
✓ Understanding all the different kinds of style selectors you can choose 
from, such as class, ID, and tag selectors: No matter how you create your 
styles, each style definition, or rule, contains a selector and a declara-
tion. The selector identifies the name and type of style — #container or 
.caption for example. The declaration defines the style and describes 
its properties, such as bold, blue, or 300 pixels wide. If that doesn’t mean 
much to you yet, don’t worry. Dreamweaver’s four selector types are 
described in detail later in this chapter, and as you discover how styles 
work, new terms like selectors and declarations begin to make a lot more 
sense.
 
✓ Understanding when it’s best to create external style sheets, internal 
style sheets, or inline styles: The section “Using Internal versus External 
Style Sheets” explains how to use the different types of style sheets.
 
✓ Understanding how you combine CSS and XHTML to create Web 
pages: For example, you can control the size and positioning of a <div> 
tag by applying an ID style to the tag, or you can redefine a tag, such as 
the <h1> tag to change the way headlines look on a page.
If you’re starting to feel baffled already, hang in there. I’m just trying to give 
you an overview as I take you further and further down the rabbit hole. Keep 
reading through the basic concepts covered in the sections that follow and 
then continue to the step-by-step instructions in this and the next chapter 
(even if you’re not quite sure you understand everything yet). 
Combining CSS and XHTML
Most professional Web designers today recommend creating Web page 
designs by combing XHTML (a stricter version of HTML) and CSS. Here’s the 
simplified version of how the two work together:
 
1. Use XHTML to create the structure of a page with tags, such as division 
(<div>), heading (<h1>, <h2>, and so on), and paragraph (<p>).
 
2. Create styles in CSS that specify the size of these elements, where they 
appear on a page, and a variety of other formatting options.
Similarly, you use XHTML to insert images and create links, and then add 
styles to change formatting options, such as removing the underline from 
your links or changing the color that appears when someone rolls a cursor 
over a link.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Understanding style selectors
When you create new styles, you need to understand which selector to use 
for which job. The selector determines the kind of style you will create. Each 
selector option has different naming restrictions and purposes. If you’re 
completely new to working with styles, this may not make much sense yet, 
but this is a fundamental part of working with styles. I encourage you to 
read through all these descriptions of selectors so you can appreciate your 
options before you move on.
 
Don’t feel you have to memorize all this. Instead, consider folding down the 
corner on this page so you can refer to this list of selectors as you create and 
edit styles later.
The following sections offer descriptions of each of the four selection types, 
which are available from the New CSS Rules dialog box (as shown in Figure 5-1) 
when you create.
Class selectors
The class selector is the most versatile selector option. Class styles can 
format any element (from text to images to multimedia), and you can use 
them as many times as you like on any page in a Web site.
Class style names always begin with a period, and you can create class 
styles with any name as long as you don’t use spaces or special characters. 
(Hyphens and dashes are okay.) Thus, you could create a style called caption 
for the text that appears under your pictures.
.caption
Dreamweaver helps you with the opening period (or a dot). If you choose 
class as the selector type and forget to include a dot at the beginning of the 
name, Dreamweaver adds one for you. Just don’t include any space between 
the dot and the style name.
However, the dot appears only in your style sheet code. When you apply a 
class style to text or another element, the dot doesn’t appear in the name in 
your XHTML code. Thus, if you applied the .caption style to a paragraph 
tag to format the text under an image, the XHTML code would look like this:
<p class=”caption”>This is a photo of a family of Fallow 
deer was taken in Northern California.</p>
 
Class styles must be applied to an element, such as the paragraph tag shown 
in this example. Class tags can even be added to elements that other styles 
already define.

145
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
When you create a class style in Dreamweaver, the style is displayed in the 
CSS Styles panel on the right side of the workspace (shown in Figure 5-1). 
You can apply class styles by using the CSS drop-down list, also shown in 
Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1:

able from 
the CSS 
drop-down 
list and can

to any 
element 
and used 
as many 
times as you 
like on any 
page.
 
For more details and step-by-step instructions for creating and applying 
styles with class selectors, see Chapter 6.
ID selectors
Think of ID styles as the building blocks of most CSS page layouts. What’s 
special about ID styles is that they must be unique. Each ID style can be used 
only once per page. This makes them ideally suited to formatting <div> tags 
and other block-level elements that are used to create distinct sections, like a 
sidebar or the header or footer. You can create as many ID styles as you want 
for each page, but you can only use each one once in each page design.
ID styles must begin with a pound (#) character. Similar to class styles, 
Dreamweaver adds # to the beginning of the style name automatically if you 
forget to include it. And, like with a class style, don’t include a space between 
# and the style name.

146
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
The ID selector option was a new addition to the CSS Rule dialog box in 
Dreamweaver CS4 and remains this way in version CS5. In version CS3, you 
had to choose the Advanced option to create an ID style. 
Similar to class styles, you can name ID styles anything you like as long as 
you don’t use spaces or special characters (again hyphens and underscores 
are okay). An ID style used to identify the sidebar section of a page could 
look like this:
#sidebar
Similar to class styles, # isn’t used in the XHTML code. When a style is 
applied to an element, such as a <div> tag, the XHTML code looks like this:
<div id=”sidebar”>Between these tags with the sidebar ID 
style, you would include any headlines, text, 
or other elements in your sidebar.</div>
In the predesigned CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver, all the designs are 
created by combining a series of <div> tags with ID styles using names like 
#container, #header, and #footer to identify the main sections of the 
design. In Figure 5-2, you can see how a collection of ID and compound styles 
are displayed in the CSS Styles panel. 
 
Figure 5-2: 
Styles 
created 
with the ID 
selector 
should only 
be used only 
once per

Tag selectors
The tag selector is used to redefine existing XHTML tags. Select this option 
if you want to change the appearance of an existing XHTML tag, such as the 
<h1> (heading 1) tag or the <ul> (unordered list) tag.

147
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
In many cases, redefining existing XHTML tags with your desired formatting 
using CSS has advantages over creating new styles. For example, content 
formatted with the heading 1 tag is well recognized on the Web as the most 
important text on a page. For that reason, many search engines give priority 
to text formatted with the heading 1 tag. Similarly, the hierarchical struc-
ture of the <h1>–<h6> tags helps ensure that, even if a visitor to your site 
changes the text size in his Web browser, text formatted with the heading 
1 tag is still larger relative to text formatted with an heading 2 tag, which is 
larger than text formatted with the heading 3 tag, and so on.
When you use the tag selector, the style definition is applied automatically to 
any text or other element that’s been formatted with the corresponding tag. 
Thus, if you’ve formatted a heading with an <h1> tag and then create a new 
<h1> style, the formatting you used to define the style will apply automati-
cally to the heading as soon as the style is created.
When you choose the tag selector type, all the XHTML tags become visible in 
a drop-down list in the New CSS Rule dialog box. You simply choose the tag 
style you want to create, as shown in Figure 5-3, where I’ve selected h1.

the appear-
ance of any

148
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Creating compound styles
The compound selector can be used to combine two or more style rules to 
create a style definition that displays only when one style is contained within 
another. Compound styles are useful when you want to do something like 
use the heading 1 tag multiple times to format headlines in different ways on 
the same Web page. For example, you could create one style for headlines 
that appear in the main story area of a page and then create another style for 
headlines that appear in the sidebar on the page and still use the heading 1 
tag to format both.
Compound styles are created by combining ID, class, or tag styles and look 
like this:
#sidebar h1
See Figure 5-4 for an example of how an <h1> style defined like this within 
a #sidebar ID style looks in the New CSS Rule dialog box. For a compound 
style, you must 
 
✓ Include a space between each name or tag in a compound style.
 
✓ Leave off the brackets around tag in a style name. 
In this example, the style definition will apply only to <h1> tags that appear 
within another element, such as a <div> tag with an ID style #sidebar.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Use the 
compound 
style 
selector to 
combine 
styles.
 
If a compound style combines more than one tag, it’s written like this:
#sidebar h1 a:link

149
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
Again, you must include a space between each name or tag. In this example, 
you see a style that defines the appearance of the active link tag only when 
the link is located inside an element formatted with the <h1> tag that’s also 
inside an element formatted with the #sidebar ID. A compound style like 
this enables you to create links in a sidebar headline that look different than 
links in another part of the sidebar.
After you figure out the differences among these style selector options and 
when they’re best used, you’re well on your way to mastering the art of creat-
ing and applying styles in Dreamweaver, which is covered in Chapter 6.
Using internal versus external style sheets
In CSS, you have the option of creating internal, external, or inline styles. You 
can even use a combination of these options, or attach multiple external style 
sheets to the same Web page. Here’s an explanation of these options:
 
✓ Internal styles: If you create internal styles, the CSS code is stored in the 
<head> area at the top of the XHTML page, and you can apply the styles 
only that page. If you’re just creating a one-page Web site or styles used 
on only one page, an internal style sheet is fine, but for most sites, exter-
nal style sheets offer many advantages.
 
✓ External styles: If you save your styles in an external style sheet, they’re 
stored in a separate file with a .css extension. You can attach external 
style sheets to any or all of the pages in a Web site in much the same 
way that you can insert the same image into multiple pages. You can 
also attach multiple external style sheets to the same page. For example, 
you can create one style sheet for styles that format text and another 
for layout styles. You can also create external style sheets for different 
purposes, such as one for print and one for screen display. For a Web 
designer, external style sheets offer two big advantages: They enable 
you to create new pages faster and more easily and to update styles 
across many pages at once.
 
✓ Inline styles: Inline styles are created within a document at the place 
that a style is used and only apply to the element to which they’re 
attached in the document. Inline styles are generally considered the 
least useful of the three style sheet options, because to change the 
defined style, you must change the code that contains the element, 
which means you lose the benefits of making global updates and creat-
ing clean, fast-loading code. For example, creating one style for all your 
headlines and saving it in an external style sheet is more efficient than 
applying the style formatting options to each headline separately.

150
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
At the bottom of the New CSS Rule dialog box, shown in Figure 5-5, you find 
a Rule Definition drop-down list. Use this list to specify where and how you 
want to save each new style that you define. The options are
 
✓ This Document Only: Create an internal style for the open document 
only.
 
✓ New Style Sheet file: Create the new style in an external style sheet and 
create a new external style sheet simultaneously.
 
✓ An existing external style sheet: Choose any existing external style 
sheet attached to the page by selecting the name of the style sheet from 
the Rule Definition drop-down list. In Figure 5-5, I am selecting an exist-
ing style sheet with the name slides.css.
 
If you’re creating a style that you’re likely to use on more than one page in 
your site, saving the style to a new or existing external style sheet is your best 
choice. If you save a style in an internal style sheet and later want to add it to 
an external style sheet, you can move the style by clicking and dragging the 
style into the external style sheet list in the CSS Styles panel.

Looking at the code behind the scenes
Even if you prefer not to look the code behind your Web pages, it’s helpful to 
have at least some familiarity with different kinds of tags, CSS, and other code 
that Dreamweaver creates for you when you design Web pages. The follow-
ing examples show what the CSS code in an internal or external style sheet 
would look like in Dreamweaver for the following styles:
 
✓ An ID style that’s created with the ID selector, named #container, and 
defined as 780 pixels wide with the left and right margins set to auto (a 
cool trick for centering a CSS design, covered in Chapter 6).
 
✓ A style that’s created with a class selector, named .caption, and 
defined as Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans serif, small, italic, and bold.

151
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
✓ A style created with a tag selector to redefine the HTML tag <h1> as 
follows: Arial, Helvetica, sans serif, large, and bold. (Note: Because 
the heading tags already include bold formatting, it’s not necessary to 
include bold in the style definition.)
#container {
 
width: 780px;
 
margin-right: auto;
 
margin-left: auto;
}
.caption {
 
font-family:  Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-
serif;
 
font-size: small;
 
font-style: italic;
 
font-weight: bold;
}
H1 {
 
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
 
font-size: large;
}
Comparing CSS Rule Options
After you determine what selector type is best for your style — and decide 
whether you want to save it in an external or internal style — you’re done 
with the New CSS Rules dialog box (described in the previous sections). You 
are ready to move on to the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and define the 
formatting and other options you want to include in your style. You find step-
by-step instructions for creating new style rules later in this chapter. This 
section continues the overview to help you better understand your choices 
before you start creating a new style. 
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box includes eight different categories, each 
with multiple options. All these choices can seem a bit daunting at first, 
which is why I’ve included in this section a general overview of the options in 
each category. Again, don’t feel you have to memorize all these options; you 
can always refer to this section when you’re creating new styles.
Before you get overwhelmed by all the options, here’s a tip. You don’t have 
to specify any of the settings in the dialog boxes that follow when you create 
a new style in Dreamweaver. When you leave an option blank, you let the 
default browser settings (or other styles) already applied to the page take 
control. For example, if you don’t specify a text color in a class style named 
.caption, the text formatted with the style remains black — the default 

152
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
color in most Web browsers, unless another style contains formatting 
instructions for the color of that text. (You find instructions for changing the 
text color for an entire page in Chapter 6.)
In most cases, you select only a few options from one or two categories for 
each new style you create. I’ve included the full list here so you can appreci-
ate all the options. 
 
Not all the options in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box are supported by all 
the Web browsers in use on the Web today; the way styles are displayed on 
a Web page can vary depending on the browser. Similarly, some CSS options 
aren’t included in Dreamweaver because they’re not commonly supported. 
The following section describes the options in each of the categories offered 
in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box (shown in Figures 5-6 through 5-14).
The Type category
The Type category features a collection of options that control the display of 
(you guessed it) the text in your pages. With the Type category selected (see 
Figure 5-6), you have the following formatting options:
 
✓ Font-Family: Specifies a font, a font family, or a series of families. You 
can add fonts to the list by choosing Edit Font List in the drop-down list. 
(For an explanation of why Dreamweaver includes font collections — 
and a look at how to create new ones — see the upcoming section, “Why 
so many fonts?”)
 
Figure 5-6: 
The Type 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 

153
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
✓ Font-Size: Defines the size of the text. You can choose a specific numeric 
size or a relative size. Use the drop-down arrow to select from a list of 
options that includes pixels, picas, and percentages. (For more on these 
options, see the sidebar “Understanding CSS size options.”)
 
✓ Font-Style: Enables you to choose whether the text appears as normal, 
italic, or oblique. (Italic and oblique are rarely different in a Web 
browser, so stick with italic unless you have a specific reason not to.)
 
✓ Line-Height: Enables you to specify the height of a line on which the text 
is placed (graphic designers usually call this leading). You can specify 
line-height in a variety of ways, including pixels, picas, and percentages. 
(For more on these options, see the upcoming section, “Understanding 
CSS size options.”)
 
✓ Text-Decoration: Enables you to specify whether text is underlined, 
overlined (a line appears over the text), displayed with a strikethrough, 
or displayed with the blink effect (which makes text appear to flash 
on and off). You can also choose None, which removes all decorative 
effects.
 
 None is the option that removes the underline from linked text. And 
please, use the other decoration options sparingly, if at all. Links are 
underlined automatically; if you underline text that isn’t a link, you risk 
confusing viewers. Overlined and strikethrough text can be hard to read. 
Use these options only if they enhance your design. And by all means, 
resist the blink effect; it’s distracting and can make the screen difficult 
to read.
 
✓ Font-Weight: Enables you to control how bold the text appears by using 
a specific or relative boldness option.
 
✓ Font-Variant: Enables you to select small caps. Unfortunately, this attri-
bute isn’t supported by most browsers.
 
✓ Font-Transform: Enables you to globally change the case of selected 
words, making them all uppercase, all lowercase, with initial caps, or 
with no capitalization.
 
✓ Color: Defines the color of the text. You can use the color well (the 
square icon) to open a Web-safe color palette in which you can select 
predefined colors or create custom colors.
After you select the Type options for your style sheet, click Apply to apply 
them, and click OK to save the settings and close the CSS Rule Definition 
dialog box.

154
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Why so many fonts?
Although you can specify any font you want for text on your Web pages, 
you don’t have complete control over how that font appears on your visi-
tor’s computer because the font you apply is displayed properly only if your 
visitors have the same font on their hard drives. To help ensure that your 
text appears as you intend, Dreamweaver includes collections of the most 
common fonts on Windows and Macintosh computers, grouped together in 
families, such as 
 
✓ Arial, Helvetica, sans serif
 
✓ Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, and serif
When you apply a collection of fonts, the browser displays the formatted text 
in the first font available in the list. For example, if you choose the font col-
lection that starts with Georgia and your visitors have Georgia on their hard 
drives, they see your text in Georgia. If they don’t have Georgia, the text is 
displayed in the next font on the list that your visitors do have — in this case, 
Times New Roman. If they don’t have that font either, the text is displayed in 
Times. And if they don’t even have Times (which would be very unusual), the 
browser looks for any serif font. (In case you’re not familiar with font terms, 
serif describes fonts, such as Times, that have those little curly things on the 
edges of letters; sans serif means no curly things, which is what you get with 
a font like Arial.)
You can create your own font collections by selecting the Edit Font List 
option from the bottom of the Font-Family drop-down list in the Property 
inspector or the Type category of the CSS Rule Definition dialog box. In the 
Edit Font List dialog box, shown in Figure 5-7, you can do the following:
 
✓ To add or remove a font collection, use the plus and minus buttons at 
the top of the Edit Font List dialog box. 
 
✓ To add individual fonts to a collection, select the font name from the 
bottom right of the dialog box and use the double-left arrows to add it to 
a font list. 
 
✓ To remove a font from a collection, use the double-right arrows.)
The only way to ensure that text appears in the font you want is to create 
the text in a graphic in a program, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, and then 
insert the graphic with the text into your page. That’s not a bad option for 
special text, such as banners or logos; but it’s usually not a good option for 
all your text because graphics take longer to download than text and are 
harder to update later.

Understanding CSS size options
With CSS, you can specify sizes for fonts and other elements in so many ways 
that confusion can set in. If you’re familiar with print, you’ll probably recog-
nize point sizes and pixel sizes, but these aren’t necessarily the best options 
when you’re designing for the Internet. On the Web, where display windows 
can vary from giant monitors to tiny cell-phone screens, using relative sizes 
can help you create more flexible and adaptable deigns, something you can’t 
do as well with fixed pixel or point sizes. As you work in Dreamweaver to 
create Web pages, be sure to get familiar with the following sizing options:
 
✓ Small, medium, and large relative sizes: Many Web designers prefer to 
use relative sizes, such as the small, medium, and large. The advantage 
of this method is that the font size adjusts in response to your visitor’s 
settings while maintaining its relative relationship. If text is formatted as 
large (for example), it appears on-screen as larger than text formatted as 
small — no matter what the default font size. Thus, you can maintain the 
hierarchy of text elements on a page, even if your user alters the default 
text size (an option available to users in most Web browsers).
 
✓ Percent-based relative sizes: A variation on the small-medium-large 
approach is to specify a page-wide base font size as medium (which is 
the default in most browsers), and then use percentages to make text 
larger or smaller, relative to that base size. For example, you could 
define the text in a caption style as 90 percent and your caption text 
would appear at 90 percent of the size of the rest of the text on the page. 
You could then make headlines 150 percent (for example) and subheads 
125 percent.
 
✓ Em and ex: Another size option is em, which refers to the space taken 
up by a capital letter M in the font face specified in a style. The ex option 
is similar, but it’s based on the size of a lowercase x in the specified font 
face. Although these two options may seem complex (especially when 
you’re new to Web design), these two sizes are popular for line spacing, 
as well as for other settings; that’s because the size is adjusted relative 
to the displayed text size. Although this can get confusing, em and ex 
work much like percentages — and adapt even better to different user 
settings and monitor sizes.

156
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
The Background category
Using the Background category in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box (see 
Figure 5-8), you can specify a background color or image for a style — and 
control how the background is displayed on the page. You can use back-
ground style settings for any element of your Web page that can display a 
background — including <div> tags and heading tags. For example, you 
could alter the <body> tag to include background settings that apply to the 
entire page, or you could create an ID style with a background setting that 
would add a background color only to an individual <div> tag. By including 
the background in the ID style of a <div> tag, you can limit the background 
to appear on-screen only where the <div> tag is used.
In the example shown in Figure 5-8, I’ve defined the rule for an ID style named 
#mainContent to include a background image, which I’m further defining 
with the No-Repeat option. Another advantage of CSS is that it includes more 
precise control of background images than is possible with HTML — which, 
by default, repeats a background image across and down a page.
 
Figure 5-8:

You can choose from these Background options:
 
✓ Background-Color: Specifies the background color of a defined style. 
You can use the color well to open a Web-safe color palette in which you 
can select predefined colors or create custom colors.
 
✓ Background-Image: Enables you to select a background image as part of 
the style definition. Click the Browse button to select the image.
 
✓ Background-Repeat: Determines how and whether the background 
image tiles across and down the page. In all cases, the image is cropped 
if it doesn’t fit behind the element to which the style is applied. The 
Repeat options are

157
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
• No-Repeat: The background is displayed once at the top, left of the 
element.
 
• Repeat: The background image repeats vertically and horizontally 
in the background of the element.
 
• Repeat-X: The background repeats horizontally, but not vertically, 
in the background of the element.
 
• Repeat-Y: The background repeats vertically, but not horizontally, 
in the background of the element.
 
✓ Background-Attachment: This property determines how the back-
ground behaves when the page is scrolled.
 
• Fixed: The background remains glued to one place in the viewing 
area and doesn’t scroll out of sight, even when the Web page is 
scrolled.
 
• Scroll: The background scrolls along with the Web page.
 
✓ Background-Position (X): Enables you to align the image left, center, 
or right, or to set a numeric value to determine the precise horizontal 
placement of the background. You can use horizontal positioning only 
with No-Repeat or with Repeat-Y.
 
✓ Background Position (Y): Enables you to align the image top, center, 
or bottom, or to set a numeric value to determine the precise vertical 
placement of the background. You can use vertical positioning only with 
No-Repeat or Repeat-X.
The Block category
The Block category (see Figure 5-9) defines the spacing and alignment set-
tings and is commonly used for styles that will define the display of text on a 
Web page.
You can choose from these Block category options:
 
✓ Word-Spacing: Defines the amount of white space inserted between 
words in points, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), picas, inches, 
pixels, ems, and exs. (See the later section “Understanding CSS size 
options.”)
 
✓ Letter-Spacing: Defines the amount of white space inserted between let-
ters in points, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), picas, inches, pixels, 
ems, and exs.

158
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
✓ Vertical-Align: Aligns inline elements, such as text and images, in rela-
tion to the elements that surround them. Your options are Baseline, Sub, 
Super, Top, Text-Top, Middle, Bottom, and Text-Bottom, or you can set 
a numeric value. Note that not all Web browsers support all these options 
and results can vary among browsers.
 
✓ Text-Align: Enables you to left, right, center, or justify your text. You 
can (for example) use this setting as part of the definition of an ID style 
when you want to align the contents of a <div> tag, as when you center 
the text in a footer. (You can find details about styling <div> tags in 
Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Text-Indent: Specifies how far the first line of text is indented. Negative 
numbers are allowed if you want the first line to begin off the page.
 
✓ White-Space: Tells the browser how to handle line breaks and spaces 
within a block of text. Your options are Normal, Pre (for preformatted), 
and Nowrap, which prevents elements from being separated if they must 
wrap to fit within a browser window or other container.
 
✓ Display: Indicates how to render an element in the browser. For exam-
ple, you can hide an element by choosing None and change the position-
ing of an unordered list from horizontal to vertical, by choosing Inline.

The Box category
The Box category (see Figure 5-10) defines settings for positioning and spac-
ing. As you can read in Chapter 6, these settings are ideal for creating page 
layouts with ID styles to position <div> tags.

159
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
Figure 5-10: 
The Box 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
You can use the Box category properties to set these values:
 
✓ Width: Enables you to specify a width for any element that can have its 
dimensions specified, such as a <div> tag. You can use pixels, points, 
inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, or percentages for 
your measurements. (See “Understanding CSS size options” earlier in 
this chapter for the basics of sizing with ems, exs, and percentages on 
the Web.)
 
✓ Height: Enables you to specify a height for any element that can have its 
dimensions specified. 
 
 The Height field is often left empty to enable elements (such as <div> 
tags) to expand to fit their contents.
 
✓ Float: Enables you to align elements, such as images and <div> tags, to 
the left or right of a page or other container causing text or other ele-
ments wrap around it.
 
✓ Clear: Prevents floating content from overlapping an area to the left or 
right, or to both sides of an element. This is a useful option for prevent-
ing overlapping of elements, especially when the Float option is used.
 
✓ Padding: Sets the amount of space within the borders of an element. For 
example, you can use padding to create space between the borders of a 
<div> tag and its contents. You can set padding separately for the top, 
right, bottom, and left. Padding is measured in pixels, points, inches, 
centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, and percentages.
 
✓ Margin: Sets the amount of space around the outside of an element. 
Margins can be used to create space between the edge of an element 
and other elements on the page, such as between an image and text or 
between two <div> tags. You can set the margin separately for the top, 
right, bottom, and left. Padding is measured in pixels, points, inches, 
centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, and percentages.

160
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Setting padding and margin spacing can be tricky because they add to the 
overall size of your image, div, or other element. For help on setting these 
options to best fit your design, see Chapter 6.
The Border category
The Border category defines settings — such as Width, Color, and Style — 
and is commonly used to define borders around images, tables, and <div> 
tags. As shown in Figure 5-11, you can specify border settings on all four 
sides of an element or create borders only on one, two, or three sides of an 
element. With this technique, you can use the border settings to create divid-
ing lines between <div> tags that create columns or add separating lines 
above or below elements.
 
Figure 5-11: 
The Border 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
The List category
The List category defines settings, such as the size and type of bullets for 
list tags. You can specify whether bullets are Disc, Circle, Square, Decimal, 
Lower-Roman, Upper-Roman, Lower-Alpha, Upper-Alpha, or None (see Figure 
5-12). Choose None if you want to use the list tag with no bullet. If you want 
to use a custom bullet, you can use the Browse button to insert an image to 
be used as the bullet. You can also control the location of the list bullet in 
relation to the list item. In Chapter 6, you find instructions for redefining the 
unordered list tag to create rollover effects for links, a popular option for cre-
ating navigation rows and other collections, or lists, of links.

The Positioning category
The Positioning category (see Figure 5-13) enables you to alter the way ele-
ments are positioned on a page. As you can read in Chapter 6, positioning 
can dramatically change the way block-level elements appear in a browser. 
Block-level elements include table, list, header, paragraph, and <div> tags. 
For example, AP Divs in Dreamweaver are simply <div> tags that use abso-
lute positioning to place elements in a specific part of a page.

Positioning 
category

Rule

162
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
To understand how positioning works, it’s important to know that positioning 
is always determined relative to something else, such as another element on 
the page or the browser window. How you set up positioning depends on 
where your element is on the page — and on whether the element is inside 
another element (such as a <div> tag). Here are the Positioning options:
 
✓ Position: Enables you to specify the position of an element, such as a 
<div> tag. Options include
 
• Absolute: Uses the top and left coordinates to control the posi-
tion of an element relative to the upper-left corner of the browser 
window or the upper-left corner of an element that contains the 
element. (For example, the positioning of an AP Div contained 
within another AP Div is based on the position of the first AP Div.)
 
• Fixed: Positions an element relative to the top-left corner of 
the browser. The content of an element using fixed positioning 
remains constant even if the user scrolls down or across the page.
 
• Relative: Uses a position relative to the point where you insert the 
element into the page or relative to its container.
 
• Static: This option simply places the content at its location within 
the flow of the document. By default, all HTML elements that can 
be positioned are static.
 
✓ Width, Height: Enables you to specify a width and height that you can 
use in styles you apply to images, <div> tags, or any other element that 
can have its dimensions specified. These settings serve the same func-
tion as the Width and Height in the Box category. Entering a value in 
either category causes the same value to appear in the other.
 
✓ Placement: Defines the size and location of an element within its 
containing element. For example, you can set the right edge of the 
element to line up with the right edge of the element that contains it. 
You can specify the Top, Right, Bottom, and Left options separately and 
you can use pixels, points, inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, 
exs, or percentages for your measurements. (See “Understanding CSS 
size options,” earlier in this chapter, for basics about ems, exs, and 
percentages.)
 
✓ Visibility: Enables you to control whether the browser displays the 
element. You can use this feature, combined with a scripting language 
(such as JavaScript), to change the display of elements dynamically. 
For example, you can cause an element to appear on a page only when 
a user clicks a button — and then make it disappear when the button is 
clicked again. The Visibility options are
 
• Inherit: The element has the visibility of the element in which it’s 
contained. This is the default.

163
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
• Visible: The element is displayed.
 
• Hidden: The element isn’t displayed.
 
✓ Z-Index: Controls the position of an element, such as an AP Div, on the 
Z-coordinate, which controls the stacking order in relation to other ele-
ments on the page. Higher-numbered elements overlap lower-numbered 
elements. (Note: This setting only works on elements that use absolute 
or relative positioning settings.)
 
✓ Overflow: Tells the browser how to display the contents of an element if 
the container, such as a <div> tag, can’t fit the element’s entire size.
 
• Visible: Keeps content, such as an image or text, visible, even if it 
expands beyond the defined height or width of a container. 
 
• Hidden: Cuts off the contents if they exceed the size of the con-
tainer. This option doesn’t provide scroll bars.
 
• Scroll: Adds scroll bars to the container regardless of whether the 
contents exceed the element’s size.
 
• Auto: Makes scroll bars appear only when a container’s contents 
exceed its boundaries.
 
✓ Clip: When the content of an element overflows the space allotted and 
you set the Overflow property to Scroll or Auto, you can set the Clip set-
tings to specify which part of the element is visible by controlling which 
part of the element is cropped if it doesn’t fit in the display area.
The Extensions category
Extensions (see Figure 5-14) include filters and cursor options:
 
✓ Page-Break: Can be set for before or after an element to insert a point 
in a page where a printer sees a page break. This option enables you to 
better control the way a page is printed.
 
✓ Cursor: Defines the type of cursor that appears when a user moves the 
cursor over an element.
 
✓ Filter: Enables you to apply special effects, such as drop shadows and 
motion blurs. 
 
 Filters are visible only in Microsoft Internet Explorer, which is now used 
by a minority of the Web audience so most Web designers avoid these 
options.

Using the CSS Styles Panel
The CSS Styles panel, as shown in Figures 5-15 and 5-16, provides a great 
place to create, attach, view, manage, organize, and edit CSS Styles. To open 
the CSS Styles panel, choose Window➪CSS Styles or click the small double-
arrow at the top of the panel group and then double-click CSS Styles.
When you work with the CSS Styles panel, you can switch between two 
modes, accessible by clicking the All or Current tabs at the top-left of the 
panel. The next two sections explain each mode in more detail.
Looking for conflicts in Current mode
When you select the Current tab at the top left of the CSS Styles panel, you 
can view the styles currently applied to any selected element on a page, as 
shown in Figure 5-15.
 
Current mode is useful for identifying how styles are applied to a particular 
element and for troubleshooting when styles conflict. Although I do most of 
my design and development work in the All mode, described in the next sec-
tion, Current mode is great place to test styles, especially when you’re not 
sure which styles may be affecting a particular element on your page.
The cascade part of Cascading Style Sheets refers to the fact that multiple 
styles can apply to the same element in much the same way wave after wave 
of water might cascade over a series of rocks. Using Current mode, you can 
see how multiple styles can work together — or cause conflicts. For example, 
the text in a heading may get its font from the body style and its color and 

165
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
size from a heading style. When I place your cursor in the heading and the 
click Current mode in the CSS Styles panel (as shown in Figure 5-15), you can 
see both styles displayed — as well as how the rules in each style affect the 
same heading.
 
Figure 5-15: 
The Current 
mode of the 
CSS Styles 
panel, 
showing 
the styles 
applied to 
a headline 
selected in 
the open 
document.
 
The Current mode has three sections: the Summary for Selection pane, the 
About pane, and the Properties pane.
 
✓ In the Summary for Selection pane, you see the rules currently defined 
for the selected style. This pane is especially useful when you’ve created 
a complicated layout and are trying to understand how different styles 
may be affecting the same element.
 
✓ In the About pane, you see a text description of where a formatting 
option is defined for any rule selected in the Summary of Selection. 
(Note that this pane has two small icons in the bottom right corner. 
Click the icon on the left to “show information about the selected prop-
erty,” as shown in Figure 5-15. Click the small icon to the right of that, to 
“show cascade of rules.”)
 
✓ In the Properties pane, you can edit, add, or delete style rules just as 
you can in All mode.
Working with the big picture in All mode
The All tab, which is selected by default, displays a list of all the CSS rules 
defined in a document’s internal style sheet and in any attached external 
style sheets. I do most of my CSS designing and development in this mode 
because I like to see all the styles that affect my site as I work on creating 
new ones and editing existing styles.

166
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
When the CSS Styles panel is in All mode, you can do the following:
 
✓ See the styles in a style sheet: To view the styles in an internal or exter-
nal style sheet in the CSS Styles panel, click the plus sign (the triangle 
on the Mac) to open the style sheet within the panel. You’ll find the 
arrow (or triangle) next to the <style> tag if the page includes an inter-
nal style sheet. If the page includes one or more external style sheets, 
click the arrow next to the name of any style sheet to view the style 
rules included in it. Figure 5-16 shows a Web page with an external style 
sheet (named deer.css ) and an internal style sheet identified by the 
<style> tag in the CSS Styles panel.
 
✓ View style properties: Select a style in the CSS Styles panel, and its 
properties are displayed in the Properties pane at the bottom of the 
CSS Styles panel. (Note: You may need to click and drag the bottom of 
the CSS Styles panel down to reveal the pane at the bottom.) Notice 
in Figure 5-16 that the #container style is selected in the CSS Styles 
panel, and the definition of the style is displayed in the Properties pane 
at the bottom of the panel.

 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
✓ Edit styles: You can edit any selected style in the Properties pane by 
typing to change settings or selecting an option from the drop-down 
lists. (These handy lists appear when you place your cursor in a field 
and are great for making quick changes.)
 
 I generally find it easier to edit a style — especially if I’m making a lot of 
changes — in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box because the all options 
are so well organized in the categories described in the preceding sec-
tion. To open a style so you can edit in the CSS Rule Definition dialog 
box, double-click any style name in the CSS Styles panel.
 
If you don’t see any styles listed in the CSS Styles panel, you probably haven’t 
defined any styles for the document or attached an external style sheet with 
styles. Occasionally, however, the styles in an external style sheet won’t 
appear on-screen, even if the name appears in the CSS Styles panel. (I’ve seen 
this happen sometimes when I open a file that was created in a previous ver-
sion of Dreamweaver or a site that was moved from one computer to another.) 
In this case, an easy solution is to simply reattach the style sheet the same 
way you would attach a style sheet to a new page (see the next section for 
details).
Creating and listing styles
At the bottom-left of the CSS Styles panel (shown in Figure 5-16), you see 
three small icons that make it easy to change among the Show Category, 
Show List, and Show Only Set Properties views. These options apply to the 
Properties pane in both Current and All modes. Here’s how they work:
 
✓ Show Category View: Dreamweaver displays all the properties available 
for a selected rule organized by the category to which they belong. For 
example, all the font properties are grouped into a Font category.
 
✓ Show List View: Dreamweaver displays all the properties alphabetically.
 
✓ Show Only Set Properties: In this view, Dreamweaver displays only the 
properties you’ve defined for a selected rule. This is the default setting — 
and the option shown in Figure 5-16. I prefer this option because it makes 
identifying the settings for any selected style quick and easy.
The second set of icons, on the bottom right of the CSS Styles panel (also 
shown in Figure 5-16) aren’t dependent on the view settings. From left to 
right, these icons represent 
 
✓ Attach Style Sheet: When you click this icon, you can browse to find any 
existing external style sheet in a site and attach it to the open page. (See 
“Attaching an external style sheet to a page,” later in this chapter, for 
help.)

168
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
✓ New CSS Rule: Click this icon to open the New CSS Rule dialog box and 
create a new style.
 
✓ Edit Style: Click this icon to open any style selected in the CSS Styles 
panel in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box where you can edit it.
 
✓ Enable/Disable Style: Click this icon to temporarily turn off any style. 
This is handy if you want to see how the style is affecting elements on 
the page.
 
✓ Delete CSS Rule: Select any style name in the CSS Styles panel and click 
this Trash icon to delete it.
 
You can also rename styles in the CSS Styles panel, but be careful. You can 
rename styles in the CSS Styles panel in two ways — and only one changes the 
corresponding HTML code automatically. If you change the name of a style in 
the style sheet, you must also change the name wherever the style is used in 
your Web-page code or the style will no longer work. See the section “Moving, 
copying, and editing styles,” later in this chapter. See Chapter 6 for details.
Switching between CSS and HTML 
Mode in the Property Inspector
The Property inspector is split into two sections: HTML and CSS. In Figure 
5-17, you see the HTML mode of the Property inspector; Figure 5-18 shows 
the CSS mode. Notice that buttons on the left side of the Property inspector 
make switching between these two modes easy.

mode of the 
Property 
inspector.
 
 
Figure 5-18: 
The CSS 
mode of the

169
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
If you’re new to CSS and HTML, understanding the differences between these 
two modes can be a little confusing. Essentially, if you use the formatting 
icons, such as bold and italic, in HTML mode, Dreamweaver adds HTML 
tags and attributes. If you use these same icons in CSS mode, Dreamweaver 
launches the New CSS Rule dialog box so you can create a style that includes 
these formatting options.
In CSS mode, you can also choose to edit existing styles to add new format-
ting options to styles that are already applied to text, images, or other ele-
ments on a page. Thus you can edit existing styles by simply selecting the 
style from the Targeted Rule drop-down list and then using the Font, Size, 
and other fields in the Property inspector to make any changes or additions.
 
Any time you edit an existing style that has already been applied to elements 
on a page, the changes you make to the style are applied automatically any-
where the style is used. That’s wonderful when you want to change several 
things at once — but it can be problematic if you want to make a heading 
appear one way on one page and another way somewhere else. 
Anytime you want to create or edit a style, use the Property inspector in CSS 
mode. On the other hand, if you want to apply an existing style to an element 
on the page, make sure you’re in HTML mode first. For example, if you want 
to align an image with a class style or apply an ID style to a <div> tag, you 
need to be in HTML mode. To apply a style in HTML mode, select the image, 
text, or other element in the page where you want to apply the style and then 
use the Class or ID drop-down lists to select the style; Dreamweaver auto-
matically applies it.
Similarly, if you want to apply an HTML tag, such as the <h1> tag, you want 
to be in HTML mode, but if you want to create or edit a CSS rule for the <h1> 
tag, you want to do that from the CSS mode. Of course, you don’t have to 
create or edit styles with the Property inspector. Consider this a shortcut 
method; you may still prefer the CSS Rule Definition dialog box (covered in 
the previous section) when you want to make significant changes to a style.
 
The ability to see HTML and CSS in the Property inspector was new in 
Dreamweaver CS4 and continues in CS5. In earlier versions of Dreamweaver, 
the Property inspector displayed only HTML properties.
Organizing Style Sheets
External style sheets (or linked style sheets) offer the greatest advantages 
with CSS, but you also need to manage these style sheets separately from 
your HTML Web page. The following sections introduce you to the exter-
nal style sheets that come with Dreamweaver, as well as tips for attaching, 
moving, copying, and editing styles in external style sheets.

170
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Saving time with ready-made style sheets
 
Adobe includes several sample style sheets for you to use in your Web sites. 
These come in the form of external style sheets that have been created with 
some popular styles to give you a jump-start in designing your pages. You can 
use these styles as-is or modify them to suit your needs.
To create a new external style sheet using one of the sample style sheets pro-
vided by Adobe, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-19.
 
2. Choose Page from Sample.
 
3. In the Sample Folder list, select CSS Style Sheet to display the list of 
CSS style collections.
 
4. Select any of the sample styles listed under Sample Page.
 
 A preview of styles is displayed at the far right of the New Document 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-19.
 
5. Select a set of styles you like and click Create.
 
 A new, untitled style sheet opens in code view. You can always edit 
these styles further to change any or all of the defined rules.
 
Figure 5-19: 
You can 
preview 
sample style 
sheets in 
the New 
Document 
dialog box.
 

171
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
6. Choose File➪Save (or Save As) give the style sheet a name and save it 
in the local site folder of the site where you plan to use it. 
 
 You can name the style sheet anything you like — just don’t use spaces 
or special characters — and you can save it in the main local site folder 
or any subfolder within it. (In Chapter 2, you find instructions for setting 
up a site and defining a local site folder.)
To use the styles in your new external style sheet, you need to attach it to an 
open file by following the instructions in the next section “Attaching an exter-
nal style sheet to a Web page.”
 
When you do save a CSS file created from a sample style collection, 
Dreamweaver leaves the original style collection unchanged. That means you 
can make edits to the new style sheet without affecting the original — and can 
always create a new copy by repeating the steps just given.
Attaching an external 
style sheet to a page
After you’ve created an external style sheet, you can attach it any Web page. 
In the step-by-step instructions that follow, you can use any of the style 
sheets included in Dreamweaver (covered in the previous section), or you 
can use these instructions to attach any style sheet you create. (You find 
detailed instructions for creating your own style sheets in Chapter 6.) Begin 
by opening the page to which you want to attach the style sheet and then 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪CSS Styles.
 
 The CSS Styles panel appears.
 
 
2. Click the Attach Style Sheet icon in the CSS Styles panel (the first 
button in the lower-right area).
 
 
 The Attach External Style Sheet dialog box appears (as shown in 
Figure 5-20).
 
3. Click the Browse button and locate the CSS file in your local site 
folder.
 
 You can also enter a URL if you want to use a remote CSS file located on 
another Web site, but it’s most common to use a style sheet contained 
within the Web site you’re working on. Either way, Dreamweaver sets 
the link to the style sheet automatically, includes the code for the style 
sheet’s link at the top of the HTML file, and lists all the styles in the 
external style sheet in the CSS Styles panel.

172
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 5-20: 
The Attach 
External 
Style Sheet 
dialog box.
 
 
4. Select the Link or Import option.
 
 If you’re attaching a style sheet to an HTML file, your best choice is 
almost always to choose Link, which is the default option. Choose 
Import if you want to create one master external style sheet that con-
tains references to other style sheets, an advanced option that enables 
one style sheet to refer to another.
 
5. In the Media drop-down list, choose an option.
 
 With the Media drop-down list, you can specify the intended use for 
the style sheet. For example, if you’ve created a style sheet that for-
mats your page for printing, choose the Print option. You can leave this 
option blank if you’re attaching a style sheet to control the way the page 
appears in a browser.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the external CSS file is automatically linked 
to the page. Any styles you’ve defined in the external style sheet appear 
in the CSS Styles panel, listed under the name of the style sheet, and all 
the styles automatically become available for use on the page.
 
You can attach multiple style sheets to the same HTML page. For example, 
you can save all your text styles in one style sheet, save all your layout styles 
in another, and then attach both to the same document — which makes all 
the defined styles available to the page. Similarly, you create different style 
sheets for different purposes, such as one for printing the file and another for 
browser display.
Moving, copying, and editing styles
After you attach an external style sheet to a document, you can move, copy, 
and edit styles as follows:
 
✓ Moving styles: Move any internal styles into the external style sheet by 
simply clicking the name of a style in an internal style sheet in the CSS 
Styles panel and dragging it onto the name of an external style sheet. In 
Figure 5-21, you can see that I’m moving a body style from the internal 

173
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
style sheet, which by default is <style>, into the external style sheet 
layout.css. If you have attached more than one external style sheet to 
a document, you can also move styles from one external style sheet to 
another using click and drag.
 
✓ Copying styles: You can copy styles from one document to another by 
right-clicking (Control-clicking on a Mac) a style name in the CSS Styles 
panel and choosing Copy. Then open the document where you want to 
add the style, right-click (Control-click on a Mac) the name of an internal 
or external style sheet in the CSS Styles panel, and choose Paste.
 
✓ Editing styles: You edit styles in an external style sheet the same way 
you edit styles in an internal style sheet: by clicking or double-clicking 
the style name in CSS Styles panel. (For more detailed instructions, see 
the sections in Chapter 6 about editing class styles and editing styles 
in Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts.) Any changes you make to a style in an 
external style sheet are applied automatically to all the files to which the 
external style sheet is attached. (Remember: You must upload the style 
sheet to your Web server for the changes to take effect on the published 
version of the site.)
 
Figure 5-21: 
Click and 
drag to 
move styles 
from an

If you want to edit a remote CSS file, download the file to your hard drive 
before you open it in Dreamweaver. In Dreamweaver, you open .css files by 
double-clicking them or choosing File➪Open, both of which open the style 
sheet in code view. Code view is the only view available for CSS files because 
they’re text files and have no layout components. When you view an external 
style sheet this way, you can still use the CSS Styles panel to edit any defined 
styles — even if the style sheet isn’t linked to an HTML page. Be sure to save 
it when you finish editing it!
If you prefer, you can also edit the code by hand directly in code view. Figure 
5-22 shows an example of a style sheet opened directly in Dreamweaver. 
Notice that the CSS Styles panel displays all relevant style information and 
gives you access to the CSS editing tools.

When you edit an external style sheet, you must upload it to your server

W
hether you’re new to CSS or you’ve been struggling (I mean design-
ing) with styles for years, Dreamweaver’s many CSS features offer 
welcome assistance to even the most experienced designers.
This chapter walks you through the process of creating and applying styles 
using the class, tag, and ID selectors. You also find instructions for custom-
izing the CSS layouts that are included with Dreamweaver. And you discover 
not only how to create styles for text, but also how to position and align 
images, text, and other elements on a Web page (even how to center text and 
other elements, which is not as easy as you might imagine with CSS).
Finally, you discover how Dreamweaver makes it easy to edit, rename, and 
even remove styles.
 
If you’re new to CSS or Dreamweaver, before you start this chapter, I recom-
mend that you at least skim through Chapter 5, where you find an introduc-
tion to CSS, and a review of the many panels, dialog boxes, and inspectors you 
can use to create, apply, and edit styles in Dreamweaver.

176
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Brace yourself: You’re getting into some of the most complex Web-design 
features that Dreamweaver has to offer, but I think you’ll find the power and 
precision of these options well worth the effort. If you want to create Web 
designs that are efficient to create and maintain, display well in a variety of 
screen sizes, and you want to ensure that your pages meet the latest Web 
standards — CSS is clearly your best option. 
Creating Styles with Class 
and Tag Selectors 
Get ready to create your first styles. I start out with the class and tag selec-
tors in the following sections because they are among the easiest to 
understand.
As you go through the steps to create a new style in Dreamweaver, you may 
be surprised by the number of options in the many panels and dialog boxes 
available for creating CSS. However, you use only a few of the available 
options to create most styles. 
 
You can always refer to Chapter 5 for more detailed descriptions of the differ-
ent selector types, as well as the many options in the New CSS Rule and CSS 
Rule Definition dialog boxes that you can use when you create or edit styles.
Creating styles with the class selector
The class selector can be used to create styles that you can apply to any ele-
ment on a page and that can be used as many times as you like on the same 
page. Thus class styles are ideal for defining the formatting of things like 
photo captions, which may appear in many places in a Web site.
Using styles created with the class selector is a relatively straight-forward 
process. First, you create a new style using the class selector and give it a 
name; then you apply it to an element on the page by selecting that style 
name from the Class drop-down list in the Property inspector. In this section, 
you find step-by-step instructions for creating a style with the class selector, 
and in the next section, you see how to format text by applying a style cre-
ated with the class selector. These same instructions can be used to create 
and apply any class style in Dreamweaver.
 
You can always refer to Chapter 5 for a general description of each style selec-
tor type (class, ID, tag, and compound) as well as tips about how and when 
each is best used. 

177
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
To define a new class style, create a new document or open an existing file, 
and then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the New CSS Rule icon at the bottom of the 
CSS Styles panel.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The New 
CSS Rule 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Choose a selector type.
 
 To create a class style, choose (you guessed it) Class from the Selector 
Type drop-down list.
 
3. In the Selector Name field, type a new name for the style beginning 
with a dot (.).
 
 For this example, I type .caption.
 
 You can name a class style anything you like, as long as you don’t use 
spaces or punctuation, but class style names must begin with a dot (.). 
If you choose the Class option and neglect to enter a dot at the begin-
ning of the name, Dreamweaver adds one for you when you click OK.
 
4. From the Rule Definition drop-down list, choose where you want to 
create the selector. 
 
 Choose This Document Only (which is what I choose in this example) 
to create the new style in an internal style sheet. An internal style sheet 
applies only to the current page, which means the style can only be used 
to format elements in the document you have open in Dreamweaver. 
When you select this option, the style is created and added to the top of 
the open HTML page in the <head> section.

178
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 If you prefer, you can choose the New Style Sheet File option to create 
a new external style sheet as you create the style, or you can use 
the drop-down list to select any existing external style sheet already 
attached to the page and add the new style to it.
 
 Note: If you create a style as an internal style, you can move it to an 
external style sheet later. (You find instructions for editing and moving 
styles at the end of Chapter 5.)
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-2.
 
6. Choose a category from the left of the CSS Rule Definition dialog box.
 
 For this example, I chose the Type category, as shown in Figure 6-2. (For 
a detailed description of each category, refer to the section about com-
paring CSS rule options in Chapter 5.)
 
Figure 6-2: 
The Type 
category 
of the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
 
7. Choose the formatting options you want to include in your class 
selector.
 
 For my sample style, I made the following choices:
 
• In the Font-Family field, you can choose a font list collection 
from the drop-down list or enter the name of a font. As you see 
in Figure 6-2, I chose Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. To use a font 
that isn’t included, choose the Edit Font List option from the 
drop-down list and create a new font list using your own fonts. 
Just beware that your visitors will see the font only if that font is 
installed on their computers, which is why Dreamweaver includes 
collections of commonly used fonts. (For more on using fonts on 
the Web, see the section, “Why so many fonts?” in Chapter 5.)

179
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
• In the Font-Size drop-down list, I chose the size for my caption 
style. For this example, I chose Small to create a style that will 
make the text appear smaller than the rest of the text on the page 
(which is set to Medium by default). You can specify text sizes 
in pixels, picas, mm, and several other measurements. (For an 
explanation of options, see the section “Understanding CSS size 
options,” in Chapter 5.)
 
• In the Font-Style drop-down list, I chose Italic as the font style. 
 
• In the Font-Weight drop-down list, I chose Bold for the weight.
 
• To choose a color for the style, I clicked the color well. Sticking 
to the default color swatches in the color well (the square icon) 
is certainly the quickest way to choose a color, but you can also 
create custom colors by clicking the icon that looks like a rainbow-
colored globe in the upper-right corner of the color well and select-
ing a color from the System Color Picker. For this example, I chose 
a dark blue color.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The new style name is added to the CSS Styles panel (as shown in Figure 
6-3, a little later in this chapter). If the new style isn’t visible, click the 
plus sign (+) (or triangle on the Mac) next to the <style> tag to reveal 
the rules in the current style.
 
When you create a class style, such as the .caption style in this example, it’s 
also added to the Class drop-down list in the Property inspector, as you see in 
the following section.
Applying class styles in Dreamweaver
Defining class styles in Dreamweaver is the time-consuming part. Applying 
them after you define them is the time-saving part. How you apply a style 
depends on the kind of style you’ve created. To apply a class style in 
Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an existing document or create a new one. After you add some 
text, click and drag to select the text or other element to which you 
want to apply a style.
 
 In this example, I’ve selected the text under the photograph in the page 
shown in Figure 6-3.
 
2. In the Property inspector (with the HTML features displayed), select 
the style from the Class drop-down list.

180
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 6-3: 
To apply a 
class style, 
select the 
text or other 
element in 
the main 
workspace, 
and then 
choose the 
style from 
the Class 
drop-down 
list in the 
Property 
inspector.
 
 
 Notice that Dreamweaver provides a preview of the style by formatting 
the name in the drop-down list based on the specified options in the 
style definition (in this example, the .caption style is displayed as 
bold, italic, and green). When you choose a style, the selected text or 
other element changes automatically in the Document window to reflect 
the application of the style. Figure 6-3 shows the caption style created in 
the previous section applied to the text below the photograph.
Creating styles with the CSS tag selector
In addition to creating new class styles, you can create styles that add or alter 
the rules of existing HTML tags. These styles are created using the tag selec-
tor, which is also known as the element selector. When you create a style in 
the New CSS Rule dialog box using the tag selector option, you can alter the 
appearance, position, and other features of an existing HTML tag.
Many HTML tags already include formatting options. For example, the head-
ing tags include formatting to style text in large and bold. So, when you 
create a style with a tag selector, you have to consider the formatting options 
already associated with that tag. Any options you specify in the CSS Rule 
Definition dialog box will either be added to the existing formatting, or will 

181
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
override the formatting. For example, in the steps that follow, I create a CSS 
rule for the <h1> tag by changing the font to Georgia, which will take the 
place of the default font Times — but I don’t need to include bold in the style 
definition to make the text bold because bold is in the default style of the 
<h1> HTML tag.
 
When you create a style for an existing HTML tag, you don’t need to apply the 
style for the formatting to change the way you do with class styles. Wherever 
you’ve used the HTML tag, the style definition settings are applied automati-
cally. Thus, when you create a style and define the font for the <h1> tag as 
Georgia, any text formatted with the <h1> tag will change to Georgia.
You may ask, “Why would I redefine the <h1> tag instead of just creating a 
new headline style as a class style?” Although you can define a new class 
style instead of redefining and HTML tag, sometimes using an existing HTML 
tag is better. Heading styles are especially important on the Web because 
text formatted in an <h1> tag is well recognized as the most important text 
on a page. Among other things, text formatted in an <h1> tag may get special 
consideration from search engines.
To redefine an HTML tag (such as the <h1> tag) with the tag selector, create 
a new file or open an existing one and then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click (Control-click a Mac) anywhere in the 
CSS Styles panel and choose New, or you can click the New CSS Rule 
icon at the bottom right of the CSS Styles panel. The icon looks like a 
small plus (+) sign.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
2. Choose Tag from the Selector Type drop-down list.
 
3. Choose the HTML tag you want to redefine from the Selector Name 
drop-down list.
 
 You can also type to enter the name of a tag into the Selector Name field. 
In this example, I typed h1 to redefine the <h1> heading tag.
 
4. From the Rule Definition drop-down list, choose to add the style to an 
internal or external style sheet.
 
 In this example, I choose to add the new style to an external style sheet. 
In this case, I’ve already attached a style sheet named slides.css to 
this page so it’s easy to add the new style. In Figure 6-4, you can see that 
I’m selecting the slides.css file from the Rule Definition drop-down 
list at the bottom of the dialog box. You can choose the New Style Sheet 
File option to create a new external style sheet as you create the style, 

182
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
or you can select This Document Only to add the new style to an inter-
nal style sheet.
 
 You can attach an external style sheet to any or all of the pages in a 
Web site. When you select this option, the style is created and added 
to a separate CSS file. If you edit a style in an external style sheet, any 
changes you make will be applied to all the pages that style sheet is 
attached to where that style (or HTML tag) is used.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
 
6. Choose a category and specify the options you want to use to redefine 
the new tag style.
 
 For this example, I redefined the <h1> tag to use the Georgia font 
instead of the default browser font, changed the size to extra large, and 
changed the text color to dark green.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Any text or other element you’ve formatted with the HTML tag immedi-
ately changes to reflect the formatting in the new definition of the tag’s 
style.
 
If you want the ability to use the same HTML tag with different formatting 
in different parts of the same page, you can create compound styles, as 
described in Chapter 5. This works well, for example, if you want text format-
ted with the <h2> tag to look different in the main part of your page than it 
does in a sidebar.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Use the tag 
selector to 
redefine 
an existing 
HTML tag 
(such as 
<h1>) and 
to save the 
new style to

style sheet.

 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
Creating Layouts with CSS and Div Tags
The key to understanding how CSS works in a page layout is to think in terms 
of designing with a series of infinitely adjustable containers, or boxes. Indeed, 
this approach to Web design is commonly called the box model. 
Think of the box model this way: First you use XHTML tags, such as the 
<div> (division) tag or <p> (paragraph) tag, to create boxes around each 
section of your content. Then you use CSS to style each box, using CSS rules 
to control the position and alignment of each box by specifying such settings 
as Margin, Padding, Float, and Border. The combined effect is one beautiful 
page, created by combining CSS styles with XHTML tags.
Although you can use any XHTML tag as part of your page layout, the <div> 
tag is used most often to create the boxes for main sections of a page, such 
as the banner area, commonly used at the top of a page, the main con-
tent area, sidebars, and footer. Think of <div> tags as generic containers 
designed to contain text, images, or other content. Essentially, <div> tags 
create divisions on the page, separating one section of content from another. 
Unlike other HTML tags, <div> has no inherent formatting features. Unless 
CSS is applied to a <div> tag, it’s invisible on a page when viewed in most 
Web browsers; yet the tag has a powerful purpose because you can easily 
format with CSS any content surrounded by opening and closing <div> tags.
Adobe uses the box model to create all the CSS layouts included in 
Dreamweaver. In these layouts, each <div> tag in the page has a correspond-
ing style. As a result, to change the size or positioning of the header, footer, 
or any of the other main areas of the page separated by <div> tags, you need 
to edit the corresponding style. You find detailed instructions for how to 
identify and edit these styles in the sections that follow.
Splitting the view
If you’re creating a series of <div> tags to 
position content on a Web page, you may find 
it easier to keep track of the <div> tags if you 
use Dreamweaver’s split view, as shown in this 
figure. Split view enables you to see the code 
view and design view simultaneously. To split 
the workspace area, choose View➪Code and 
Design or click the Split View button, located 
just under the Insert panel at the top of the 
workspace.
If you select an image, text, or another element 
on a page in design view, it’s highlighted auto-
matically in code view — a great feature that 
makes it easier to find your place in the code

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Using Dreamweaver’s CSS Layouts
 
Dreamweaver includes a collection of CSS layouts you can customize to create 
a seemingly infinite variety of page designs. These layouts give you a head 
start when you create a new page; they’re designed to work well in a variety 
of Web browsers, so they can help you avoid common problems caused by 
the different ways Web browsers display CSS. For all these reasons, I almost 
always recommend starting your design work in Dreamweaver with a CSS 
layout chosen in the New Document window.
One of the challenges with CSS is that it’s still a relatively new addition to the 
world of Web design, and it continues to change. Unfortunately, browser sup-
port — which can make the difference between a beautiful Web page and a 
jumbled, unreadable design — hasn’t always kept up, and the companies that 
make browsers haven’t always agreed on how to display CSS. (You find more 
about browser differences and testing in Chapter 4.)
To help you get around the problems caused by browser differences, Adobe 
dedicated the equivalent of decades of time (at least in Internet years) to 
designing a collection of CSS layouts designed to display well in many dif-
ferent Web browsers. Whether you’re creating a simple XHMTL page, using 
Dreamweaver’s templates, or designing advanced database-driven sites with 
PHP, you’re sure to appreciate the benefits of starting your page designs with 
one of Dreamweaver’s prestyled layouts.
when you’re trying to troubleshoot what’s hap-
pening behind the scenes.
I like to use split view to keep an eye on the code 
as I create page designs — especially when I’m 
inserting <div> tags. When you’re using only 
design view, keeping track of how <div> tags 
are arranged and nested can be hard.
(continued)

185
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
Before you rush off to check out all the cool CSS layouts included in 
Dreamweaver, let me warn you: They’re not much to look at when you first 
open them. They’re intentionally designed with the most basic of formatting 
options and a dull color scheme — but fortunately color styles are some of 
the easiest to alter in CSS.
No matter what your experience level, the following sections are designed to 
help you appreciate how Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts work, and to help you 
create your own page designs by customizing the layouts step by step. You 
find out how to change the width of columns, the formatting styles for text, 
and the alignment of any element on the page in one of Dreamweaver’s lay-
outs. If you’re new to CSS, altering one of these layouts may seem confusing 
at first, but trust me: it’s certainly easier than creating a design from scratch. 
(If you haven’t read Chapter 5 yet, you can skim that chapter to get a handle 
on the basics before you begin working with Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts.)
Comparing CSS layout options
Dreamweaver includes a variety of CSS layouts, designed with two distinct 
approaches to CSS. When you create a new page with one of these layouts, 
the first thing you must do is decide which type you want to use. Essentially, 
you have two options:
 
✓ Liquid layouts are designed to expand and contract depending on the 
size of the browser window.
 
✓ Fixed layouts are centered within the browser and set to a width of 
960 pixels. (As you discover in the next section, you can change the 
width by editing the corresponding style.) In the examples shown in the 
upcoming Figure 6-6, I’ve selected a design that creates a two-column, 
fixed layout, with a left sidebar, header, and footer.
 
In general, fixed layouts give you greater control over your design and are an 
easier option to start with because you have better control of positioning the 
elements on a page. However, liquid designs do have advantages. Because 
liquid designs are designed to be flexible, they adapt to fit many different 
screen sizes.
Creating a new page with a CSS layout
To create a new page using one of Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts, follow these 
instructions:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears (see Figure 6-5).

186
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. Choose Blank Page from the left column and HTML from the Page 
Type column in the middle.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose an option in the bottom part of the Page 
Type section that corresponds to the programming language used on your 
site, such as ASP.NET, PHP, or ColdFusion, and then progress to Step 3. (If 
you’re not familiar with these programming options, stick with HTML.)
 
3. Select any of the CSS layouts listed in the Layout section.
 
 For this example, I chose 2 Column Fixed, Left Sidebar, Header and Footer.
 
 Notice in Figure 6-5, that when you select a CSS layout, a preview of the 
layout is displayed at the top right of the dialog box.
 
Figure 6-5: 
When you 
select the 
name of a 
CSS layout 
in the New 
Document 
dialog box, 
a preview 
appears in 
the top-right 
corner.
 
 
4. From the Layout CSS drop-down list, choose the type of style sheet you 
want to create as you design the page.
 
• Choose Add to Head to create an internal style sheet and include 
all the styles for the layout in the Head area of the new document.
 
• Choose Create New File to create a new external style sheet with all 
the page styles as you create the new document with the design.
 
• Choose Link to Existing File to add the style sheet information for 
the new document to an existing external style sheet.
 
 Note: You can always change how the style sheet is set up later by 
moving styles from an internal style sheet to an external one or from 
one external style sheet to another. (You can find instructions for 
creating external style sheets and moving styles at the end of Chapter 5.)
 
5. Click Create.
 
 The new page is created and opened in the main workspace.

187
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
6. Choose File➪Save to save the page and styles.
 
 If you saved the styles in an external style sheet, a second box prompts 
you to save the style sheet separately. If the styles are contained in an 
internal style sheet, they’re saved automatically when you save the page.
 
 It’s important to save all the pages of a Web site, including external 
styles sheets, in your local site folder. (For more about defining a Web 
site and specifying a local site folder in Dreamweaver, see Chapter 2.)
Editing the styles in a CSS layout
After you create a new page with a CSS layout, you have a seemingly infinite 
number of options for editing it, but first you have to determine which styles 
in the style sheet correspond to the elements you want to edit.
Why Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts use class styles 
instead of ID styles with <div> tags
Although there’s no hard and fast rule, the 
common practice is to combine ID styles with 
<div> tags to create the main sections of a 
page when you create a layout using CSS. The 
differences among style selectors are covered 
in more detail in Chapter 5, but essentially, ID 
styles are best used for elements that will only 
appear once per page, such as the main sec-
tions of a page, which are commonly identified 
as the container, header, and footer of a page. 
In contrast, class styles can be used mul-
tiple times on each page so they are more 
versatile and ideal for styles you want to use 
over and over, such as a style for the caption 
under a photo, or a style that adds alignment to 
elements. 
If you study the code behind Web pages on 
the Internet (you can do this by choosing 
View➪Page Source in Firefox, or View➪Source 
in Internet Explorer), you’ll quickly discover that 
Web pages are created in many, many different 
ways; not everyone follows the same rules.
The designer who created the CSS layouts in 
Dreamweaver decided that it was simpler and 
more versatile to create these layouts using 
class styles, so you won’t see ID styles in the 
style sheets at all. 
Again, it’s not wrong to use only class styles, 
but that’s different from the approach many 
people use on Web sites these days. To help 
you appreciate both approaches, this chapter 
shows you how to edit the class styles used for 
the main content areas in the Dreamweaver 
CSS layouts, and how to use ID styles for this 
purpose when you create a custom CSS layout.

188
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
In this example, I’ve chosen a fixed-width layout, so I know I need a style that 
specifies the fixed width for the entire layout. Following a common prac-
tice of using <div> tags to contain elements on a page and using styles to 
describe how they should be displayed, every CSS layout in Dreamweaver 
includes a <div> tag with a style named .container. To change the width 
of a design, change the corresponding .container style, as shown in this 
section.
The steps in the following sections explain how to edit the overall design of 
a page created with a Dreamweaver CSS layout. I’ve broken the process into 
several step lists to help you following along more easily. Note: The steps 
assume you’re proceeding through the sections in order.
As you can probably imagine, you can edit the styles in a CSS layout in many 
ways to create your own designs, but the process I explain in the following 
sections should serve you well as you get started with any of these layouts. 
 
After you adjust the existing styles to get the basic page design the way you 
want it, you can create as many additional styles as you desire. For example, 
in my example in this section, I delete the <div> tags and styles in the side-
bar that are included in this layout to create a row of vertical links. Instead, I 
want links across the top of the page, just under the banner (which you learn 
to create in the section “Creating a Navigation Bar from an Unordered List of 
Links,” later in this chapter). 
Checking out the available styles and making basic edits
You can use these same basic instructions with any CSS layout included in 
Dreamweaver. To edit styles in a CSS layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a page file that’s based in a Dreamweaver CSS layout, and 
choose Window➪CSS Styles (or click the CSS Styles button to expand 
the panel).
 
 The CSS Styles panel opens or expands, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
2. Click the plus (+) sign (or a triangle on a Mac) next to the style sheet 
name to open the list of styles.
 
 All the styles associated with the new page are listed.
 
 To change any element in the design of this page, you edit the corre-
sponding style.
 
3. Select the name of any style listed in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The corresponding CSS rules defined for the style are displayed in the 
Properties pane at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel, as shown in 
Figure 6-6. Clicking through the list of styles and reviewing their corre-
sponding rules is a good way to get a quick overview of the design and 
to see where the various page-formatting options are stored.

189
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
Figure 6-6: 
Alter any 
style in a 
CSS layout 
by editing a 
style defini-
tion in the 
CSS Styles 
panel.
 
 
The styles named .container, .header, .sidebar1, .content, and 
.footer, are the styles that control the main sections of the page. For exam-
ple, the style named .container, which is shown in Figure 6-6, includes a 
rule that makes the entire design area 960 pixels wide. Thus, to change the 
width of the page, you’d change that setting. (You find detailed instructions 
for editing the .container and other main styles in this CSS layout in the 
section, “Customizing the content areas” later in this chapter.) As explained in 
the nearby sidebar “Why Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts use class styles instead 
of ID styles with <div> tags,” Dreamweaver CS5 includes no ID styles in the 
CSS layouts. 
Editing page-wide settings
To edit page-wide settings — such as the background color of the page, or 
the main font face, size, and color of the text used throughout the page — 
follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the style for the <body> tag in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens with the rules for the <body> 
tag style displayed, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
2. Select the Type category from the options at the left in the dialog box, 
and change or add your desired Font settings.

190
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 You can change the font face, size, style, and weight. To change the 
space between lines of text, change the line height.
 
3. Select the Background category and use the color well in the 
Background-Color field to specify a color for the entire background of 
the page.
 
 Alternatively, you can enter any hexadecimal color code manually in the 
Background-Color field. To add a background image, click the Browse 
button to the right of the Background-image field and select the image 
you want to serve as the background. Use the Background-repeat drop-
down list to specify how the background image should repeat (if at all) 
on the page.

Customizing the content areas
To change the width or other settings of the main content areas, which con-
trol the overall size of the page, as well as the header, footer, and sidebar, 
follow these steps:
 
1. To change the width of the entire main design area, double-click the 
.container style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 You open the .container style in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box. 
If you click once to select a style (such as the .container style), your 
choice’s style definition appears in the Properties pane (refer to Figure 
6-6), where you can also edit the style.
 
2. Select the Box category on the left of the CSS Rule Definition dialog box.
 
 The box settings open in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-8.

 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
3. Select a size in the width field or type a new number for your desired 
page width.
 
 In this example, I selected the width, which was set to 960, and I 
changed it to 780. When you alter the width of the .container style, 
as I did here, you change the width of the entire design because all the 
other <div> tags are contained within the <div> that’s formatted with 
the .container style — and they’re all set to expand to fill the 
.container <div>. (For more on the best width for a Web page, see 
the nearby sidebar “How wide should I make my Web page’s design?”)
 
Figure 6-8: 
To change 
the width of 
the design, 
use the 
Box cat-
egory in the 
CSS Rule 
Definition 
dialog box 
to the edit 
the style 
.container.
 
 
4. Click Apply to preview the changes. Click OK to save the changes and 
close the dialog box.
 
 The new size is applied automatically to the .container <div> — and 
the page layout changes. 
 
 Reducing the width of the .container <div>, causes the .content <div> 
to drop below the sidebar because the .content <div> is now too 
wide for the space created by the .container. This is a common prob-
lem, because when you change one style, you often affect elements con-
trolled by other styles. The next step explains how to fix the problem.
 
5. Double-click the .content style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The .content style opens in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box. Choose 
the Box category again; this time, reduce the width of the .content style. 
 
 If you’re wondering what size to make the width of the content style, 
consider this: It’s set to 780 pixels wide. You’ve just reduced the overall 
layout of the page from 960 to 780 — by 180 pixels. So if you reduce the 
size of the .content style by 180 pixels, it should fit and pop right back 
into place. That means setting the width to 600 pixels — assuming you 
don’t want to change the width of the left sidebar.

6. To change the background color of any style on the page, double-click 
the corresponding style and select the Background category in the 
CSS Rule Definition dialog box.
 
 In the CSS layout I’m using in this example, the sidebar is defined in 
a style named .sidebar1. Thus, to change the background color, I 
double-clicked .sidebar1 in the CSS Styles panel to open it in the CSS 
Rule Definition dialog box. Then I selected the Background category 
and clicked the color well (as shown in Figure 6-9) to change the color. 
(Note: Changing the background color of the sidebar will not change the 
color of the links at the top of the sidebar in this layout. Move on to the 
next step to find out how to edit those.)

7. To change the links in the top of the left sidebar, double-click the 
compound style ul.nav a, ul.nav a:visited to open it in the CSS 
Rule Definition dialog box.
 
 Again, select the Background category and use the color well to change 
the color. Select the Box category to change the width or adjust the pad-
ding. (See “Comparing Margins and Padding in CSS,” later in this chap-
ter, for more on these design elements.)
 
8. To edit the section at the top of the page, double-click the header 
style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 Select the Background category and use the color well to change the 
color. Select the Box category to change the width or adjust the padding.

 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
9. To add an image to the banner, simply double-click the placeholder 
image labeled Insert Logo and select any image using the Select Image 
Source dialog box, shown in Figure 6-10.
 
10. Replace text and insert images in the sidebar and main content areas.
 
 You can add or replace text and insert images in any page created from 
a CSS layout, just as you would in any other Web page.
 
11. Choose File➪Save to save the page and styles.
 
 If you saved the styles in an external style sheet, you’re prompted by 
a second dialog box to save the style sheet separately. If the styles are 
contained in an internal style sheet, they’re saved automatically when 
you save the page.
 
You can combine CSS layouts with Dreamweaver’s template features to create 
a template — a page design you can use to create additional pages without 
repeating all the steps to customize the styles for each page. (As you discover 
in Chapter 7, Dreamweaver’s template features offer many advantages when 
you’re designing a site with more than a few pages; for example, you can make 
changes that affect many pages at once.)
Here’s a related tip: If you intend to use the design as a template, make sure 
you save your styles in an external style sheet so you can edit the style rules 
outside the template. (Find instructions for creating external style sheets and 
for moving internal styles into an external style sheet in Chapter 5.)

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Creating a Navigation Bar from 
an Unordered List of Links
Here’s a great CSS trick for turning a bulleted list (or unordered list) into a 
navigation bar with a simple rollover effect. Using a bulleted list for navi-
gation bars is a well-accepted convention for Web sites that meet current 
accessibility standards. A bulleted list is a logical choice for navigation ele-
ments; even if the style rules are removed, the links still stand out from the 
rest of the elements on the page and are clearly grouped together in a list. In 
Figures 6-11 and 6-12, you see how the same page appears with and without 
the styles applied to the content. In Figure 6-11, you see links contained in an 
unordered list. In Figure 6-12, those same links are still contained in the unor-
dered list, but the CSS styles change their appearance dramatically.
Thanks to CSS, you can gain the benefits of styling a list of links with the 
unordered list tag and still format your links with any style you choose. That 
way you don’t have to keep those boring bullets and can align your links 
horizontally or vertically. Using CSS instead of images to create a rollover 
effect (like the one featured in the following steps) not only makes your page 
more accessible, but also helps your page load faster.
Creating compound styles
Compound styles make it possible to create 
more specific styles. These have many uses, 
but one of my favorites is the ability to create 
tag styles that appear differently in different 
parts of the same page.
When you redefine a tag (as with the unordered 
list and link tags), the new style applies to all 
uses of that tag within a page, unless you define 
the tag as a compound style by including the 
name of its container in the style name.
For example, in the “Creating a Navigation 
Bar from an Unordered List of Links” sec-
tion, instead of creating a new tag style with 
just the name of the <ul> tag, I created a 
compound style called #navbar ul to rede-
fine the <ul> tag only when it’s contained 
within a <div> tag with an ID of navbar.
When you create compound styles like this, 
make sure you separate each style name by 
a single space. In this example, I also created 
styles for the <li> and <link> tags in the 
same way, creating styles with names like 
#navbar a:link, #navbar a:hover, 
and #navbar ul li. You can create com-
pound styles with multiple tags and style names 
to create more specific CSS rules.

195
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
As you figure out different design tricks, like the navigation bar I explain in this 
section, you may find it helpful to see other pages without the styles applied, 
as you do in Figure 6-11. In Firefox, you can turn off the styles on any page that 
uses CSS by choosing View➪Page Style➪No Style. As you see in Figure 6-11, 
when the styles are turned off, the page looks very different. In Figure 6-12, 
you see how the styles cause the <div> tags to align so the three photos 
appear side by side in three columns. Similarly, the styles make the navigation 
links appear as a horizontal row instead of an unordered list. 
 
You can use the following steps to add a list of links to any CSS layout 
included in Dreamweaver, as well as to any custom CSS layout you create 
yourself. 
To create a navigation bar using CSS to redefine the unordered list and link 
tags, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor where you want to create your navigation 
bar in the page.
 
 When you’re creating a list of links to serve as your navigation bar, it’s 
good practice to position those links at the top or side of the page where 
visitors to your site can find them easily.
 
Figure 6-11:

Figure 6-12: 
This is the 
same page 
shown in 
Figure 6-11, 
but the 
styles are 
turned on.
 
 
2. Enter the text you want to serve as the links, separated by paragraph 
returns.
 
 Be sure you use a paragraph return to separate each text block that you 
want to link; each link will be on a separate line and easy to format as an 
unordered list.
 
 You can type any text you want, but it’s generally recommended that you 
keep the main navigation links in your site very short. For example, use a 
single word when possible (such as “Home”) instead of something longer 
(such as “The front page of the site”).
 
3. Create links by selecting each piece of text in turn, clicking the 
Hyperlink icon in the Common Insert panel, and then selecting the 
page you want to link to, or entering any URL.
 
 Essentially, you set these links as you would set any other links in your 
site. (You find more detailed instructions for creating a variety of differ-
ent types of links, including links to other Web sites and e-mail links, in 
Chapter 2.)
 
4. Click and drag to select the entire set of links, and then click the 
Unordered List icon in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 6-13.
 
 A bullet point appears at the beginning of each link. If any link isn’t set 
off with a separate bullet, click to delete the space between it and the 
link before it, and then press Return or Enter to separate the links with a 

197
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
paragraph return (which will be automatically converted into a bullet in 
the unordered list).
 
5. To add a <div> tag around a list of links (or any other content that is 
already on a page, click to select the content and then click the Insert 
Div Tag icon in the Common Insert panel.
 
 The Insert Div Tag dialog box opens.
 
 Adding a <div> tag around the unordered list of links is helpful if you 
want to add formatting, such as the background color that fills the entire 
navigation row in this example.
 
6. Choose Wrap Around Selection from the Insert drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 6-14.
 
 For more precise control over where you add a new <div> tag, you can 
choose options from the Insert drop-down list at the top of the Insert 
Div Tag dialog box. Choosing the Wrap Around Selection option, for 
example, adds open and close <div> tags to the code before and after 
the content you’ve selected. In this case, that’s the bulleted list of links. 
 
7. Enter a name in the Class field or the ID field and click OK.
 
 A <div> tag with the class or ID name you entered is added automati-
cally to the page surrounding the list of links.
 
 In this example, I chose to create a class style with the name .navbar 
(as shown in Figure 6-14) by choosing Wrap Around Selection as 
described in Step 6.
 
 You can create a class or ID style to format the <div> tag that surrounds 
your list of links. If you plan to have only one navigation bar on the page, 
an ID style is a good option. If you plan to repeat the navigation bar in 
more than one place (as I’ve done in this example by adding a navigation 
bar to the top and bottom of the page), it’s a good idea to create a class 
style so you can use it twice on the same page. (Remember: ID styles can 
be used only once per page, but if you create a class style, the navigation 
bars will be formatted exactly the same each time you use that class style.)

8. Click the New CSS Rule button at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel to 
define the new style name you entered when you added the <div> tag.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box opens. 
 
9. Choose the option from the Selector Type drop-down list that corre-
sponds with the type of style you want to create.
 
 In this example, I’m creating a class style to go with the class name 
(.navbar) that I gave to the new <div> tag. If I had chosen to add an ID 
instead of a class in Step 7, I would choose ID from the drop-down list to 
create a corresponding style.
 
10. Enter the name of the style and click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
 
 Note: You must enter the name exactly as you typed it when you created 
the <div> tag. In this example, I entered .navbar.
 
 If your cursor was in the <div> when you clicked the New CSS Rule 
button, the name is already entered in the Selector Name field. Unless 
you want to be very specific with this style, I suggest you delete any 
other code that might appear and enter only the name of the style: 
.navbar if it’s a class style or #navbar if it’s an ID style.
 
11. Specify your desired settings for color, background, size, margins, and 
padding.
 
 For the .navbar style shown in this example, I set the font size to small, 
and the background color to dark blue. I also added 5 pixels of padding 
to the top and bottom so the dark blue background would extend above 
and below the links.
 
12. Click Apply to preview the style. Click OK to save the style and close 
the dialog box.
 
 The formatting options you specified are applied automatically to the 
<div> tag around the links. 

199
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
13. To create a style that will affect only this unordered list, you create 
a compound style that includes the class name .navbar. To do so, 
follow these steps:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Selector Name field, enter .navbar ul, as shown in Figure 
6-15, and then click OK.
 
Figure 6-15:

d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, choose the Box category 
and set margins and padding to 0. 
 
e. Select the Same for All check box for both margins and padding 
to remove the margins and padding included in the <ul> 
XHTML tag.
 
f. Click OK to save the style and close the dialog box.
 
 The spacing around the list of links that was formatted as an unor-
dered list disappears.
 
14. Create a new compound style to redefine the list item tag by following 
these steps:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Selector Name field, enter .navbar ul li (make sure to 
include spaces between each name) and then click OK.

200
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the Block category 
and set Display to Inline.
 
 This changes the style of the <li> tag from vertical to horizontal.
 
e. Select the List category and set Type to None to remove the 
bullet.
 
f. Select the Box category and set margins left and right to 20 
pixels.
 
 This separates the list items from one another in the horizontal 
list. You can change the setting to any measurement to create the 
amount of space between links that best fits your design.
 
g. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.
 
15. Create a new style to redefine the link tag by following these steps:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Tag field, enter .navbar a:link and then click OK.
 
 You can make this style as specific as you choose. For example, the 
style .navbar a:link will change the appearance of any links in 
the .navbar <div>. However, if you create the style .navbar ul 
li a:link, that style will apply only to links that appear in the 
.navbar <div> and inside the unordered list tags. Because these 
are the only links I use in the .navbar <div>, I don’t need to be so 
specific; both styles will work the same in this example.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the Type category 
and set Text-decoration to None by selecting the None check box.
 
 This removes the underline from linked text.
 
e. While still in the Type category, choose a color from the color 
well to specify what color the links will be when they’re first 
loaded on a page.
 
 Here I set the text color to an off-white.
 
f. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.
 
16. Create a new style to redefine the hover-link tag so that the link color 
will change when a user rolls a cursor over the link:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Tag field, enter .navbar a:hover and then click OK.
 
 Again, I could create a more specific compound link by entering 
.navbar ul li a:hover, but it’s not necessary here.

201
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the Type category 
and set Text-decoration to None by clicking the check box.
 
 This removes the underline from linked text. If you prefer to have 
the underline appear when a user rolls a cursor over a link, check 
Underline.
 
e. While still in the Type category, choose a color from the color 
well to specify what color a link will be when users roll their cur-
sors over the link.
 
 Here I set the text color to a bright yellow. The more dramatic the 
color difference between the a:link and a:hover colors, the 
more dramatic the rollover effect.
 
f. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.
 
17. Create a new style to redefine the visited link tag so the link color 
changes after a user clicks a link:
 
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Tag field, enter .navbar a:visited and then click OK.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, choose the Type category 
and set Text-decoration to None by clicking the check box.
 
e. While still in the Type category, choose a color from the color 
well to specify a link’s color after it’s been visited.
 
 Here I set the text color to a light gray. If you want the color to 
remain the same, set the a:visited link to the same color as the 
a:link.
 
f. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.
 
18. Click the Live View button at the top of the workspace or click the 
Preview button to view the page in a browser to see the effect of the 
link styles, as shown in Figure 6-16.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Comparing Margins and Padding in CSS
When creating or editing CSS styles, new Web designers are often confused 
by how and when to use margins and padding. Both of these settings add 
space between elements — for example, a margin between text and an image 
or a little padding between the border of a <div> tag and its contents. Here’s 
how margins and padding work:
 
✓ Padding adds space inside an element. Think of padding as a way to add 
a cushion around the inside of a box so your content doesn’t bump into 
the sides of your box.
 
✓ Margins add space outside an element. Think of margins as a way to add 
space between boxes, on the sides of images, or around any other ele-
ment on a page, so things don’t bump into each other.
Figure 6-17 shows a <div> tag with a corresponding ID style that creates the 
thin black border around the <div> tag and defines it as follows:
500 pixels wide
25 pixels of padding inside the <div> tag border
50 pixels of margin spacing outside the <div> tag border
Comparing block and inline elements
As a general rule, HTML tags can be divided 
into block elements and inline elements. Block 
elements, such as the <div> tag, interrupt 
the flow of the page, creating a box or block 
around which other page elements align. In 
HTML, block elements include the paragraph 
(<p>) tag, which creates a line break before 
and after it’s used and doesn’t allow anything 
to appear alongside it. Heading tags, such as 
<h1>, <h2>, and <h3>, and list tags, such as 
<ul> and <ol>, are also block elements.
In contrast, inline elements follow the flow with 
text. For example, the <strong> and <em> 
tags, which apply bold and italics respectively, 
are inline elements. You can place these ele-
ments one after another, and a new line break 
doesn’t appear between each element. They 
simply flow with the text. For that reason, the 
<span> tag, which is an inline element, is a 
good choice for applying styles that you want 
to affect a small amount of text within a block, 
such as when you want to add a little color to 
text contained within <p> tags. Because of this, 
Dreamweaver often adds <span> tags when 
you apply a class style to text in the middle of 
a paragraph.

203
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
Figure 6-17: 
Padding is 
added to 
the inside of 
an element; 
margins are 
added to the 
outside.
 
Here’s the confusing part:
 
✓ Padding adds to the specified width. If you specify a width for a <div> 
tag (or any other box element) — as I have in Figure 6-12 — the pad-
ding increases the total width. In my example, the <div> tag will fill 550 
pixels of space on the page: 500 pixels for the width plus 25 pixels on 
each side of padding.
 
✓ Margins add to the total space taken up by an element in a page. The 
margins of the <div> tag style are set to 50 pixels, so the <div> tag is 
positioned 50 pixels from the top and left of the page and no other ele-
ment will appear on-screen closer than 50 pixels on the right or at the 
bottom. This prevents the display of any other element in that space; it 
means the <div> tag effectively takes up all that space on the page.
 
✓ Borders add to the specified element width. The ID style for the <div> 
tag also includes border settings, which cause the dark border to sur-
round the <div> tag. In this example, I created a 1-pixel border, which 
adds two pixels to the width. If you choose the thin border setting, it 
adds 2 pixels to each side of the <div> tag (4 pixels total).
Thus the <div> tag fills a total space on the page of 652 pixels:
500 pixel width
50 pixels total of padding
2 pixels of border
100 pixels for the 50-pixel margin on each side

204
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Further complicating all this is a little-understood rule of HTML called Margin 
Collapse. This is not specific to CSS, but it does affect how margins in CSS are 
displayed in a Web browser. Margin Collapse causes top and bottom margins 
between elements to overlap. The goal of Margin Collapse is to keep elements 
that appear one above the other, such as paragraphs created with <p> tags, 
from displaying with twice as much space as you’d want between them. That’s 
useful with the paragraph tag, but it can cause confusing problems when you 
set margin space above and below adjacent elements and the total margin 
space doesn’t add up the way you’d expect. For example, imagine you have 
two <div> tags, one above the other. Now imagine that you’ve set the bottom 
margin of the top <div> to 10 pixels, and the top margin of the <div> below 
it to 20 pixels. You’d expect those to combine to create 30 pixels of space 
between the two <div> tags (because you’d get 30 pixels of space if those 
same margins were set on the left and right and the <div> tags that were side 
by side). However, with <div> tags that are stacked on top of each other, the 
Margin Collapse rule causes the margins to overlap, resulting in a space that is 
equal to the largest of the two margins. In this case, the 10 pixel and 20 pixel 
margins would combine to take up 20 pixels of space between the <div> tags, 
not the 30 pixels of space you might expect because 20 pixels is the largest of 
the two margins.
The exception to the Margin Collapse rule? (Of course, there’s an exception 
to this rule. . . .) If you add a border or padding to the <div> tags, the Margin 
Collapse rule is ignored and the margin space will be the total of the two mar-
gins, plus the padding or border size. In that case, it will all add up just like 
you’d expect.
How wide should I make my Web page’s design?
Although you can set the width of your Web 
page’s design to any size, most Web design-
ers create pages that are 780 pixels wide or 
960 pixels wide. These sizes are based on the 
most common screen resolutions. If you want 
your Web pages to look good to computers 
with monitors set to 800 by 600, design your 
pages to be 780 pixels wide (to leave room for 
the borders of a Web browser). In the early 
days, most Web pages were designed for that 
resolution — but increasingly designers feel it’s 
safe to design for the higher resolution of 1024 
by 768. As of this writing, the W3Schools Web 
site reports that only 3 percent of the users of 
the Internet still have monitors set to a reso-
lution of 800 x 600. If you design for the more 
popular 1024 x 768 setting, creating a page that 
is 960 pixels wide seems to be a good choice. 
Although I generally design my own Web sites 
with a width of 960 pixels, I use Web designs 
that are 780 pixels wide for the purposes of 
this book; they fit better in the settings recom-
mended by my publisher that make the screen 
captures included in this book easier to read on

 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
Aligning and Centering Elements in CSS
In addition to formatting text, you can use CSS to align elements and position 
them in relation to one another on a page. In this section, you find out how 
to use floats to align images and other elements, how to use margin settings 
to center an element, such as a <div> tag on a page, and how to use the text 
alignment option to center text or other elements contained in a <div> tag.
Centering a page layout with CSS margins
Many Web page designs are centered on the page so they seem to float 
between the sides of the browser window no matter how wide or narrow the 
window becomes. This helps create the illusion that the design fills the page, 
even if the browser window is much wider than the design of the page.
Most Web page designs created with CSS achieve this effect by creating one 
<div> tag that surrounds all the contents of the page and then applying a 
style to that<div> tag. This is commonly done with an ID style named some-
thing like #wrapper or #container, but you can achieve the same effect 
with class styles and can name the style anything you like, as long as you 
don’t use spaces or special characters.
I generally name the style I use for this purpose #container because it con-
tains all the other tags and contents on the page. 
Thus if you want to center the design of a page, a common technique is to 
first surround all the content with a <div> tag and then create a style for 
that <div>. This technique works well whether you want to center a simple 
page or a complex page with multiple columns, images, and multimedia.
 
If your page isn’t already set up with a <div> tag around all your content, 
here’s a tip for adding one. First click and drag to select all of the text, images, 
and other contents of the page. Then choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪Div Tag. 
In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, make sure the Wrap Around Selection option 
is selected from the Insert drop-down list. Leave the rest of the fields blank 
and click OK to add a <div> tag around all the contents of your page, and 
you’re ready for the steps that follow. 
To center an entire page design, make sure that a <div> tag surrounds all of 
the contents of the page, and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New CSS Rule icon (it looks like a small piece of paper with a 
plus sign (+) over it) at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box opens. 

206
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. Choose ID from the Selector Type drop-down list.
 
 Although you can use a class style selector instead of an ID selector, the 
ID option is generally recommended for styles such as this one that you 
use only once per page.
 
3. Enter a name for the style.
 
 You can name ID styles anything you like, just don’t use spaces or spe-
cial characters. Also ID style names must begin with a # sign. If you don’t 
enter a # sign before the name, Dreamweaver adds one for you as it cre-
ates the new ID style.
 
 In this example, I named the style #container. 
 
4. Select a style sheet option from the Rule Definition drop-down list.
 
 To add the style to an internal style sheet, which makes the style avail-
able only to the page you have open, choose This Document Only. 
 
 To add the style to any existing external style sheet in the site, choose 
the name of the style sheet from the drop-down list.
 
 To create a new external style sheet as you create the style, choose New 
Style Sheet File.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box closes and the CSS Rule Definition dialog 
box opens. The name you entered appears at the top of the CSS Rule 
Definition dialog box.
 
6. Choose the Box category from the left of the dialog box and then spec-
ify the formatting settings.
 
 As shown in Figure 6-18, for the container <div> tag in this example, I 
set the width to 780 pixels. Here’s the trick to centering a <div> tag like 
this: Set the left and right margins to Auto. That way, a browser automat-
ically adds an equal amount of margin space to each side of the <div> 
tag, effectively centering it on the page.
 
7. Click the Apply button to preview the style and then click OK to close 
the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and save the style.
 
8. Click to select the ID that surrounds all the content on the page.
 
 To make sure you’ve selected the right <div> tag, click to place your 
cursor anywhere in the main part of the page, then click the <div> tag 
that is listed to the farthest left in the Quick Tag Selector at the bottom 
of the workspace. The outline of the <div> tag and all of its contents 
will be highlighted when you select it.

207
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
9. With the <div> tag selected, click to select the name of the style you 
created from the ID drop-down list in the Property inspector.
 
 The style rules you defined when you created the style are automatically 
applied to the <div> tag. In this example, the result is that the size of 
the <div> tag is changed to 780 pixels wide and the <div> tag and all 
its contents are centered on the page.
 
Figure 6-18: 
Set the left 
and right 
margins to 
Auto in the 
Box settings 
to center 
an element, 
such as a 
<div> tag, 
on a page.
 
Aligning the contents of an element
If you want to align the contents of an element, you can do that by using the 
Block category in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-19. 
This technique is useful for centering the text in a <div> tag, for example, 
or for aligning a list of navigation links to the right side of a page. A common 
approach to using this option is to create an ID or class style that you will 
apply to an entire <div> tag and include the text alignment option as part 
of the style rule. In Figure 6-19, you see that I’m setting the text-align field to 
center as part of an ID style named #footer that I plan to apply to the <div> 
tag at the bottom of the page to center the copyright information. 
 
In this example, I also used the Text category to change the size and font of 
the text in the same style named #footer. This enables me to apply all of 
these formatting options at once when I assign this ID to the <div> tag that 
surrounds the copyright information.

Aligning elements with floats
Designers often align an image, <div> tag, or other element to the left or 
right of a Web page and then wrap any text or other content around that 
element. In Figure 6-20, you see how I’ve used a style to align the image to 
the right of the column so that the text wraps up next to it on the left. In the 
steps that follow, you find out how to create styles like this one.

styles by

inspector.
 

209
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
CSS offers many advantages when it comes to aligning elements like this, but 
the way you set up these styles is not as obvious as you might expect at first 
because you use the float option. 
After you understand that you can float elements, such as images, to the left 
or right side of a page, it’s pretty easy to create styles that accomplish this 
goal. In this exercise, you learn to create two styles that are ideal for aligning 
images to the left and right of a page, complete with a little margin just where 
you need it.
To create two class styles that you can use to align images and other ele-
ments to the left and right of a page, follow these steps.
 
1. Click the New CSS Rule icon (it looks like a small piece of paper with a 
plus sign over it) at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box opens. 
 
2. Choose Class from the Selector Type drop-down list.
 
 In this case, the class selector is ideal because you’re likely to use your 
alignment styles more than once on a page. 
 
3. Enter a name for the style.
 
 You can name class styles anything you like; just don’t use spaces or 
special characters. Class style names must begin with a dot (.). If you 
don’t enter a dot before the name, Dreamweaver adds one for you as it 
creates the new class style.
 
 In this example, I named the style .float-left. 
 
4. Select a style sheet option from the Rule Definition drop-down list.
 
 To add the style to an internal style sheet, which makes the style avail-
able only to the page you have open, choose This Document Only. 
 
 To add the style to any existing external style sheet in the site, choose 
the name of the style sheet from the drop-down list.
 
 To create a new external style sheet as you create the style, choose New 
Style Sheet File.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box closes, and the CSS Rule Definition dialog 
box opens. The name you entered appears at the top of the CSS Rule 
Definition dialog box.

210
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
6. Choose the Box category from the left of the dialog box.
 
 The Box options open.
 
7. Choose an option from the Float drop-down list.
 
 To create a style that will align images or other elements to the left of a 
page, chose Left from the Float drop-down list. To create a style that will 
align images or other elements to the right of a page, chose Right from 
the Float drop-down list. 
 
 In all my sites, I create two styles like this, one to align images and other 
elements to the left, and another to align to the right. Note: Most (but 
not all) of the CSS layouts that are included in Dreamweaver CS5 already 
have float styles that you can use to align elements to the right and left. 
These class styles are named .fltlft (for, you guessed it, float left) 
and .fltrt (for float right).
 
8. Add margin space to create a margin around the floated element.
 
 It’s good practice to add margin space to the opposite side from the 
float setting. For example, if you are creating a style to float an image to 
the left, add 5 or 10 pixels of space to the Right margin field. Then, when 
you use the style to align an image to the left side of the page, a margin 
will also be created between the image and any text or other element 
that wraps next to the image.
 
9. Click OK to close the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and save the 
style.
 
 The style name and definition appear in the CSS Styles panel and 
become available in the Class drop-down list in the Property inspector.
 
10. Click to select the image or other element you want to align in the 
page.
 
11. Click to select the name of the style you created from the Class drop-
down in the Property inspector.
 
 The style rules you defined when you created the style are automatically 
applied. If you had selected an image in a page of text, the image would 
move to the left side of the page and the text would wrap around it with 
a margin between the image and text.
 
 Repeat Steps 1-9, once with the float set to Right and 5 to 10 pixels of 
margin space in the Left margin field in the Box category and again 
with the Float set to Left and 5 to 10 pixels of margin space in the Right 
margin field in the Box category.

211
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
Editing, Renaming, and Removing Styles
After you create and apply a few styles, you’re likely to want to go back and 
edit some of them. Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes it easy to rename, edit, 
and even remove styles, as you learn in the sections that follow.
Editing an existing style
You can change the attributes of any style after you create it by editing its 
style definition. This is where some of the biggest advantages of Cascading 
Style Sheets come into play. You can make global changes to a page (or 
even to an entire Web site) by changing a style; when you edit the style, the 
changes are applied automatically to every element that uses the style. 
This is one of the reasons that external style sheets are so valuable: You can 
create styles that are used on any or all pages in a site. Beware, however, that 
this capability can also lead to problems. If you decide to edit a style when 
you use it on a new page, don’t forget that you’ll be changing the formatting 
everywhere else you’ve already used that style.
 
You can create new styles by duplicating an existing style, giving it a new 
name, and then altering the style definitions. This is a time-saving trick when 
you want to create a new style that’s similar to an existing one.
To edit any existing style (whether it was created using the class, tag, or ID 
selector), follow these steps:
 
1. Open the CSS Styles panel by choosing Window➪CSS Styles.
 
2. Double-click the name of an existing style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The style is opened in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box.
 
 Alternatively, you can click once to select any style in the CSS Styles 
panel and then edit that style in the Properties pane at the bottom of the 
panel, as shown in Figure 6-21.
 
3. Edit the settings for the style to your liking.
 
• If you edit a style in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, changes 
are applied automatically when you click the Apply button or when 
you click OK. 
 
• If you edit a style definition in the Properties panel, the changes 
are applied automatically as soon as you press the Return or Enter 
key or click outside the formatting field in the panel.

212

To edit a

ble-click the 
name of the

panel; it 
opens in the 
CSS Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
Renaming existing styles
You can rename a style in the CSS Styles panel in much the same way you’d 
rename a filename in the Files panel, by clicking to select the name and 
then typing a new name. Take care, however, that renaming a style this way 
doesn’t change its corresponding reference in the HTML code for your Web 
pages.
 
If you change a name in the CSS Styles panel, you must also change the name 
in the corresponding page code, or reapply the style using the Property 
inspector — which can get complicated if you’ve used the style in many 
places.
For example, let’s say you create a class style and name it .caption and then 
apply it to the text under the photos in your Web page using the Property 
inspector (as I did in the first exercises in this chapter). Then suppose you 
decide later on to change the name of the style to .imagecaption. Changing 
the name in the CSS Styles panel is easy enough, but then you have to make 

213
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
sure that every place you’ve used that style in your site is updated — either by 
reapplying the style using the Property inspector or by changing the name in 
the code wherever the style has been applied. 
 
If you want to change the name of a class style, Dreamweaver includes a fea-
ture that updates the corresponding code automatically, but only if you 
change the name using the right-click or (Control-click) option — and only for 
class styles. If you change the name of an ID style or a compound style, you 
must reset the style using the Property inspector, or change the correspond-
ing references in the code manually using code view or the Quick Tag Editor.
To rename a class style and update the style references in the code at the same 
time, open any page where the style is used and follow these instructions:
 
1. Open the CSS Styles panel by choosing Window➪CSS Styles.
 
2. Right-click (Control-click) the name of the class style in the CSS Styles 
panel.
 
3. Choose Rename Class, as shown in Figure 6-22.
 
 The Rename dialog box opens.

choose 
Rename 
Class.
 

214
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
4. Type a new name in the New Name field and click OK.
 
 If you’ve already applied the style and the style is saved in an external 
style sheet, a dialog box opens, offering to “Use Find and Replace to fix 
the documents that use this style?”
 
 If the style you want to rename is saved in an internal style sheet, the 
name will change automatically anywhere the style is applied in the 
code. With internal style sheets, the Find and Replace dialog box does 
not open; then you don’t have all the options shown in these steps. 
However, any changes appear in the Results panel, which opens auto-
matically at the bottom of the workspace.
 
5. Click Yes to automatically update references to the style in the code 
with the new style name.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box opens (see Figure 6-23) with the name 
of the style already filled in. Don’t change these settings unless you 
know what you’re doing with these advanced search strings and want to 
alter the way Dreamweaver renames the style.

6. Click Replace All to automatically update all references to the style in 
the code.

215
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
 
 Dreamweaver warns you that this operation can’t be undone, but you 
can always rename the style again by repeating these steps if you 
change your mind.
Removing a style
If you want to remove a style from any text, image, or other element on your 
page, here are two options:
 
✓ Click to select the text, image, or other element. Then open the Class or 
ID drop-down lists in the Property inspector and choose None, as you 
see in Figure 6-24.
 
✓ Click to select the element, and then right-click (Control-click on a Mac) 
the tag the style is applied to in the Quick Tag Selector at the very bottom 
of the workspace, as shown in Figure 6-25. When you right-click a tag in 
the Quick Tag Selector, a list opens with many options, choose the cor-
responding option for the selected style. In the example shown in Figure 
6-25, it’s Set ID — which reveals a list of all of the ID styles in the site. 
Using this list, you can change or remove any style.
 
If you don’t see the tag that you want to edit in the tag selector, click to select 
the corresponding image, text, or other element in the Web page: The tag will 
appear in the Quick Tag Selector, where you can edit it.

Using Design-Time Style Sheets
 
As you get increasingly savvy about using style sheets, you’ll find that work-
ing with external style sheets affords the most power because you can link to 
them from multiple pages in your site rather than having to create a new inter-
nal style sheet for each page in your site. You have an added advantage: You 
can easily alter your styles in just one place if you need to make changes after 
styles are applied. Even better, you can create multiple external style sheets 
as part of the design process, using a Dreamweaver feature — Design-Time 
Style Sheets — to switch between them as you work on your document.
One benefit of the Design-Time Style Sheets feature is that you can view how 
different external style sheets affect your page without linking to them. This 
feature is a great way to switch quickly between style sheets in a document 
and explore various what-if scenarios with the style sheets you create — 
before you apply them. You may begin to like this feature because you can 
play around with and explore the full power of CSS. After you decide you like 
a particular style sheet, you can apply it to your page as you would any other 
style sheet. 
 
Design-Time Style Sheets affect the appearance of styles only in Dreamweaver. 
Because they’re not real links, they show up only at runtime when a 
Dreamweaver document is open. Design-Time Style Sheet info is also stored in 

217
 Chapter 6: Creating and Editing CSS Styles
a Design Note file. If you want to preserve your Design-Time Style Sheet info, 
be careful not to delete the corresponding Design Note file.
To set up Design-Time Style Sheets, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪Design-Time.
 
 The Design-Time Style Sheets dialog box appears.
 
2. To work with a specific style sheet, click the Add Item button (+) 
above the Show Only at Design-Time field.
 
 The Select File dialog box appears, and you can select a CSS file. 
Remember that CSS files usually end with a .css extension. You can 
also add multiple CSS files by clicking the Add button again.
 
3. To hide a specific style sheet, click the Add Item button (+) above the 
Hide at Design-Time field and select, from the Select File dialog box, 
the style you want to hide.
 
4. To delete a listed style sheet from either category, select the style 
sheet and click the Remove Item button (–) to delete it.

S
trive for consistency in all your designs — except when you’re trying 
to be unpredictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web 
site lively. But, most Web sites work best and are easiest to navigate when 
they follow a consistent design theme. Case in point: Most readers take for 
granted that books don’t change their designs from page to page, and news-
papers don’t change headline fonts and logos every day. Publishers of books 
and newspapers want to make life easier for their readers, and consistency 
is one of the primary tools for making sure readers find publications familiar. 
That doesn’t mean you should limit modern Web design to what’s possible in 
print, but it does mean we can all learn a thing or two from hundreds of years 
of print design.
Dreamweaver offers several features to help you develop and maintain a 
consistent look and feel across your site. In this chapter, you discover four of 
my favorite Dreamweaver features — templates, Library items, History panel, 
and the Tracing Image feature. 
Both the Templates and Library item features help you work more efficiently 
and make changes to a site faster and easier. These features work well with 
CSS, and as you discover in this chapter, you can work even more efficiently 
by combining CSS with templates and library items. After you discover how 
these features make creating and managing Web sites faster and easier, 
you’re well on your way to simplifying your work even before you start. 

220
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Templates in Dreamweaver not only make it easy to create pages with con-
sistent design elements, they make it easy to update those pages later when 
things change — and things always change.
The History panel also offers a number of timesaving features, from replay-
ing steps that are repetitive to easily jumping back to an earlier state in your 
design.
Tracing images are handy design tools, which you can insert into the back-
ground of a page to guide your design work. As you discover at the end of 
this chapter, tracing images don’t display in a Web browser, but they are 
useful if you like to first create your designs in a program like Photoshop and 
then recreate your page designs as Web pages in Dreamweaver.
Templating Your Type
You can choose from many different kinds of templates to create Web sites; 
and you can find many places on the Web where you can buy them or even 
download them for free. At its simplest, a template is a ready-made page 
design, usually created in a way that makes it easy to add your own text and 
images. Some templates are customizable so that you can change design ele-
ments, such as colors, images, or fonts.
Keep in mind that many different kinds of templates are available, and 
templates designed for a program like WordPress or Flash won’t work in 
Dreamweaver using the instructions in this chapter. (See Chapter 1 for more 
about the different kinds of templates that can be used in the many different 
ways you can create Web sites.)
In this chapter, I focus on Dreamweaver’s .dwt templates, which you can use 
to create new pages quickly as well as to make global changes across all the 
pages created from a template.
 
Dreamweaver templates are best used in the following scenarios:
 
✓ Templates are definitely the way to go when you’re creating a number 
of pages that share the same characteristics, such as the same back-
ground color, navigation elements, or logo. I recommend that you use 
a template anytime you create a site with more than a few pages. For 
example, you might create a template that includes your logo, a row of 
links at the top and bottom of each page, and styles for the text colors 
and fonts. After you create a template with all these features, you can 
use it as the basis for all the other pages in your site. This approach 
enables you to quickly and easily create a series of pages that share the 
same navigation, logo, and so on. If you ever decide to change one of 

221
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
these elements, such as your logo, you can change it once in the tem-
plate and automatically update all the pages created from the template 
in your site.
 
✓ If you want to use different design elements in different sections, 
you can even create more than one template for a site. For example, if 
you’re creating a Web site for a bed-and-breakfast inn, you might create 
one template for all the pages where you want to show off the rooms in 
the inn and another for a collection of pages that features great places to 
hike in the area.
 
 When creating multiple templates for a Web site, you may benefit from a 
nested template, a template whose design and editable regions are based 
on another template. 
 
 For example, you can create a main template for elements that appear 
on every page across an entire site, such as a navigation bar. Then for 
secondary templates, start with the main template and add nested tem-
plates that have design variations for a section (or sections) of a site.
 
✓ Templates are valuable when you’re working with a team of people 
with varying skill levels. For example, say you’re building a site for a 
pet store and want to let the employees update their own pet stories 
without messing up the page design. The fact that templates have locked 
regions can protect the most important elements of a page, making it 
easy for sales staff to add new information without accidentally breaking 
navigation elements or other consistent features.
 
The most powerful aspect of Dreamweaver’s template feature is the capability 
to make global changes to every page created from a template. Even if you’re 
working alone on a site, this aspect of templates can save hours (or even 
days) of time as the site grows and changes over time.
Creating Templates
Creating a template is as easy as creating any other file in Dreamweaver. 
You can start by creating an HTML Template page much as you would any 
other page. You can also choose File➪Save As to turn any existing page 
into a template. The main difference is that the extension for a template 
file is .dwt (Dreamweaver Web Template), and template files are stored in 
a special Templates folder. When you create your first template in a Web 
site, Dreamweaver automatically creates a Templates folder in your local 
site folder and stores all your .dwt template files in this folder. Templates 
must be kept in this common Templates folder and the folder must be kept 
at the top level or root level of your Web site (meaning you can’t move 
the Templates folder into another folder) for the automated features in 
Dreamweaver to work properly.

222
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
The template features work only if you set up your Web site in Dreamweaver. 
If you haven’t gone through the setup process to define your local site folder 
yet, see Chapter 2 and complete those setup steps first.
Creating editable and uneditable regions
Perhaps the most difficult concept to grasp when it comes to templates is 
how editable and uneditable regions work and why they’re important. Here’s 
the short answer (I get into the details later in this chapter).
When you create a template design, every aspect of the design is locked 
automatically, or uneditable, until you designate some part of the page as an 
editable region — an area of the template page that can be changed in any 
page created from the template. The steps for making a region editable are 
relatively simple (you find detailed instructions in the sections that follow). 
When you create a new page from a template, only the areas you’ve desig-
nated as editable regions can be altered. If you want to make global changes 
with a template, only the areas that you’ve left uneditable can be used to 
make changes across multiple pages.
For example, suppose you create a design for an online magazine with the 
logo and navigation bar at the top of the page and the copyright and naviga-
tion links at the bottom, and you leave all these areas uneditable. Then you 
create a design area in the middle of the page where a story and photo can 
be added to each page created from the template and you designate that area 
as an editable region. When you create new pages from the template, you 
can replace the photo and story on each page because they’re in editable 
regions, but you can’t change the logo, navigation links, or copyright because 
they’re in uneditable regions.
Now imagine that you’ve used this template to create many pages that are 
exactly the same, except that each features a different story and photo in 
the middle area designated as the editable region. Then one day you decide 
to change the logo for your company, so you need to change that section of 
the page on all the pages you’ve created. If the logo is in an uneditable region 
of the template, no problem. You simply open the template file and edit the 
logo on that one page. When you save the template, the new logo is applied 
automatically to all the pages created from that template. That saves a ton 
of time because you don’t have to replace the logo on each page separately. 
You could make the same kinds of global changes to the navigation links at 
the top and bottom of the page because they’re also in uneditable regions.

223
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
In contrast, if you make changes to the editable region in the template, those 
changes aren’t applied to the pages created from the template. This is impor-
tant because you wouldn’t want to make a global change that overwrites all 
the individual stories and photos you’ve inserted into each page. It comes 
down to this: Locked areas of a template (areas you don’t designate as edit-
able) can be changed only in the template itself, and those changes can then 
be applied automatically to all the pages created from that template. Areas of 
a template designated as editable can be changed in any page created from 
the template, but those areas can’t be updated automatically by changing the 
template.
If you’re still a little confused after all this theory, don’t worry; you see all 
this in action in the sections that follow.
Why the head section is editable by default
In a new template, all elements are locked by 
default except for the document head section, 
which is indicated by the <head>, </head> 
tags at the very top of any HTML page. Within 
the head tags you find <title> tags. The 
<title> tags enable you to change the title 
in any page created from a template, which is 
good practice. 
When you create a new template, Dreamweaver 
creates two editable regions in the head area 
of the page, one for the title, and the second 
for any scripts, links to CSS files, or other ele-
ments that must be added to the head section. 
For example, when you use behaviors on a page 
(covered in Chapter 9), Dreamweaver inserts 
JavaScript in the page at the place the script is 
used as well as in the head section of the page. 
Similarly, if you add multimedia files, such as 
Flash or Flash video, to a page, Dreamweaver 
adds special code to the header at top of 
the page to make the multimedia files play 
properly. For all these reasons, editable regions 
are automatically added to the head area when 
you create a template or save a page as a 
template.
In previous versions of Dreamweaver, if you 
created a template from an existing HTML page 
using the File➪Save As feature to save the file 
as a .dwt template file, editable regions were 
not added to the head section automatically. 
If you’re working with a template created in a 
previous version of Dreamweaver, you may run 
into this problem. You’ll know if you do because 
you won’t be able to edit the title of any page 
created from the template or add features that 
use JavaScript. To solve this problem you can 
 ✓ Re-create the template from a new file in 
Dreamweaver CS5.
 ✓ Manually add the template code to the 
head region of the existing file by copying 
it from the head region of a new template.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Creating a new Dreamweaver template
If you’re working on a new site or haven’t yet defined your site, read Chapter 
2 for information on defining the site before you create a template. 
To create a Dreamweaver template that you can use to create new pages, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens.
 
2. In the list on the left, click the Blank Template option, as shown in 
Figure 7-1.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The Blank 
Template 
panel in 
the New 
Document 
window 
displays all 
the differ-
ent types of 
templates 
you can 
create in 
Dream-
weaver. 
 
3. In the Template Type list, choose HTML Template.
 
 In this example, I’m creating a new HTML page template, which will enable 
me to take advantage of template features without using the programming 
code required in the other template options. You can also choose from 
a variety of template options, including templates for ASP (Active Server 
Pages), ColdFusion, JSP (Java Server Pages), and PHP (a recursive acro-
nym for Hypertext Preprocessor). These file types are used when creating 
dynamic Web sites and require more advanced programming than HTML. 
Find an introduction to creating dynamic Web sites in Chapter 13.
 
4. In the Layout area, choose <none> to create a blank page or select any 
of the predesigned CSS layouts.
 
 Dreamweaver’s many CSS layout options, covered in Chapter 6, pro-
vide a great head start to creating a new page design. In this example, I 
selected a CSS layout as the basis for my page design.

225
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 A new blank template is created and opens in the main work area, and 
the New Document dialog box closes.
 
6. Choose File➪Save.
 
 If you haven’t disabled the dialog box, a warning appears stating that 
the template doesn’t have any editable regions and asking whether you 
really want to save it. Click Yes to continue. You find instructions for 
creating editable regions in Step 10.
 
7. Click OK to save the page as is for now.
 
 The Save window appears with the Templates folder open. If you 
don’t already have a folder named Templates in your local site folder, 
Dreamweaver will create one for you when you create your first template. 
 
 For Dreamweaver templates to work properly, they must be saved in a 
folder named Templates in your local site folder. If you change the folder 
name or move the Templates folder into a subfolder, your templates will 
no longer work properly.
 
8. Give the template a name and click Save.
 
 The template is saved automatically with a .dwt extension, which desig-
nates the file as a Dreamweaver template. 
 
9. Create a design for the page by adding images, text, and other ele-
ments as you would in any other Dreamweaver file.
 
 You find instructions for adding all these features to your pages 
throughout this book. Again, remember, you create a page design in a 
template just like you would in any other Web page.
 
10. To create an editable region:
 
a. Select any image, text block, or content area.
 
 Often the best option is to select an entire area of a page so that 
everything in that section becomes editable. If you’ve designed your 
pages with <div> tags and CSS, as covered in Chapter 6, a good 
option is to select the <div> tag for an entire section, such as the 
mainContent div I’ve selected in this example (see Figure 7-2). 
 
 A handy way to select a section surrounded by a <div> tag is to 
place your cursor anywhere in that area of the page, and then use 
the tag selector at the bottom of the workspace to select the div, 
as shown in Figure 7-2.
 
b. Choose Insert➪Template Objects➪Editable Region (as shown in 
Figure 7-3).
 
 The New Editable Region dialog box opens.

226
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 7-2:

at the bot-
tom of the

227
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
 
c. Give the new editable region a name.
 
 I recommend something that identifies the type of content it is, 
such as headline or main-content.
 
 The region you define as editable becomes an area that can be 
changed in any page created from the template. You can have 
multiple editable regions in one template. In the site shown in this 
example, I also made the big banner photo at the top of the page 
an editable region so that I could use different banner images on 
each page. Each editable region must have a different name. Also, 
editable region names can’t use spaces or special characters, but 
underscores and hyphens are okay.
 
d. Click OK.
 
 A light blue box (with a light blue tab at the top left of the box) 
surrounds the editable region. The name you entered into the New 
Editable Region dialog box appears on the tab.
 
11. When you finish designing the page and add all the editable regions 
you want, choose File➪Save to save your template.
 
 When you save a new template page or you save an existing page as 
a template, Dreamweaver automatically adds the .dwt extension and 
saves the file into a Templates folder. 
 
If you save a template before you specify any editable regions, Dreamweaver 
gives you a warning because templates aren’t useful without editable regions. 
You don’t have to create editable regions before you save a template, but 
you can’t make any changes in any pages created from a template until you 
create one or more editable regions. You can always go back and add editable 
regions later, so it’s not a problem if you want to save your work before you 
create editable regions, which is generally good practice.
Saving any page as a template
Sometimes you get partway through designing a page before you realize that 
you’re likely to want more pages just like it and should create a template to 
avoid re-creating the same page design over and over. Similarly, you may 
want to turn a page that someone else created into a template. No matter the 
page’s origin, creating a template from an existing page is almost as easy as 
creating a new template from scratch.
To save a page as a template, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page that you want to turn into a template.
 
 Choose File➪Open and browse to find your file. Or open the site in the 
Files panel and double-click the file to open it.

228
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. Choose File➪Save as Template, as shown in Figure 7-4.
 
 The Save dialog box appears.
 
3. In the Site drop-down list, choose a site.
 
 The menu lists all the sites you’ve set up in Dreamweaver. By default, 
the site you’ve set up and opened in the Files panel is selected when the 
dialog box opens. If you’re working on a new site or haven’t yet set up 
your site, flip to Chapter 2 for information on the site setup process.
 
 You can use the Save as Template option to save a page as a template 
into any defined site, which makes it easy to save a page design from 
one site as a template for another site.
 
4. In the Save As text box, type a name for the template.
 
 Although you don’t have to add a description, if you’re working on a big 
site with many templates, descriptions can be very helpful for keeping 
track of which templates go with which sections of your site.
 
5. Click the Save button.
 
 If you haven’t disabled the dialog box, a warning appears stating that 
the template doesn’t have any editable regions and asking whether you 
really want to save it. Click Yes to continue.
 
 Notice that the file now has the .dwt extension, indicating that it’s a 
template.
 
Figure 7-4: 
You can 
save any 
HTML page 
as a 
template.
 

229
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
  
6. Click OK in the Dreamweaver dialog box that appears to update links 
in the template.
 
 Because your original file probably wasn’t saved in the Templates 
folder, any links to other pages or images must be updated when the file 
is saved. After you click OK, Dreamweaver corrects any links in the file 
as it saves the file in the Templates folder.
 
7. Make any changes that you want and then choose File➪Save.
 
 You edit a template just as you edit any other page in Dreamweaver.
 
8. To create an editable region:
 
a. Select any content area, image, or text.
 
b. Choose Insert➪Template Object➪Editable Region (refer to 
Figure 7-3).
 
 The New Editable Region dialog box opens.
 
c. Give the new region a name.
 
 You can name the region anything you like — just don’t use spaces 
or punctuation. The region you define as editable becomes an area 
that can be changed in any page created from the template. You 
can create multiple editable regions in any template.
 
d. Click OK.
 
 The editable region is enclosed in a highlighted area with a tab at 
the top left, identified by the name you gave the region.
 
9. When you finish designing the page, choose File➪Save to save your 
completed template.
Making attributes editable
In addition to making any element in a page editable, you can also make the 
attributes of any element editable. This step is only necessary if you want to 
make an attribute editable when the tag itself is not editable (for example, 
when you want the ability to change the background image of a <div> tag, 
but not the <div> tag itself). 
Editable attributes are especially handy for making the color of a link edit-
able. When you set up a list of navigation links so that you can alter the color 
of any one link on any page without losing the advantage of the template, you 
can still update all the links throughout the site by editing the template. By 
making only the color attribute of the link editable, you can change the color 
of that link when a visitor is on the corresponding page and use the color to 
identify the section a visitor is currently viewing.

230
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
To create editable attributes in a template, follow these steps:
 
1. In any Dreamweaver template, select an item that you want to give an 
editable attribute.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 7-5, I selected the navigation link About 
Us and am in the process of making one of the its attributes editable.
 
 To make sure you’ve selected a link and not just the text, click anywhere 
in the linked text and then use the Quick Tag Selector at the bottom of 
the workspace to select the <a> tag.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Templates➪Make Attribute Editable.
 
 The Editable Tag Attributes dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
3. From the Attribute drop-down list, choose the attribute you want to 
make editable.
 
 The attribute options vary depending on whether you select an image, 
link, text, or other element on the page.
 
 In this example, I selected HREF to be able to change the color of the 
link, as shown in Figure 7-6. The link tag is one of the most confusing 
HTML tags because it’s known as the anchor tag, displayed as just an 
<a> in the Quick Tag Selector. But the full tag is <a href>, and in the 
Editable Tag Attributes dialog box, it’s identified as HREF.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Select any 
link, image, 
or other tag 
and use 
the Modify 
menu to 
make the 
attributes 
of that tag 
editable.
 

231
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
 
 If the attribute you want isn’t listed, click the Add button and then enter 
the name of any attribute. 
 
4. Click to select the Make Attribute Editable check box.
 
 The options for that attribute become active in the bottom of the dialog 
box.
 
5. In the Type drop-down list, select an attribute type.
 
 As shown in Figure 7-6, the link tag has several attributes. I selected 
Color in this example.
 
6. Click OK to make the attribute editable and close the dialog box.
 
Figure 7-6: 
In the 
Editable Tag 
Attributes 
dialog box,

which attri-
butes you 
want to be

To change an editable attribute in a page created from a template, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Create a new page from the template, or open any page that was cre-
ated with the template.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Template properties.
 
 The Template Properties dialog box opens, listing any editable attri-
butes, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
3. Select the attribute you want to edit in order to see your options in the 
bottom of the dialog box.
 
 To change the color of the link, which I set up as an editable attribute 
in the preceding steps, I selected href to display the options shown 
in Figure 7-7. I then clicked the color swatch in the bottom left of the 
Template Properties dialog box and selected a color.

 The new setting is applied when the dialog box closes. In this example, 
the color of the About Us link changed to the new color after the dialog 
box closed.
Creating a New Page from a Template
After you create a template, it’s time to put it to use. You can use one tem-
plate to create all the pages in your Web site or create different templates for 
different sections. For example, in a site, such as my consulting firm site at 
www.ArtesianMedia.com shown in these examples, I created one template 
for the English version of the site, and a second template for the Spanish 
version. After you create a template or a collection of templates, using a tem-
plate to create a new page is similar to creating any other XHTML page.

233
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
To use a template to create a new page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens.
 
2. In the list on the left, click the Page from Template option, as shown 
in Figure 7-8.
 
3. In the Site list in the middle of the page, choose the name of the site 
that contains a template you want to use.
 
 The templates in the selected site appear in the Template for Site sec-
tion just to the right of the Site list in the New Document window (see 
Figure 7-8).
 
4. In the Template for Site list, select the template you want to use.
 
 Notice that when you click the name of a template, a preview of the 
selected template appears on the far right of the New Document 
window. In the example shown in Figure 7-8, I selected the artesian tem-
plate from the Artesian Media site.
 
Figure 7-8: 
From 
the New 
Document 
window, 
you can 
preview and 
select any 
template 
saved in 
any defined 
Web site 
to create a 
new page.
 
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 A new page is created from the template and appears in the main work 
area.
 
6. Edit any region of the page that’s editable with Dreamweaver’s regu-
lar editing features and save the file as you would save any other 
HTML page.
 
When you create new pages from a template, you can change only the editable 
regions in each file created from the template. When you edit a template, only 

234
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
the regions that aren’t defined as editable can be used to make global changes 
to all the pages created from the template. In the template shown in this exam-
ple, both the main content area of the page and the big banner image at the 
top of the page can be edited in the page created from the template.
Making Global Changes with Templates
The great advantage of templates is that you can automatically apply changes 
to all the pages created with a template by altering the original template. For 
example, say the navigation links are an uneditable region in a template, and I 
decide to add a new section to the site. I can add a new navigation link to that 
section by editing the row of links at the top of the page in the template, and 
the new link is added to all the pages in the site created from that template.
To update files in a site that were created from a template, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the template file.
 
 Note that template files are distinguishable by the .dwt extension and 
are saved in the Template folder.
 
 If you’re not sure which template was used to create a page, its 
name appears in the top-right corner of the page (see the upcoming 
Figure 7-10). If you don’t see the template name, choose View➪Visual 
Aids➪Invisible Elements to turn on the feature that displays the tem-
plate name. Alternatively, you can open a template from any page cre-
ated from a template, by following the steps in the next section.
 
2. Use Dreamweaver’s editing features to make any changes you want to 
the template.
 
 Remember that only changes to uneditable regions are updated auto-
matically. In this example, the logo and navigation elements are locked 
regions and can be edited to make global changes. Thus, if I add a new 
link to the row of links at the top of the page, it will be added to all the 
pages created from the template.
 
3. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Update Template Files dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-9. The 
Update Template Files dialog box lists all the pages created from the 
template.
 
4. Click the Update button to modify all pages listed in the Update 
Template Files dialog box. Click the Don’t Update button to leave 
these pages unchanged.
 
 If you click Update, Dreamweaver automatically changes all the pages 
listed in the Update Template Files dialog box to reflect any changes 
made to uneditable regions of the template.

235
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
 
Figure 7-9:

ated from

Opening a template from any 
page created from a template
If you’re not sure which template was used to create a page, you can open 
the template while you have the page open, make changes to the template, 
and update all the pages created with it by following these steps:
 
1. Open a document that uses the template that you want to change.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Templates➪Open Attached Template, as shown in 
Figure 7-10.
 
 The template opens.
 
3. Use Dreamweaver’s regular editing functions to modify the template 
as you would edit any page or template.
 
4. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Update Template Files dialog box appears (refer to Figure 7-9).
 
5. Click the Update button to modify all the pages listed in the Update 
Template Files dialog box. Click the Don’t Update button to leave 
these pages unchanged.
 
 If you choose Update, Dreamweaver automatically changes all the pages 
listed in the Update Template Files dialog box.
 
If you have a page that was created from the template open, the changes are 
automatically applied, but you need to save the page before closing it to save 
the changes.
 
You can also apply changes to all the pages created from a template with the 
Update Pages option. To do so, open the template, and then make and save 
your changes without applying those changes to pages created with the tem-
plate. Anytime later, you can choose Modify➪Templates➪Update Pages to 
apply the update.

236

Attaching and detaching templates
You can remove a template from any page by detaching it, and you can apply 
a template to an existing page by attaching it, although the page layout must 
match the template for it to work. 
You can apply a template to an existing page by using one of the following 
techniques:
 
✓ Choose Modify➪Templates➪Apply Template to Page and then double-
click the name of a template to apply it to the page.
 
✓ Drag the template from the Template Assets panel into the Document 
window. To open the Template Assets panel, click the Assets tab behind 
the Files panel tab and then click the Templates icon. You can also 
choose Window➪Assets.
When you apply a template to an existing page, Dreamweaver automatically 
searches the page and attempts to match each editable region in the tem-
plate with a section of the page. If sections don’t match, you need to recon-
cile them using the Inconsistent Region Names dialog box (see Figure 7-11). 

237
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
In the Inconsistent Region Names dialog box, you need to match each region 
name with a region in the page. If the new template doesn’t use some of the 
regions that were included in the previously applied template, you can use 
Nowhere from the drop-down list, and the older elements are not affected. 
After the region conflicts are resolved, click OK. If the page design is too 
different from the template, it may not be possible to reconcile the regions 
effectively. In that case, your best option is to re-create the page by creating 
a new page from the template and then copy and paste the content from the 
existing page into the new page created from the template.
 
Figure 7-11: 
Match each 
region in the 
template 
with a cor-
responding 
section in 
the page.
 
You can remove or detach a template from a page if you no longer want 
changes to the original template to affect the page created with the template. 
Detaching a template also unlocks all regions of a page, making it completely 
editable. You can detach a template by choosing Modify➪Templates➪Detach 
from Template. This action makes the file fully editable again, but any future 
changes you make to the template aren’t reflected on the detached page.
Reusing Elements with 
the Library Feature
The Library feature isn’t a common feature in other Web design programs, 
so the concept may be new to you even if you’ve been developing Web sites 
for a while. The Library feature is handy when you have a single element you 
want to reuse on many pages, such as a copyright statement you want to 

238
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
appear at the bottom of each page or even something as complex as a row of 
navigation links.
A Library item is a snippet of code that can contain almost anything, including 
images, videos, text, and links. You can’t, however, use features created with 
Dreamweaver’s Behaviors or Spry menu, which use JavaScript. 
After you save a section of code in the Library, you can insert it into any page 
with drag-and-drop ease. If you ever need to change a Library item (by adding 
or changing a link, for example), simply edit the stored Library item, and 
Dreamweaver automatically updates the contents of the Library item on any 
or all pages where it appears throughout the site.
 
Like templates, Library items are a great way to store frequently used items 
and make global changes to those items if you need to update them in the 
future. You have more flexibility with Library items than templates because 
they’re elements you can place anywhere on any page, even multiple times. 
Libraries aren’t shared among sites the way templates are, but you can copy 
and paste the same Library item from one site into another.
 
Library items can’t contain their own style sheets because the code for styles 
can appear only as part of the head area of an HTML file. You can, however, 
attach an external style sheet to a Library item to see how the styles affect 
the display of the Library item, but the same styles must be available on each 
page where the Library item is used for the styles to be applied. (For more on 
style sheets, see Chapters 5 and 6.)
Creating and Using Library Items
The following sections show you the steps for creating a Library item, adding 
one to a page, and editing and updating a Library item across multiple pages. 
For these steps to work properly, you must do them in sequential order. 
Before creating or using Library items, you must first set up the site and open 
it in the Files panel. (See Chapter 2 for instructions on setting up a site in 
Dreamweaver.)
 
Creating a Library item within an existing page works well because you can 
see how the item looks before you add it to the Library. You can edit an 
item after it’s in the Library, but it may not look just as it will on a Web page. 
For example, Library items don’t include <body> tags when they’re saved 
in the Library, so link colors are displayed as default blue when viewed in 

239
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
the Library, even if the link colors have been changed to, say, purple in the 
<body> tag of the page.
Creating a Library item
To create a Library item that you can use on multiple pages on your site, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open any existing file that has images, text, or other elements on the 
page that you want to save as a Library item.
 
2. From this page, select an element or collection of elements that you 
want to save as a Library item, such as the copyright information that 
appears at the bottom of this page.
 
3. Choose Modify➪Library➪Add Object to Library.
 
 The Library Assets panel opens and displays any existing Library items. 
Your new Library item appears as Untitled.
 
4. Click to select Untitled and replace it by typing a new name as you 
would name any file in Explorer on a PC or the Finder on a Mac.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 7-12, I’ve named the Library item 
copyright.
 
 When you create a Library item, Dreamweaver automatically saves it to 
the Library. Naming Library items makes them easier to identify when you 
want to use them. You can then easily apply Library items to any new or 
existing page in your site by following the steps in the next section.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Adding a Library item to a page
You can easily add elements from the Library to your pages by simply drag-
ging them from the Assets panel to the page. When you add a Library item to 
a page, the content is inserted into the document and a relationship is estab-
lished between the content on the page and the item in the Library. This is 
important because it enables you to edit the Library item later and apply the 
changes to all pages where the item appears, but it also means that you can’t 
edit the item on the page where it’s inserted. You must edit Library items 
from within the Library, as you see in the following section.
To add a Library item to a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new document in Dreamweaver or open any existing file.
 
2. From the Files panel, click the Assets tab, and then click the Library 
icon.
 
 The Library opens in the Assets panel (refer to Figure 7-12).
 
3. Drag an item from the Library to the Document window.
 
 Alternatively, you can select an item in the Library and click the Insert 
button. The item automatically appears on the page. After you insert a 
Library item on a page, you can use any of Dreamweaver’s formatting 
features to position it on the page.
Highlighting Library items
Library items are highlighted to distinguish them from other elements on a 
page. You can both customize the highlight color for Library items and show 
or hide the highlight color in the Preferences dialog box. To change or hide 
Library highlighting, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences 
(Mac).
 
 The Preferences dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Category section on the left, select Highlighting.
 
3. Click the color box to select a color for Library items and then select 
the Show box to display the Library highlight color on your pages.
 
 Leave the box blank if you don’t want to display the highlight color.
 
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.

241
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
Making global changes with Library items
The Dreamweaver Library feature saves time because you can make changes 
to Library items and automatically apply those changes to any or all pages 
where the Library item appears. To edit a Library item, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Files panel, click the Assets tab and then click the Library 
icon.
 
 The Library opens in the Assets panel (refer to Figure 7-12).
 
2. Double-click any item listed in the Library to open it.
 
 Dreamweaver opens a new window where you can edit the Library item.
 
 Because the Library item is just a snippet of code, it won’t have a 
<body> tag in which to specify background, link, or text colors. Don’t 
worry about this: The Library item acquires the right settings from the 
tags on the page where you insert it.
 
3. Change the Library item as you would edit any element in 
Dreamweaver.
 
 For example, you can change a link, edit the wording of text, change the 
font or size, and even add images, text, and other elements.
 
4. Choose File➪Save to save changes to the original item.
 
 The Update Library Items dialog box opens, displaying a list of all the 
pages where the Library item appears.
 
5. To apply the changes you made to the Library item on all the listed 
pages, click the Update button. If you don’t want to apply the changes 
to all the pages where the Library item appears, click the Don’t Update 
button.
 
 If you clicked the Update button, the Update Pages dialog box appears 
and shows the progress of the updating. You can stop the update from 
this dialog box, if necessary.
 
If you want to create a new Library item based on an existing one without 
altering the original, follow Steps 1–3, and in place of Step 4, choose File➪Save 
As and give the item a new name.
Editing one instance of a Library item
If you want to alter a Library item on a specific page where you’ve inserted 
it, or if you want to make changes to just a few pages, you can override the 

242
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
automated Library feature by detaching it, or breaking the link between the 
original item in the Library and the item inserted into the page.
 
After you break a connection, you can no longer update that page’s Library 
item automatically.
To make an instance of a Library item editable, follow these steps:
 
1. Open any file that contains a Library item and select the Library item.
 
 The Property inspector displays the Library item options, as shown in 
Figure 7-13.
 
Figure 7-13: 
You can 
detach 
a Library 
item in the 
Property 
inspector.
 
 
2. Click the Detach from Original button.
 
 A warning message appears, letting you know that if you proceed with 
detaching the Library item from the original, you can no longer update 
this occurrence of it when the original is edited.
 
3. Click OK to detach the Library item.
Remembering Your History
With the History panel, you can keep track of what you’re doing and even 
replay your steps. The History panel also lets you undo one or more steps 
and create commands to automate repetitive tasks.
To open the History panel, choose Window➪History. As soon as you open 
a file, the History panel starts automatically recording your actions as you 
work in Dreamweaver. You can’t rearrange the order of steps in the History 
panel, but you can copy them, replay them, and undo them. Don’t think of the 
History panel as an arbitrary collection of commands; think of it as a way to 
view the steps you’ve performed, in the order in which you performed them. 

243
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
 
The History panel offers a great way to let Dreamweaver do your work for you 
if you have to repeat the same steps over and over. It’s also a lifesaver if you 
make a major mistake and want to go back one or more steps in your develop-
ment work.
Here’s a rundown of how you can put the History panel to use:
 
✓ To copy steps you already executed: Use the Copy Steps option in the 
lower right as a quick way to automate steps you want to repeat. You 
can even select steps individually, in case you want to replay some (but 
not all) actions exactly as you did them.
 
✓ To replay any or all steps displayed in the History panel: Highlight the 
steps you want to replay and click the Replay button at the bottom of 
the History panel.
 
✓ To undo the results of the replayed steps: Choose Edit➪Undo Replay 
Steps.
 
✓ To apply steps to a specific element on a page: Highlight that element 
in the Document window before selecting and replaying the steps. For 
example, if you want to apply bold and italic formatting to just a few 
words on a page, you can replay the steps that applied bold and italics 
to selected text.
You can also set the number of steps displayed in the History panel by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac) 
and selecting General from the Category list on the left. The default is 50 
steps, more than enough for most users. The higher the number, the more 
memory the History panel uses.
Repeating your steps with Recorded Commands
You can automate repeat tasks using 
Dreamweaver’s Recorded Commands feature, 
available from the Commands menu. Simply 
start the record option, execute any series of 
actions in Dreamweaver, stop, and save them. 
Then, you just replay the recording to repeat 
the actions automatically. To use the Recorded 
Commands option, choose Commands➪Start 
Recording, and then carefully execute a series 
of steps that you want to be able to repeat. 
When you complete the steps you want to 
record, choose Commands➪Stop Recording 
and name the command to save it. To play 
back the actions, choose Commands➪Play 
Recorded Command and select your new com-
mand. Then kick back and watch the action; 
or better yet, take a break and get out of your 
office for a change.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Using a Tracing Image to 
Guide Your Design Work
The Tracing Image feature is especially popular among designers. The con-
cept dates back to the earliest days of design. The Tracing Image feature 
enables you to use graphics as guides for your page designs, much as you 
might copy a cartoon through thin transparent paper.
The Tracing Image feature is ideal for people who like to first create a design 
in a program, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, and then model their Web 
page after it. By using the Tracing Image feature, you can insert any Web-
ready image into the background of any Dreamweaver page. Then you can 
position <div> tags or insert tables or other elements on top of the tracing 
image, making it easier to re-create your design in Dreamweaver. You can use 
JPG, GIF, or PNG images as tracing images and you can create them in any 
graphics application that supports these formats.
 
Although the tracing image appears in the background of a page, it doesn’t 
take the place of a background image and won’t appear in a browser.
To add a tracing image to your page, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new page or open an existing page in Dreamweaver.
 
2. Choose View➪Tracing Image➪Load.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box opens.
 
3. Select a JPEG image you want to serve as your tracing image and 
click OK.
 
 The Page Properties dialog box opens with the Tracing Image options 
category selected, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
4. Click the Browse button to locate the image you want to use as a trac-
ing image.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
 
5. Click the image you want to trace from and then click Apply to pre-
view how the image looks behind the page.
 
6. Set the opacity for the tracing image with the Transparency slider.
 
 Lowering the transparency level causes the tracing image to appear faded, 
which makes distinguishing between the tracing image and content on the 
page easy. You can set the transparency level to suit your preferences, 
but somewhere around 50 percent works well with most images.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 The tracing image appears in the Document window, and the dialog box 
closes.

245
 Chapter 7: Saving Time with Dreamweaver Templates (And More)
 
Figure 7-14: 
The Page 
Properties 
dialog box 
lets you set 
the options 
for a trac-
ing image, 
which you 
can use as a 
guide when 
design your 
page.
 
You have a few other options with the Tracing Image feature. Choose 
View➪Tracing Image to reveal the following options:
 
✓ Show: Hides the tracing image if you want to check your work without it 
being visible but don’t want to remove it.
 
✓ Align with Selection: Enables you to automatically line up the tracing 
image with a selected element on a page.
 
✓ Adjust Position: Enables you to use the arrow keys or enter X, Y coordi-
nates to control the position of the tracing image behind the page.
 
✓ Reset Position: Resets the tracing image to 0, 0 on the X, Y coordinates.
 
✓ Load: Enables you to add or replace a tracing image.
After you have the tracing image in place, you can use it as a guide while you 
design your page. Because the tracing image is behind the page, it won’t inter-
fere with your design work, and you can add any elements over the tracing 
image that you could add to any other Web page. Use the tracing image as a 
reference as you insert and position <div> tags, images, and other elements.

Coming to the HTML Table
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing HTML tables
▶ Creating your tables in Standard mode
▶ Sorting your table data
▶ Importing data from other programs
▶ Working with tables for spacing and alignment
▶ Nesting your tables
I
n the early days of Web design, HTML tables offered one of the only 
options for creating complex page layouts. By splitting and merging table 
cells and using them as containers for text and images, Web developers could 
create intricate page designs despite the limits of HTML. 
Using tables to create designs was far from ideal, and most of us found this 
solution frustrating. But because tables were all we had, we had to be clever, 
and we often resorted to imperfect tricks, such as
 
✓ Using a clear GIF to control spacing (see the sidebar “The transparent, 
or clear, GIF trick,” later in this chapter). 
 
✓ Using carefully designed background images to add graphic elements 
and the illusion of layers to specific parts of a page.
 
✓ Inserting tables within tables to create ever-more elaborate designs.
If you pulled out all these tricks, you could you could use tables to position 
text, images, and other elements, anywhere you wanted on a page (well, 
almost anywhere). For example, you could use a table to align two columns of 
text side by side and then merge the cells at the top to create a wider space 
for a headline across the top like the format you might see in a newspaper or 

248
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
magazine. Because you could make the borders of a table invisible, you could 
use tables to create page layouts without the table itself being visible on the 
page. Back in the day, we were all rather proud of ourselves for figuring out 
these clever work-arounds.
 
Today CSS has completely changed the way designers create Web pages, and 
tables are no longer the recommended solution for creating page layouts, 
except when you need to format tabular data, such as content you could dis-
play in a spreadsheet or columns and rows of data exported from a database. 
Today, most professional designers use CSS to create overall page designs 
because pages designed with CSS download faster, are easier to update, and 
are more flexible and accessible than tables ever were. Chapters 5 and 6 are 
dedicated to CSS and the latest developments in Web design.
In this chapter, you discover how to create and edit tables in Dreamweaver 
in the few cases where tables are still the best solution — when you need to 
format and sort tabular data. Even though tables are no longer recommended, 
I’ve also included a few tips for working with tables for page layouts, in case 
you are still working on a site that was designed the old-fashioned way.
Creating HTML Tables
Tables are made up of three basic elements: rows, columns, and cells. If 
you’ve ever worked with a spreadsheet program, you’re probably familiar 
with tables. Working with tabular data in HTML tables is quite similar to 
working with a spreadsheet: In most cases, you’ll want to create a row of 
headings along the side or top of a table and then columns and rows that can 
be populated with text, images, and other data.
The code behind an HTML table is a complex series of <tr>, <th>, and <td> 
tags that indicate table rows, table header, and table data cells, respectively. 
Figuring out how to type those tags so that they create a series of little boxes 
on a Web page was never an intuitive process. If you wanted to merge or split 
cells to create rows or columns with varying numbers of cells, you faced a 
truly complex challenge.
Thank the cybergods that you have Dreamweaver to make this process easy. 
With Dreamweaver, you can easily
 
✓ Create tables and modify both the appearance and the structure of a 
table by simply clicking and dragging its edges.

249
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
 
✓ Add any type of content to a cell, such as images, text, and multimedia 
files — even nested tables.
 
✓ Use the Property inspector to merge and split cells, add color to the 
background or borders, and change the vertical and horizontal align-
ment of elements within a cell.
You can create tables in Standard or Expanded mode in Dreamweaver:
 
✓ Expanded mode, shown in Figure 8-1, literally expands the borders and 
table cells. The added space makes editing content within tables easier: 
You can easily select inside and around tables. However, the added 
space also changes the way the table appears in Dreamweaver, which 
can be confusing because the space isn’t visible when you view the page 
in a browser.
 
✓ Standard mode, as shown in Figure 8-2, is more consistent with how 
tables will appear in a browser, so generally do most of your table edit-
ing, especially resizing and moving tables, in this mode.
You can switch between these two modes by clicking the Standard and 
Expanded mode buttons in the Layout menu bar at the top of the work area, 
as shown in Figures 8-1 and 8-2.
Alternatively, you can switch between modes by choosing Choose 
View➪Table Mode➪Standard Mode or Choose View➪Table Mode➪Expanded 
Tables Mode.

Creating Tables in Standard Mode
Although Expanded mode is useful for selecting and editing the contents of a 
table, Standard mode is best for creating tables and editing table properties, 
such as the width of cells and the borders that surround them. The following 
tips can help you create a table, and the sections that follow explain how to 
further refine it:
 
 
✓ You can insert a table by choosing Insert➪Table or by clicking the 
Table icon in the Common or Layout Insert panel.
 
 
✓ When you insert a new table, the Table dialog box, as shown in Figure 
8-3, makes it easy to specify many table settings at once. Don’t worry 
about perfecting the settings; you can always change these options later.
 
✓ You can edit all the table options, except the Accessibility options, in 
the Property inspector. When you select a table or cell, the attributes 
appear in the Property inspector at the bottom of the work area. Click 
the border of any table to select the entire table, and the Property 
inspector displays the table options, as shown in Figure 8-4. To view all 
the options, click the expander arrow in the lower-right corner of the 
Property inspector. (All these options are described in the next section.)
 
✓ Select a table with the Select Table command. Sometimes selecting 
the entire table and not just an individual cell is tricky. If you’re having 
trouble selecting the table, simply place your cursor anywhere inside 
the table and choose Modify➪Table➪Select Table.

251
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
 
To create tables without missing any important steps, check out “Following a 
workflow for creating tables,” at the end of this section. The steps there give 
you a framework for using Dreamweaver’s table options from start to finish.

Choosing your table’s appearance
When you select a table in Dreamweaver, the Property inspector gives you 
access to the following options for customizing your table’s appearance:
 
✓ Table: Provides a text area where you can enter a name for a table. This 
name, or ID, is useful for targeting the table in scripts.
 
✓ Rows: Displays the number of rows in the table. You can alter the size 
of the table by changing the number. Be careful, though: If you enter 
a smaller number, Dreamweaver deletes the bottom rows — contents 
and all.

252
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
✓ Cols: Displays the number of columns in the table. You can alter the size 
of the table by changing the number. Again, if you enter a smaller number, 
Dreamweaver deletes the columns on the right side of the table — con-
tents and all.
 
✓ W (width): Displays the width of the table. You can alter the width by 
changing the number. You can specify the width as a percentage or a 
value in pixels. Values expressed as a percentage increase or decrease 
the table’s size relative to the size of the user’s browser window or any 
enclosing container, such as another table or a <div> tag.
 
 Table dimensions expressed as a percentage enable you to create a table 
that changes in size when the browser window is resized. For example, 
if you want a table to always take up 75 percent of the browser window, 
no matter how big the user’s monitor or display area, set the size as a 
percentage. If you want a table to always be the same size — that is, to 
remain the same size regardless of the browser window size — choose 
pixels rather than percentages for your table width. See the nearby side-
bar “How wide should you make a table?” for more help selecting a width 
that displays well on most browsers.
 
 If a table is inserted inside another container, such as a <div> tag or 
a table with a fixed width, it doesn’t change size based on the browser 
window but is sized based on the container.
 
 Note: Beginning in Dreamweaver CS4 and also in CS5, you no longer 
find an H (height) field. As a best practice, most designers don’t specify 
table height, because the table’s contents may change from one visitor 
to another. For example, the font size of text depends on a user’s system 
and settings.
 
✓ CellPad: Specifies the space between the contents of a cell and its border.
 
✓ CellSpace: Specifies the space between table cells.
 
✓ Align: Controls the alignment of the table on the Web page. The options 
are Default, Left, Center, and Right. As a general rule, the Default setting 
aligns the table from the left side of the browser window or other 
container.
 
✓ Border: Controls the size of the border around the table. The larger the 
number, the thicker the border. If you want the border to be invisible, 
set it to 0.
 
✓ Class: Provides easy access to style sheet options. (See Chapters 5 and 6 
for more on CSS.)
 
✓ Clear and Convert: The icons in the lower-left area of the Property 
inspector (click the expander arrow in the lower-right corner to view 
them) provide these formatting options:
 
• Clear Row Heights and Clear Column Widths enable you to 
remove all height and width values at one time.

253
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
 
• Convert Table Widths to Pixels and Convert Table Widths to 
Percents enable you to automatically change Width settings from 
percentages to pixels. Pixels specify a fixed width; a percent set-
ting means the browser automatically adjusts the specified per-
centage of the browser display area.
 
You can also apply formatting options and change the attributes of any ele-
ment — such as text, an image, or a multimedia file — within a table cell. To 
do so, click to select the element and then use the options in the CSS or HTML 
Property inspector to make your desired changes, just as you would if the ele-
ment weren’t in a table cell. See “Specifying cell options,” later in this section, 
for more details.
Making tables more accessible
A few simple, behind-the-scenes elements can make your tables more acces-
sible to people who are blind or have limited sight and view Web pages with 
screen readers. Screen readers are special browsers that read the contents of 
a Web page aloud. 
One important element is the table header (<th>) tag for table headings. The 
<th> tag adds bold formatting and centering to content, and identifies the 
content as the header of the row or column. 
For example, say you have a table like the one in the Dexter Tree Farm Web 
site that includes a list of trees and the number available of each kind (refer 
to Figures 8-1 and 8-2). Identifying text in the top row with the table header 
tag tells the screen reader to repeat the heading before each tree name and 
number. Thus instead of just reading a long list of names and numbers, the 
screen reader will identify each cell by the name of the header as it reads 
through the contents.
 
You don’t have to make all your table headings bold and centered just because 
you use the table header tag. Like any other HTML tag, you can alter the format-
ting of the <th> tag by creating a tag style (as I explain in Chapter 5). 
Dreamweaver also includes Accessibility options at the bottom of the Table 
dialog box when you first insert a new table (refer to Figure 8-3). Here’s what 
those options do: 
 
✓ Caption: If you enter a table caption, it’s displayed within the table. You 
can specify where the caption appears with the Align Caption option.
 
✓ Summary: The Table Summary doesn’t appear in a Web browser but 
prompts a screen reader to describe the table for visitors who can’t see 
the contents of the table. This gives your visitors overall context before 
they hear the entire table read out loud.

254
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
If you don’t include these Accessibility settings as you insert your table, there 
is no way to get back to these options in Dreamweaver. To add a label and 
summary to a table after you insert it into a page in Dreamweaver, you either 
have to re-create the table or add the code manually in code view.
Specifying cell options
In addition to changing overall table settings, you can specify options for 
individual cells within a table. When you select a cell, which you can do 
by clicking to place the cursor anywhere inside the cell area, the Property 
inspector changes to display the individual properties for that cell (see 
Figure 8-5), such as the formatting and alignment of the contents of a particu-
lar cell.
 
Beginning in Dreamweaver CS4, the Property inspector features both HTML 
and CSS settings. CSS settings are generally preferred and work the same for 
the contents of a table cell as they do for content anywhere else on a Web 
page. (See Chapters 5 and 6 for more on using CSS.)
 
You can also change multiple cells at the same time. For example, suppose 
that you want to format some (but not all) cells in your table with a certain 
background color and style of text. You can apply the same properties to 
multiple cells by selecting more than one cell at a time before choosing the 
settings in the Property inspector. Any properties you change in the Property 
inspector apply to all selected cells. Here are tips for selecting cells:
 
✓ To select adjacent cells, press the Shift key while clicking to select cells. 
 
✓ To select multiple cells that aren’t adjacent, press the Ctrl key (the Ô 
key on the Mac) and click each cell you want to select. 
Make sure the table fits the contents
Be aware that table cells automatically adjust 
to accommodate whatever you insert into them. 
For example, if you create a cell that’s 100 pixels 
wide and then insert a 300-pixel-wide image, 
the table cell expands to fit the image. This can 
cause problems if the overall size of the table 
isn’t set wide enough to accommodate all the 
objects within the table cells. When you build 
your tables, be aware of the size of the images 
and multimedia files you’re inserting into cells 
or you may end up with a mess on your hands.
For example, if you set a table to a total width 
of 400 pixels and then insert 600 pixels worth of 
images, the table is forced to adjust in a way 
that contradicts the settings. When it does, 
some content may get cut off or expand beyond 
the desired width of the page layout. Worse yet, 
the table may not appear the same in all brows-
ers as different browsers try to accommodate 
these errors in different ways, which can lead 
to unpredictable results.

255
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
 
✓ If you’re having trouble selecting an individual cell because it con-
tains an image, click the image and then use either the ← or → key on 
your keyboard to move the cursor and deselect the image, which acti-
vates the Property inspector and displays the options for that cell.
 
Figure 8-5: 
The 
Property 
inspector (in 
CSS mode) 
displays cell 
properties 
when <td> 
or <th> 
tags are 
selected. 
When one or more cells are selected (they have to be adjacent for this to 
work), the top half of the Property inspector controls the formatting of text 
and URLs within the table cells. The lower half of the Property inspector pro-
vides these table cell attribute options (refer to Figure 8-5):
 
Although the alignment, color, and formatting options in the Property inspec-
tor are handy, using CSS is the preferred option. You learn more about work-
ing with CSS and creating styles to alter the appearance of HTML tags, such as 
the table tags, in Chapters 5 and 6.
 
✓ Merge Cells icon: Merges two or more cells. To merge cells, you must 
first select two or more cells by clicking and dragging or by pressing 
either the Shift or Ctrl key while selecting multiple cells.
 
✓ Split Cell icon: Splits one cell into two. When you select this option, a 
dialog box lets you specify whether you want to split the row (you split 
the cell horizontally) or the column (you split the cell vertically). You 
can then specify the number of columns or rows, which controls how 
many times the cell divides. Note that you can apply the Split Cell option 
to only one cell at a time.
 
 See the section, “Merging and splitting cells” later in this chapter for 
more details about working with these options.
 
✓ Horz: Controls the horizontal alignment of the cell contents.
 
✓ Vert: Controls the vertical alignment of the cell contents.
 
 See “Aligning table content in columns and rows” later in this section for 
tips on working with the Horz and Vert alignment options.

256
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
✓ W: Controls the width of the cell.
 
✓ H: Controls the height of the cell.
 
✓ No Wrap: Prevents word wrapping within the cell. The cell widens to 
accommodate all text while you type or paste it into a cell. (Normally, 
the excess text just moves down to the next line and increases the 
height of the cell.)
 
✓ Header: Formats a cell’s contents by using a header tag, which displays 
the text in bold and centered by default in most Web browsers.
 
✓ Bg (color): Click in the color well to select a background color from the 
color palette or enter a hexadecimal color code into the text field. If you use 
the color palette, the hexadecimal code is entered automatically into the Bg 
color field. Make sure you include the # sign if you add your own hexadeci-
mal color or the color will not display properly in many browsers.
Aligning table content in 
columns and rows
Clean alignment of elements in columns and rows makes your table neat 
and easy to read. Achieving that look can be tricky, however, because you 
don’t have as much control in HTML as you have in a program such as Excel, 
where you can align numbers to the decimal point, for example. In an HTML 
table, you can align the content of columns to the left, right, or center. The 
following steps explain the basics of aligning rows and columns in your table 
(and you find tips for solving common alignment problems, too):
 
1. Select the column or row for which you want to change the alignment.
 
 Place the cursor in the first cell in the column or row you want to align; 
then, click and drag your mouse to highlight all the columns or rows 
that you want to change.
 
2. Choose an alignment option from the Horz (horizontal) or Vert (verti-
cal) drop-down lists in the Property inspector (refer to Figure 8-5).
 
 The content of the cell adjusts to match the selected alignment option.
 
 Alternatively, you can access many formatting options, including align-
ment options, by selecting a table and then right-clicking (Windows) or 
Control-clicking (Mac).
 
If you follow the preceding steps but table contents still aren’t aligning, try the 
following tips:
 
✓ If you use the same number of digits after the decimal point in all 
your numbers, you can get them to line up in a column. For example, if 
one price is $12.99 and another is $14, express the latter as $14.00; then, 

257
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
when you right align, the numbers line up properly. (If your columns still 
aren’t lining up the way you want them to, consider using a monospace 
font, such as Courier, which lines up better.)
 
✓ If you’re having trouble aligning the contents of adjacent cells, set the 
vertical alignment to Top. A common frustration when you’re building 
tables is that you have two or more rows side by side with text in one 
and images in the other, and you want the top of the image and the top 
of the text to line up. Often they don’t line up because they’re different 
lengths, and the table is trying to adjust the contents to best use the 
space within their respective cells. The solution is simple: Select all the 
cells you want to align, and in the Property inspector, change vertical 
alignment to Top. Seemingly like magic, all the content jumps right to 
the top of the cells and lines up perfectly. This is such a common prob-
lem that I routinely set the vertical alignment of table cells to Top.
 
✓ Make sure you use the same formatting, paragraph and break tags if 
you want the contents of adjacent cells to line up. Another situation in 
which the contents of adjacent cells don’t line up properly occurs when 
you include paragraph tags around the text or an image in one cell and 
not in another. Use split view (by clicking the Split button at the top of 
the workspace) and make sure that the code in both cells matches. If 
you have <p> tags around the contents in one cell and not in another, 
make sure to include them in the second cell or remove them from the 
first so that both cells match.
Merging and splitting table cells
Sometimes, the easiest way to modify the number of cells in a table is to 
merge cells (combine two or more cells into one) or split cells (split one cell 
into two or more rows or columns). With this technique, you can vary the 
space in table sections and customize table structures. For example, you 
may want a long cell space across the top of your table for a banner and then 
multiple cells below it so that you can control the spacing between columns 
of text or images. The following two sets of steps show you how to merge and 
split cells in a table.
To merge cells, in an existing table:
 
1. Highlight two or more adjacent cells by clicking and dragging the 
mouse from the first cell to the last.
 
 You can merge only cells that are adjacent to one another and in the 
same row or column.
 
 
2. Click the Merge Selected Cells icon, in the lower-left region of the 
Property inspector (as shown in Figure 8-6), to merge the selected 
cells into a single cell.

258
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 The cells are merged into a single cell by using the colspan or rowspan 
attributes. These HTML attributes make a single cell merge with adja-
cent cells by spanning extra rows or columns in the table.
 
Figure 8-6: 
The 
Property 
inspector 
includes 
small icons 
that merge 
and split 
cells.
 
To split a cell, create a new table or open a page with an existing table and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place the cursor inside any cell you want to split.
 
 
2. Click the Split Selected Cell icon, in the lower-left region of the 
Property inspector.
 
 
 The Split Cell dialog box appears.
 
3. Select Rows or Columns in the dialog box, depending on how you 
want to divide the cell.
 
 You can split a cell into however many new rows or columns you want.
 
4. Type the number of rows or columns you want to create.
 
 The selected cell is split into the number of rows or columns you 
entered.
Following a workflow for creating tables
If you’re starting from scratch, create a new, blank HTML page and follow 
these steps from the beginning:
 
1. Make sure that you’re in Standard mode. (Choose View➪Table 
Mode➪Standard Mode.)
 
2. Click to place the cursor where you want to create a table.
 
 In both Standard and Expanded modes, tables are created automatically 
in the top-left area of the page, unless you insert them after other content.

259
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
 
3. Click the Table icon on the Common or Layout Insert panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Table. The Insert Table dialog box 
appears.
 
4. In the appropriate boxes, type the number of columns and rows you 
want to include in your table.
 
 Remember you can always add or remove cells later with the Property 
inspector.
 
5. Specify the width, border, cell padding, and cell spacing.
 
 See “Choosing your table’s appearance” earlier in this chapter for specif-
ics about each of these options.
 
6. Choose the header option that best corresponds to the layout you 
want for your table to create a row of header cells across the top, side, 
or both.
 
7. Add a caption and summary in the Accessibility section and click OK.
 
 The table automatically appears on the page.
 
 If you’re not familiar with the header, caption, and summary options, see 
“Making tables more accessible” earlier in this chapter for details.
 
8. Click to place the cursor in a cell and then type the data you want in 
that cell. Repeat for each cell.
 
 Alternatively, you can use Edit➪Paste Special to insert columnar data 
from another program, such as Excel.
 
 If you want to import data from a table you’ve created in a program, 
such as Word or Excel, see the section “Importing Table Data from Other 
Programs,” later in this chapter. 
 
9. Apply formatting options, such as bold or italic, to selected cells and 
their contents by choosing the option from the from the Property 
inspector.
 
 The sections “Specifying cell options,” “Aligning table content in col-
umns and rows,” and “Merging and splitting table cells” explain the 
basics of table formatting.
Sorting Table Data
When you’re working with lots of columnar data, you want to be able to 
sort that data just as you do in a spreadsheet program, such as Excel. In 
Dreamweaver, you can sort data even after you format it in HTML. You still 

260
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
don’t have as many options as you do in Excel. For example, you can sort an 
entire table based on a specified row, but you can’t sort different rows 
individually.
To use the Sort Table Data feature, create a new, blank HTML page, add a 
table with several rows and columns, and add some content. (I explain how 
in the preceding section.) You may also open an existing page with a table of 
columnar data. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the table you want to sort.
 
 To select a table for sorting, you can simply place the cursor in any cell 
of the table you want to sort.
 
2. Choose View➪Table Mode➪Standard Mode.
 
3. Choose Commands➪Sort Table.
 
 The Sort Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
You can 
sort cell 
contents 
alpha-
betically or 
numerically, 
even after 
they’re 
formatted in 
HTML.
 
 
4. Specify which column you want to sort by and then choose 
Alphabetically or Numerically and Ascending or Descending.
 
 You can set up one or two sorts to happen simultaneously and opt 
whether to include the first row and whether to keep the <tr> (table 
row) attributes with a sorted row by selecting Keep All Row Colors the 
Same.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The selected cells are sorted, just as they are in a program, such as 
Excel. (Pretty cool, huh?)

261
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
Importing Table Data from Other Programs
Manually converting financial data or other spreadsheet information can be 
tedious. Fortunately, Dreamweaver includes a special feature that enables 
you to insert table data created in other applications, such as Word or Excel. 
To use this feature, the table data must be saved from the other program in 
a delimited format — the columns of data are separated by tabs, commas, 
colons, semicolons, or another type of delimiter. Most spreadsheet and data-
base applications, as well as Microsoft Word, enable you to save data in a 
delimited format; files with a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file extension 
are one example. Consult the documentation for the application you’re using 
to find out how to convert your data into a delimited format, and then you 
can import the data into Dreamweaver.
To import table data into Dreamweaver after it’s been saved in a delimited 
format (such as CSV) or in its native application (such as Access or Excel), 
create a new, blank HTML page or open an existing file and follow these steps 
to import the data:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Tabular Data.
 
 The Import Tabular Data dialog box appears (see Figure 8-8).
 
Figure 8-8: 
You can 
import 
tabular data 
into Dream-
weaver from 
other pro-
grams, such 
as Excel.
 
 
2. In the Data File text box, type the name of the file you want to import 
or use the Browse button to locate the file.
 
3. In the Delimiter drop-down list, select the delimiter format you used 
when you saved your file in the native application.
 
 The delimiter options are Tab, Comma, Semicolon, Colon, and Other. 
You should have made this choice when you exported the data from the 
original program in which you created it, such as Excel or Access. If you 

262
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
don’t remember what you chose, you can always go to the original pro-
gram and export the data again. You must select the correct option for 
your data to import correctly.
 
4. Select the table width.
 
 If you choose Fit to Data, Dreamweaver automatically creates the table 
to fit the data being imported. If you choose Set, you must specify a per-
cent or pixel size.
 
5. (Optional) Specify the cell padding and cell spacing only if you want 
extra space around the data in the table to be created.
 
6. (Optional) Choose an option from the Format Top Row drop-down 
list only if you want to format the data in the top row of the table.
 
 Your options are Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic.
 
7. Specify the border size.
 
 The default is 1, which puts a small border around the table. Choose 0 if 
you don’t want the border to be visible. Choose a larger number if you 
want a thicker border.
 
8. Click OK to automatically create a table with the imported data.
Dreamweaver also enables you to export data from a table into a delimited 
format. This capability is useful if you want to export data from a Web page 
so that you can import it into another program, such as Word or Excel, 
or into a database program, such as FileMaker or Access. To export data 
from Dreamweaver, place the cursor anywhere in the table and choose 
File➪Export➪Table. In the Export Table dialog box, choose from the options 
on the Delimiter drop-down list (you can choose Tab, Space, Comma, 
Semicolon, or Colon). From the Line Breaks drop-down list, specify the oper-
ating system (you can choose Windows, Mac, or UNIX).
Using Tables for Spacing and Alignment
Tables have long been used on the Web to create page layouts that require 
more than basic alignment of elements on a page. In the early days of Web 
design, using tables was one of the only ways you could get around many of 
the limitations of basic HTML and accomplish some otherwise impossible 
design feats, such as evenly spacing bullets, creating columns side-by-side on 
a page, and spanning headlines or images across multiple columns.
Today, CSS offers a much better option for these kinds of designs, but many 
people are still using tables and you may have Web sites that you created in 
this way (or you may inherit a design that uses them). If you’re working on a 
site that’s designed with tables to create a page layout for any content that 
isn’t tabular, such as the Chocolate Game Rules page, as shown in Figure 8-9, 

263
 Chapter 8: Coming to the HTML Table
consider redesigning the page layout with <div> tags and CSS, which are 
covered in detail in Chapter 6.
 
Figure 8-9: 
Many 
two-column 
page 
layouts, 
such as the 
one shown 
here, were 
created 
with HTML 
tables.
 
Nesting Tables within Tables
Placing tables within tables, or nested tables, can help you create extremely 
complex designs. For example, with a table that contains scores of all the 
baseball games in a season, you could add a smaller table inside one cell to 
include detailed stats of an exceptional game. You create nested tables by 
inserting a table within a cell of another table. 
 
The best Web designs communicate the information to your audience in the 
most elegant and understandable way and are easy to download. To make 
sure that your designs don’t get too messy, remember these guidelines:
 
✓ A table within a table within a table is nested three levels deep. Anything 
more than that gets hairy.
 
✓ Pages that use nested tables take longer to download because browsers 
have to interpret each table individually before rendering the page. For 
some designs, the slightly longer download time is worth it, but in most 
cases, you’re better off adding or merging cells in one table, as I explain 

264
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
in the section “Merging and splitting table cells,” earlier in this chapter. 
One situation that makes a nested table worth the added download time 
is when you want to place a table of financial or other data in the midst 
of a complex page design.
To place a table inside another table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place the cursor where you want to create the first table.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Table.
 
 The Insert Table dialog box appears.
 
3. Type the number of columns and rows you need for your design.
 
4. Set the Width option to whatever is appropriate for your design and 
then click OK.
 
 The table is sized automatically to the width you set.
 
5. Click to place the cursor in the cell in which you want to place the 
second table.
 
6. Repeat Steps 2–4, specifying the number of columns and rows you 
want and the width of the table.
 
 The new table appears inside the cell of the first table.
 
7. Type the information that you want in the nested table cells as you 
would enter content in any other table.

W
ant to add cool effects like rollovers and pop-up windows? 
Dreamweaver’s behaviors make it easier than ever to create these 
kinds of interactive features with a JavaScript scripting language.
Behaviors are ready-to-use scripts that you can customize to create a variety 
of features. You can apply behaviors to almost any element on an HTML page 
and even to the entire page itself. For example, you can use the Swap Image 
behavior to create an interactive slide show or the Open Browser Window 
behavior to play a video in a small, separate browser window.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Behaviors panel and show you how to 
use some of Dreamweaver’s most popular options.
Brushing Up on Behavior Basics
When you start working with behaviors in Dreamweaver, you can get up and 
running more easily if you start with this basic introduction to how behav-
iors work and the terminology they use. When you set up a behavior, you 
can choose from a number of triggers, or events, such as OnMouseOver or 
OnClick. Consider this slightly corny example: If you tickle someone and 
make the person laugh, you used an event to trigger an action. Dreamweaver 

268
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
would call the tickling the event and the laughter the action. The combination 
is a Dreamweaver behavior.
You may already be familiar with the rollover behavior, when one image is 
switched for another. In a rollover, putting your mouse over an image is the 
event. The action is the switching of the original image for another image, as 
shown in Figure 9-1. Rollovers are common in navigation, and you can create 
one with simple effects that use two images, as long as the images are exactly 
the same size. Alternatively, you can use the Swap Image behavior to create 
much more complex effects, such as causing any or all the images on a page 
to change when any other element is triggered.
 
The rollover behavior used to be a great way to create rollover effects on 
links, but with the advent of CSS, a better option has emerged. The rollover 
behavior is still a cool feature when you want to swap two images, but as you 
learn in Chapter 6, you can now create links with rollover effects using CSS, an 
option that’s more search engine friendly and more accessible to people who 
use screen readers.
 
Figure 9-1: 
When a 
cursor rolls 
over the 
main image 
on this 
page, a sec-
ond image 
of equal size 
is displayed 
in its place.
 
Dreamweaver includes about 20 behaviors, and you can download and install 
more. (You find instructions in the “Installing New Extensions for Behaviors” 
section, at the end of this chapter.)
Creating a Rollover Image
Rollover images, as the name implies, are designed to react when someone 
rolls a cursor over an image. The effect can be as dramatic as a picture of a 
dog being replaced by a picture of a lion, or as subtle as the color of a word 
changing as one image replaces another. Either way, this is one of the most 
common JavaScripts in use on the Web, and it’s such a popular feature that 
Dreamweaver includes a special dialog box just for rollovers.

269
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
In the section that follows, you find instructions for using the Behaviors 
panel, where Dreamweaver stores most of the Behaviors included in the pro-
gram. In this section, you find instructions for using the Insert Rollover Image 
dialog box, which makes creating a simple rollover effect one of the easiest 
behaviors to apply.
 
You can create more complex rollover image effects with the Swap Image 
option from the Behaviors panel. The Swap Image option enables you to 
change multiple images at the same time.
To create a simple rollover effect with Dreamweaver’s Insert Image Rollover 
dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Place your cursor on the page where you want the rollover to appear.
 
 Rollover effects require at least two images: one for the initial state and 
one for the rollover state. You can use two different images or two simi-
lar ones, but both should have the same dimensions. Otherwise, you see 
strange scaling effects because both images must be displayed in exactly 
the same space on the page.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the drop-down list available from the images 
icon in the Insert panel and select Rollover Image.
 
 The Insert Rollover Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Select the 
original and 
rollover 
images.
 
 
3. In the Image Name box, name your image.
 
 Before you can apply a behavior to an element, such as an image, the 
element must have a name so that the behavior script can reference 
it. You can name elements anything you like as long as you don’t use 
spaces or special characters.
 
4. In the Original Image box, specify the first image you want visible. 
Use the Browse button to locate and select the image.

270
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
 If the images aren’t already in your local site folder, Dreamweaver copies 
them into your site when you create the rollover. (If you haven’t already 
set up your site in Dreamweaver, see Chapter 2 for more on this impor-
tant preliminary step.)
 
5. In the Rollover Image box, enter the image you want to become vis-
ible when visitors move their cursors over the first image.
 
 Again, you can use the Browse button to locate and select the image.
 
6. Select the Preload Rollover Image check box to load all rollover 
images into the browser’s cache when the page first loads.
 
 If you don’t choose to do this step, your visitors may experience a delay 
because the second image won’t be downloaded until a mouse is rolled 
over the original image.
 
7. In the When Clicked, Go to URL box, enter any Web address or 
browse to locate another page in your site that you want to link to.
 
 If you don’t specify a URL, Dreamweaver automatically inserts the # sign 
as a placeholder in the code.
 
 The # sign is a common technique for creating links that don’t link any-
where. Because rollover images that don’t link to another page have 
many great uses, this is a useful technique. Just remember that if you do 
want your rollover to link, you need to replace the # sign with a link to 
another page. See Chapter 2 for details about setting links.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The images are set up automatically as a rollover.
 
 
9. Click the globe icon at the top of the workspace to preview your work 
in a browser where you can test how the rollover works.
Peeking at the JavaScript code
JavaScript is the code behind Dreamweaver 
behaviors. Writing JavaScript is more complex 
than writing HTML code, but not as difficult as 
writing in a programming language, such as C# 
or Java. (No, Java and JavaScript aren’t the 
same.) Dreamweaver takes most of the chal-
lenge out of JavaScript by giving you a graphic 
interface that doesn’t require you to write the 
complicated code yourself. When you use 
behaviors, Dreamweaver automatically writes 
the code for you behind the scenes.
To fully appreciate what Dreamweaver can do 
for you, you may want to switch to code view 
after setting up a behavior just to see the com-
plex code required when you use JavaScript. 
If you don’t like what you see, don’t worry: Go 
back to design view and you can continue to 
let Dreamweaver take care of the code for you. 
(I just want you to see how lucky you are that 
Dreamweaver includes these features.)

271
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
Adding Behaviors to a Web Page
Dreamweaver offers a number of behaviors you can choose from, including 
the Swap Image behavior and the Open New Browser Window behavior cov-
ered in detail in the next two sections. The process of adding other behaviors 
is similar to these two, but each behavior has its quirks. The tips and tricks 
you find here can help you get started with behaviors, find out where the 
majority of the behavior features are in the program, and how you match 
behaviors with triggers using the Behaviors panel.
Creating swaps with multiple images
Before you start creating a more complex page design with Dreamweaver’s 
Swap Image behavior, first take a look at the finished page so you can see the 
result before you get into the details. Notice in Figure 9-3 that a collection of 
thumbnail images is on the bottom of the page and a larger version of one of 
those images is displayed in the main area of the page.
 
Figure 9-3: 
When you 
use the 
Swap Image 
behavior, 
you can 
replace any 
or all the 
images on a 
page.
 
Notice in Figure 9-4 that when the page is displayed in a browser and I roll my 
cursor over a different thumbnail image on the bottom, the larger image dis-
played above it changes. With the Swap Image behavior, you can replace any 
or all the images on a page.

272
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
When you use the Swap Image behavior, it’s important to make all of the 
images that you will ‘swap’ the exact same size (height and width).
 
Figure 9-4: 
When you 
preview a 
behavior in 
a browser, 
you can 
see the 
effect of the 
Swap Image 
behavior 
when the 
cursor is 
rolled over 
an image.
 
Follow these steps to use the Swap Image behavior:
 
1. Create a page design with all the images you want displayed initially.
 
 In the page design I created for these photos by Jasper Johal, the initial 
page design includes all thumbnail images positioned on the bottom of 
the page, and the first of the big images displayed in the main area just 
above them.
 
 You can use the Swap Image behavior to change images on any Web 
page no matter how the layout is created. In the design featured in this 
section, I used CSS to create a layout with separate <div> tags for the 
row of thumbnails on the bottom and another <div> tag for the bigger 
image above the thumbnails. These divs are positioned with CSS. (Find 
instructions for creating CSS layouts in Chapter 6.)
 
2. Name your images in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 9-5.
 
 To target your images with JavaScript, which is how behaviors work, first 
give each image a unique ID. The image ID isn’t the same as the image file-
name, although you can use the same or similar names. In this example, 
I gave each thumbnail image an ID that matched the text on the small 
image, to make indentifying the thumbnails easy. You can name images 
anything you like as long as you don’t use spaces or special characters. 
I find it helpful to use names that correspond to the image or its order. 

273
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
Using the same or similar IDs for your images as you use for the image file-
names helps make it easier to match them when you create the behavior.
 
 In contrast, I usually name the main image something simple and distinc-
tive, such as display_photo or mainImage, to make it easier to keep 
track of which image I’m replacing each time.
 
 Although Dreamweaver automatically assigns a name to each image you 
insert into a Web page, I find it easier to keep track when I set up the 
Swap Image behavior if I use names that describe the images or corre-
spond to their order.
 
3. Choose Window➪Behaviors.
 
 The Behaviors panel opens. You can drag the Behaviors panel elsewhere 
on the page, and you can expand it by dragging its bottom or side. You 
may also want to close any other open panels to make more room by 
clicking the dark gray bar at the top of any panel.
 
4. Select an image and choose the Swap Image behavior.
 
 First click to select the image in the page that will serve as the trigger for 
the action. In this example, I’m using the thumbnail images as triggers, 
so I select them one at a time. I started with the fashion thumbnail, but 
because it triggers the image that appears when the page is first 
displayed, I’m going to use the second one as the example here. You 
repeat this same process for each thumbnail.

In the top 
left of the

inspector,

for each

Figure 9-6: 
With a

image 
selected, 
use the 
drop-down 
list in the 
Behaviors 
panel to 
specify an 
action, such 
as Swap 
Image.
 
 
 In the example shown in Figures 9-6 and 9-7, I’ve selected the second 
thumbnail image named yoga. With that trigger image selected in the 
workspace, I then click the Add Behavior arrow in the Behaviors panel 
(the small arrow under the plus sign) to open the drop-down list of 
actions, and then select the action I want to apply. In the example shown 
in Figure 9-6, I selected the Swap Image action, which opens the Swap 
Image dialog box shown in Figure 9-7.
 
5. Specify the images to swap.
 
a. In the Swap Image dialog box, select the ID for the image that 
will be replaced. 
 
 In Figure 9-7, I selected the image with the ID main Image. Note 
that you don’t want to choose the image you selected; you want to 
choose the image you want to replace. In this case I’m replacing 
the main fashion image with the main yoga image using the yoga 
thumbnail as the trigger.
 
b. Click the Browse button to select the image that replaces the 
main image. 

275
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
 I selected the main-yoga.jpg image, which I carefully named to 
correspond to the matching thumbnail, which is named yoga. Now 
when a user rolls a cursor over the yoga thumbnail image, the big 
photo from the fashion gallery will be replaced with the big photo 
from the yoga gallery.
 
 Note: If the image is not already saved in the local site folder, 
Dreamweaver will offer to copy it there for you. 
 
Figure 9-7: 
Use the 
Browse but-
ton to select 
the image 
you want 
to swap.
 
 
6. At the bottom of the Swap Image dialog box, select Preload Images to 
instruct the browser to load all the images into the cache when the 
page is loaded.
 
 If you don’t select this option, a delay may occur when the image swap 
is used.
 
7. Deselect the Restore Images OnMouseOut option if you wish.
 
 The Restore Images OnMouseOut option means that when an event is 
completed (such as the mouse is moved off the triggering thumbnail), 
the original image is replaced. By default, Dreamweaver preselects this 
option for the Swap Image behavior, but in the example shown here, I 
deselect it because I found that replacing the original image each time I 
rolled the cursor over another thumbnail was distracting.
 
8. After you specify all the settings for the behavior, click OK.
 
 The new behavior appears in the Behaviors panel.
 
9. Specify an event for the behavior.
 
 After the action is applied, you can go back and specify which event 
will trigger the action (as shown in Figure 9-8). By default, Dreamweaver 
applies the OnMouseOver event when you use the Swap Image action, 
but you can change that to any available event, such as OnClick, which 
requires that the user click the image to trigger the Swap Image action. 
In this example, I leave it set to OnMouseOver. 

276
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
 The list of Behaviors and Events varies depending on the element 
selected and the applied behavior. For more information about events 
and what each one accomplishes, see the “Choosing an event for a 
behavior” sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter.
 
Figure 9-8: 
When you 
set up a 
behavior, 
you can 
specify any 
available 
action to 
trigger an 
event.
 
 
 You can display or hide events by clicking the Show All Events icon in 
the top left of the Behaviors panel. Note that if you’re using Windows, 
you also see a collection of events that begin with an <a> and are for ele-
ments that are linked.
 
10. Apply additional behaviors.
 
 To apply the Swap Image behavior to other images on a page, repeat 
Steps 5–9, clicking to select the image you want to serve as a trigger and 
then specifying the corresponding image that should be swapped. In 
this example, I selected each of the thumbnails in turn and set up a Swap 
Image behavior that replaced the mainImage with the corresponding 
larger version of the photo in the thumbnail.
 
 For best display, make sure that the images that are swapped, such as 
the large photos shown in the main display area of this site, are all the 
same size.
 
11. Test your work in a browser.
 
 You can’t see the effects of behaviors like this one until you click the 
Live View button at the top of the workspace in Dreamweaver or pre-
view your page in a browser, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer.

277
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
Using the Open Browser Window behavior
You can use behaviors in Dreamweaver to create many interactive features, 
such as opening a new browser window when someone clicks a link. As you 
can see in Figure 9-9, this is a great way to make supplemental information 
Choosing an event for a behavior
Events, in interactive Web-speak, are things 
a user does to trigger a behavior or an action 
in a Web page. Clicking an image is an event, 
as is loading a page into a browser or pressing 
a key on the keyboard. Different browser ver-
sions support different events (the more recent 
the browser, the more events available). Some 
events are available only for certain kinds of 
objects or behaviors. If an event can’t be used 
with a selected element or behavior, it appears 
dimmed. This list describes the most common 
events:
 ✓ onBlur: Triggered when the specified 
element stops being the focus of user inter-
action. For example, when a user clicks 
outside a text field after clicking in the text 
field, the browser generates an onBlur 
event for the text field. onBlur is the 
opposite of onFocus.
 ✓ onClick: Triggered when the user clicks 
an element, such as a link, a button, or an 
image.
 ✓ onDblClick: Triggered when the user 
double-clicks the specified element.
 ✓ onError: Triggered when a browser error 
occurs while a page or an image is load-
ing. This event can be caused, for example, 
when an image or a URL can’t be found on 
the server.
 ✓ onFocus: Triggered when the specified 
element becomes the focus of user interac-
tion. For example, clicking in or tabbing to a 
text field of a form generates an onFocus 
event.
 ✓ onKeyDown: Triggered as soon as the 
user presses any key on the keyboard. (The 
user doesn’t have to release the key for this 
event to be generated.)
 ✓ onKeyPress: Triggered when the user 
presses and releases any key on the key-
board. This event is like a combination of 
the onKeyDown and onKeyUp events.
 ✓ onKeyUp: Triggered when the user 
releases a key on the keyboard after press-
ing it.
 ✓ onLoad: Triggered when an image or the 
entire page finishes loading.
 ✓ onMouseDown: Triggered when the 
user presses the mouse button. (The user 
doesn’t have to release the mouse button 
to generate this event.)
 ✓ onMouseMove: Triggered when the user 
moves the mouse while pointing to the 
specified element and the pointer doesn’t 
move away from the element (stays within 
its boundaries).
 ✓ onMouseOut: Triggered when the pointer 
moves off the specified element (usually a 
link).
 ✓ onMouseOver: Triggered when the 
mouse pointer moves over the specified 
element. Opposite of onMouseOut.
 ✓ onMouseUp: Triggered when a mouse 
button that’s been pressed is released.

278
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
available without losing the original page a visitor was viewing. The Open 
Browser Window behavior enables you to specify the size of the new window 
and to display it over the existing window.
 
Figure 9-9: 
A larger 
version of 
the photo 
of pilgrims 
crossing 
the Ganges 
River is 
displayed 
in a new 
browser 
window 
when a user 
clicks the 
thumbnail 
version of 
the image.
 
To add the Open Browser Window behavior to a selected image (or any other 
element) on a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Create the page that will open in the new browser window.
 
 For this example, I created a new blank HTML page and inserted a larger 
version of the image that corresponds to the thumbnail I’ll be using as a 
trigger. The goal is that when a user clicks the trigger image, a browser 
window will open that is sized exactly to fit the larger image but much 
smaller than the full browser window.
 
 When you name files that will be used in behaviors, such as a page that 
will open when the Open Browser Window behavior is used, avoid using 
slashes anywhere in a filename or numbers at the beginning of a file-
name (you can use numbers anywhere else in the name). You can use 
hyphens and underscores.
 
2. Select the image, text, or other element you want to serve as the trig-
ger for the action.
 
 You can select any image, text, or other element on a page and apply a 
behavior to it the same way.
 
3. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.

279
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
4. Click the plus sign (+) and choose the behavior you want from the 
drop-down list.
 
 In this example, I selected the Open Browser Window behavior.
 
 If a behavior appears dimmed, it can’t be associated with the selected 
element. For example, the Swap Image behavior can be applied only 
to an image, so it appears dimmed if you’ve selected text or another 
element.
 
5. In the Open Browser Window dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-10, 
specify the settings.
 
 You can set a number of options that control how the new browser 
window appears:
 
• Use the Browse button to the right of the URL to Display box to 
select the page you want to open in the new browser window. 
(You can also enter a URL in this box to open a page in another 
Web site.)
 
• Set the window width and height to specify the exact pixel size 
of the new browser window that will open. In this example, I set 
the width to the exact size of the image.
 
• Select the options Navigation Toolbar, Location Toolbar, Status 
Bar, Menu Bar, Scrollbars as Needed, or Resize Handles if you 
want the new browser window to include any of these features. I 
selected Scrollbars as Needed in case my visitor’s browser window 
is smaller than the size I specified for the photo, but I left all the 
others deselected because I want a clean, simple browser window 
without any menus or other features.
 
• Name the new window, which is important if you want to target 
that same window to load other pages into it.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Specify set-
tings for the 
display of 
the window.
 

280
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
6. After you specify all the settings for the behavior, click OK.
 
 The new behavior appears in the Behaviors panel.
 
7. To change the event that triggers your behavior, select the current 
event from the left side of the Behaviors panel.
 
 In the Events drop-down list, select any available event to serve as the 
trigger for the behavior. For more information about events and what 
each one accomplishes, see the “Choosing an event for a behavior” side-
bar, elsewhere in this chapter.
 
8. To test the action, choose File➪Preview in Browser.
 
 Click the image to test whether a new browser window opens.
Attaching Multiple Behaviors
You can attach multiple behaviors to the same element on a page (as long as 
they don’t conflict, of course). For example, you can attach one action that’s 
triggered when users click an image and another when they move their cur-
sors over the image. You can also trigger the same action by using multiple 
events. For example, you can open the same page in a new browser window 
when a user triggers any number of events.
To attach additional behaviors to an element, click the plus sign in the 
Behaviors panel and select another option from the pop-up list. Repeat this 
process as many times as you want.
Editing a Behavior
You can always go back and edit a behavior after you create it. You can 
choose a different event to trigger the behavior, choose a different action, or 
remove behaviors. You can also change behavior options after a behavior is 
applied.
To edit a behavior, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object with a behavior attached.
 
2. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
 
 Here are some options you can choose in the Behaviors panel:
 
• Change a triggering event: Choose a different event in the Events 
drop-down list in the Behaviors panel.

281
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
• Remove a behavior: Click the action in the Behaviors panel to 
select it and then click the minus sign at the top of the pane. The 
behavior disappears.
 
• Change parameters for an action: Double-click the gear icon next 
to the action and change the parameters in the dialog box that 
opens.
 
• Change the order of actions when multiple actions are set: Select 
an action and then click the Move Event Value Up or Move Event 
Value Down buttons to move the action to a different position in 
the list of actions.
Installing New Extensions for Behaviors
Even with all the cool features in Dreamweaver, a day will almost certainly 
come when you’ll want to do things that Dreamweaver can’t do with the fea-
tures that shipped with the program. Fortunately, the programmers who cre-
ated Dreamweaver made it possible for other programmers to add features 
with the Extension Manager. The result? You can add new functionality by 
adding extensions from a variety of third-party sources.
You can find extensions that do everything from adding highly customizable 
drop-down and fly-out menus to full-featured shopping cart systems. Keep 
in mind, however, that not all extensions are well supported and few come 
with good instructions. They’re not all free, either. Some cost hundreds of 
dollars, but most are in the $20–$50 range. When you visit the Dreamweaver 
Exchange site, you find reviews and rankings to help you sort through the 
best options.
In the following steps, I explain how you find, download, and install a free 
Dreamweaver extension. Although how extensions work after they’re 
installed can differ dramatically, the basic process of adding them to 
Dreamweaver is nearly the same.
 
1. Visit the Dreamweaver Exchange site.
 
 Get to the Dreamweaver Exchange site by
 
• Choosing Get More Behaviors from the bottom of the Behaviors 
drop-down list in the Behaviors panel.
 
• Visiting www.adobe.com/exchange and following the link to the 
Dreamweaver section.
 
• Clicking the link in the bottom right of the Dreamweaver Welcome 
screen.

282
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
 Note: If you launch Dreamweaver and find a link to download an update 
for Dreamweaver instead of the link to the Exchange site, by all means 
download and install the update first. After you’re finished, the update 
link is replaced by the link to the Exchange site.
 
2. Sort through the many available extensions.
 
 You’ll find a wide range of extensions on the Dreamweaver Exchange 
site. You can search through extensions by category, keyword, and 
ranking options. Many of the extensions featured on the Exchange site 
include links to their creators’ sites, where you’ll often find even more 
extensions.
 
3. Select an extension and review its features.
 
 When you click a link to an extension on the Exchange site, you’ll find 
more information about the extension, including system requirements 
and the version of Dreamweaver that the extension was designed for. 
In general, you can use extensions designed for earlier versions of 
Dreamweaver in more recent versions. Be aware, however, that exten-
sions designed for later versions of Dreamweaver usually won’t work in 
earlier versions of the program.
 
 Before you leave the extension’s page, I highly recommend that you take 
the time to read the special instructions in the middle of the page.
 
 Some extensions include important instructions, such as where you find 
the new feature in the Dreamweaver interface after it’s installed and 
warnings that some functionality of an extension will work only when 
previewed on a live Web server (this is true for the random image exten-
sion, for example).
 
4. To download an extension, click the Download button (for free exten-
sions) or the Buy button next to the extension name and save the 
extension to your hard drive.
 
5. Install the new extension after it’s downloaded by choosing Help➪
Manage Extensions to open the installation dialog box.
 
 Most extensions require that you close Dreamweaver before installation, 
and most install with the click of a button. Dreamweaver’s Extension 
Manager launches automatically to install most extensions.
 
6. In the Extension Manager dialog box, choose File➪Install Extension and 
then browse your drive to select the extension file you downloaded.
 
 After the installation is complete, Dreamweaver displays instructions 
for using the extension. These are usually the same as the instructions 
included in the middle of the page on the Exchange site.

283
 Chapter 9: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
 Pay special attention to the part of the instructions that tells you where 
you’ll find your newly installed extensions. Extensions may be added to 
menus, dialog boxes, and other parts of Dreamweaver depending on 
their functionality and how the programmer set them up. Finding them 
can be hard if you don’t know where to look.
 
7. Launch Dreamweaver and find the new menu option, button, or other 
interface feature that controls your new extension.
 
 In many cases, all you have to do is open an existing page or create a 
new page in Dreamweaver and then open the newly added dialog box or 
select the new option from a menu.
 
Adobe is constantly updating the Exchange site available by clicking the 
Dreamweaver link at www.adobe.com/exchange. Visit it regularly to find 
new extensions you can download and install to enhance Dreamweaver’s fea-
ture set.

G
et your Web pages singing and dancing with multimedia. Audio, video, 
and animation are exploding on the Web and transforming static pages 
into rich multimedia experiences. You can use Dreamweaver to link to mul-
timedia files, or you can insert audio, video, and other files so that they play 
within your pages. You can even control when and how they play for your 
users.
Not all Web sites warrant multimedia; if your goal is to provide information 
in the fastest way possible to the broadest audience, text is still generally 
the best option. If you want to provide a richer experience for your users, 
to show rather than just tell, or to entertain as well as inform, adding audio, 
video, and animation can help you share more information more vividly and 
even make you look more professional.
The most complicated aspect of multimedia on the Web is choosing the 
best format for your audience, which is why you’ll find a primer on audio 
and video formats in this chapter. You can’t create or edit multimedia files 
in Dreamweaver. (You’ll need a video or audio editing software program for 
that.) But after your files are ready, Dreamweaver makes adding them to your 
Web pages relatively easy.
As you discover in this chapter, inserting video, audio, and Flash files is simi-
lar to adding image files to Web pages, but with many more options, such as 
settings that control whether a video starts automatically or whether a user 
has to click the play button before it begins.

286
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
Many people surf the Web in their offices, in libraries, and in other locations 
where unexpected sound can be jarring, disruptive, or worse. Always give 
people a warning before you play video or audio and always give users a way 
to turn audio off quickly when necessary.
In this chapter, you also find instructions for using third-party services, such 
as YouTube or Vimeo, to host videos. With this approach, you upload your 
video to YouTube, Vimeo, or another service and then use Dreamweaver to 
add a snippet of code into your site so that the video plays on your page (even 
though it’s hosted elsewhere). An advantage of this approach is that YouTube 
and other video sites are better at delivering video on the Web than most of 
the commercial Web servers that you’re likely to use to host your site. 
Understanding Multimedia Players
When you add sound, video, or any other kind of multimedia to a Web site, 
your visitors may need a special player (sometimes with an associated plug-
in) to play or view your files.
Players are small programs that work alone or with a Web browser to add 
support for functions, such as playing sound, video, and animation files. 
Some of the best-known multimedia players are the Flash Player, Windows 
Media Player, and Apple QuickTime.
The challenge is that not everyone on the Web uses the same player, and 
viewers must have the correct player to view your multimedia files. As a 
result, you need a strategy that helps visitors play your multimedia easily, 
such as the following ones:
 
✓ Many Web developers offer audio and video in two or three formats so 
users can choose the one that best fits the players they already have.
 
✓ Some developers also include the same multimedia files in different file 
sizes so that visitors with slower connection speeds don’t have to wait 
as long. Optimizing multimedia for the Web works much as it does with 
images: The smaller the file size, the lower the quality but the faster the 
file downloads.
 
✓ Many Web developers also include information about how visitors can 
download and install the best player if they need it to view the files.
 
✓ Increasingly, Web developers are using third-party services, such as 
YouTube or Vimeo, to host videos. You find instructions for using these 
services toward the end of this chapter.
You can use Dreamweaver to insert or link to any type of multimedia file, 
but only you can choose the format that’s best for your audience. Although 

287
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
dozens of plug-ins are available for Web pages, the most common plug-ins on 
the Web today are Flash, Windows Media, and QuickTime.
In general, I recommend that you avoid the more obscure players unless 
you’re offering specialized content that users have a good reason to down-
load, such as a three-dimensional game that requires a special program 
to run.
Working with Adobe Flash
Adobe Flash is a favorite among Web designers because it’s well supported 
on the Web (more than 90% of Internet users already have the Flash plug-in), 
and because you can use it to create audio files, videos, and animations. 
Dreamweaver supports both of the popular Flash file types:
 
✓ Flash files: (extension .swf) The most versatile Flash format is the 
SWF file (pronounced SWIFF). Often referred to simply as Flash files, 
this format is sometimes called a Flash movie, even when it doesn’t 
include video. Flash files with a .swf extension can include illustra-
tions, photos, animation sequences, and video. In Dreamweaver, choose 
Insert➪Media➪SWF for this format. You find detailed instructions for 
working with this type of Flash file in the following section.
 
✓ Flash video: (extension .flv) As the name implies, Flash video is a 
video format, although it can also be used for audio files. To convert 
video into the Flash video format, you need the Flash Video Encoder. 
In Dreamweaver, use the Insert➪Media➪FLV option for this format. 
You find detailed instructions for working with .flv Flash files in the 
“Adding Flash audio and video files” section later in this chapter. 
One thing that makes Flash files (with the .swf extension) so flexible and 
so fast on the Internet is that Flash uses vector graphics instead of bitmaps. 
Therefore, the graphics in Flash are based on mathematical descriptions 
(vectors) instead of dots (bitmaps), and those vector equations take up far 
less space than bitmapped images. Vector graphics can also be scaled up 
or down in size without affecting the image quality or the size of the down-
loaded file. This ability to scale makes Flash ideally suited for the many dif-
ferent monitor sizes that Web viewers use as well as for the tiny displays on 
cell phones and other handheld devices. You can even project Flash graphics 
on a wall or movie screen without losing quality, although any photographs 
or video files integrated into a Flash file may lose quality or look distorted at 
higher or lower resolutions.

288
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
To create a Flash file, you need Adobe Flash or a similar program that sup-
ports the Flash format. Because Flash is an open standard, you can create 
Flash files with a variety of programs, including Adobe Illustrator, which has 
an Export to SWF option. If want to know how to create full-featured Flash 
files, check out Adobe Flash CS5 For Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein and Gurdy 
Leete. 
 
Flash is great overall, but be aware of these important drawbacks:
 
✓ Flash is not supported by most mobile phone browsers, including the 
iPhone. As a result, if you try to view a site created with Flash on a 
mobile phone, you see only blank screen. To get around this problem, 
more and more Web designers are creating a second version of their 
Flash sites designed for mobile phones and linking it to their main site.
 
✓ If you need printouts for some reason, Flash may not print as well as you 
would hope.
 
✓ Flash may cause accessibility problems. Screen readers and other 
specialized viewers can’t read the text in a Flash file any better than 
they can read text in an image file. To make Flash files more accessible, 
include detailed alternative text.
 
✓ Flash sites are generally more complicated to edit or update than sites 
created using HTML and CSS.
 
✓ Search engines may not read text in Flash files, which can hurt your 
page ranking in search results (although including alternative text can 
help with this limitation and Google is improving its ability to index flash 
pages).
 
✓ Sites created entirely in Flash are harder to link to, especially if you want 
to link to a particular page within a site and not just to the front page of 
the site. Similarly, it’s harder (or impossible) to bookmark specific pages 
within a site designed with Flash.
Inserting Flash SWF files
Flash files, often called Flash movies, use the .swf extension and can include 
animations, graphics, photos, and even video. Thanks to Dreamweaver, these 
files are relatively easy to insert into a Web page. In this section, I assume 
you have a completed Flash file (an animation or other Flash movie), and you 
want to add it to your Web page.
You insert a Flash file much as you insert an image file. But because Flash 
can do so much more than a still image, you have a variety of settings and 
options for controlling how your Flash file plays.

289
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
Before you start, make sure to save the Flash file you want to insert in the 
main folder for your Web site (that is, the local site folder you set up, as I 
explain in Chapter 2). I recommend creating a multimedia subfolder in your 
main Web site folder for audio and other multimedia files, just as most design-
ers create an image folder for image files.
To add a Flash file to a Web site, open an existing page or create a new docu-
ment and save the file. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Click where you want the Flash file to appear on your Web page.
 
2. If it’s not already open, choose Window➪Insert and then use the drop-
down list to select the Common Insert panel.
 
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert panel, choose 
the SWF Flash option (see Figure 10-1).
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Media➪SWF. The Select File dialog box 
appears.
 
4. Browse to locate the Flash file that you want to insert in your page 
and click to select the file.
 
5. If you have accessibility options turned on, you’re prompted to add 
alternative text to describe the Flash file. Enter a description of the 
file and click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the Flash file is inserted into your document.
 
Dreamweaver displays Flash as a gray box with the dimensions of the Flash 
file. To display the Flash file as it will appear in a Web browser with the Flash 
player, click to select it and then click the green Play button on the right side 
of the Property inspector. (In Figure 10-2, you see the Stop button because I’ve 
already clicked the Play button, which changed to the Stop button when the 
file began playing.) If you have the Flash player installed on your computer, 
the Flash file will also play when you preview the page in a browser.
Setting Flash properties
Like most HTML tags, the tags that link Flash and other multimedia files to 
Web pages have attributes (also called properties) that define how a file is 
displayed within a browser, controlling such actions as whether an anima-
tion plays automatically when a page is loaded or whether a visitor must 
click a link for the animation to begin. Dreamweaver automatically sets some 
of these options, such as the height and width of the Flash file, but you may 
want to specify others.

To display Flash attributes in the Property inspector, click to select the gray 
box that represents a Flash file after it’s inserted into a Web page. The follow-
ing describes the Flash options included in the Property inspector, as shown 
in Figure 10-2.
 
If you don’t see all the options in the Property inspector, click the expander 
arrow in the lower-right corner to display the more advanced options.
 
✓ ID field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Property 
inspector, just to the right of the Flash icon, to assign a name to the file 
(in Figures 10-1 and 10-2, I’ve named the Flash file fish). You can enter 
any name; just don’t use any spaces or special characters other than 
the dash or underscore. The name is important if you want to refer to 
the file in JavaScript or other programming, but you can leave this field 
blank if you are not using a script with your Flash file.
 
✓ W (width): Use this option to specify the width of the file. The file is 
measured in pixels.
 
✓ H (height): Use this option to specify the height of the file. The file is 
measured in pixels.
 
✓ Reset Size: (This icon is only visible if you have changed the size of a 
Flash file.) You can change the display size of a Flash file by clicking a 
corner and dragging it or by entering a number in the height or width 
fields. When the size of a Flash file has been altered, a small, circular 

291
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
icon appears just to the right of the height and width fields. Clicking 
this circular icon reverts the Flash file to its original size. You can resize 
Flash files, unlike images, video, and many other file types, without 
affecting image quality because they’re vector-based. To keep the file 
proportionate, hold down the Shift key while you drag to resize the file.
 
Figure 10-2:

✓ File: Dreamweaver automatically fills in this field when you insert a 
Flash file with the filename and path. You risk breaking the link to your 
flash file if you alter this field.
 
✓ BG: Click the color swatch to change the Background Color that appears 
behind the Flash file, or enter any hexadecimal color code, starting with 
the pound (#) sign.
 
✓ Edit: Click this button to open a Flash source file with the Adobe Flash 
program where you can edit it. Note that you can edit only the source 
Flash file. After saving the Flash file for Web use with the .swf exten-
sion, return to the original Flash file to edit it again.
 
✓ Class: Use this drop-down list to apply any class styles defined for the 
document.
 
✓ Loop: Selecting this box causes the Flash file to repeat (or loop). If you 
don’t select this box, the Flash movie stops after it reaches the last frame.
 
✓ Autoplay: Selecting this box causes the Flash movie to play as soon as it 
downloads to the viewer’s computer. If you don’t select this box, what-
ever option you’ve set within the Flash file itself (such as onMouseOver 
or onMouseDown) is required to start the movie.
 
✓ V Space (vertical space): If you want blank space above or below the 
file, enter the number of pixels.
 
✓ H Space (horizontal space): If you want blank space on either side of the 
file, enter the number of pixels.
 
✓ Quality: This option enables you to prioritize the anti-aliasing options 
of your images versus the speed of playback. Anti-aliasing, which makes 
your files appear smoother, can slow down the rendering of each frame 
because the computer must first smooth the edges. The Quality 

292
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
parameter enables you to regulate how much the process is slowed by 
letting you set priorities based on the importance of appearance versus 
playback speed. You can choose from these Quality options:
 
• Low: Anti-aliasing is never used. Playback speed has priority over 
appearance.
 
• High: Anti-aliasing is always used. Appearance has priority over 
playback speed.
 
• Auto High: With this option, playback is set to begin with anti-
aliasing turned on. However, if the frame rate supported by the 
user’s computer drops too low, anti-aliasing automatically turns 
off to improve playback speed. This option emphasizes playback 
speed and appearance equally at first but sacrifices appearance for 
the sake of playback speed, if necessary.
 
• Auto Low: Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned off. If the Flash 
player detects that the processor can handle it, anti-aliasing is 
turned on. Use this option to emphasize speed at first but improve 
appearance whenever possible.
 
✓ Scale: Specify this option only if you change the file’s original height 
and width size settings. The Scale parameter enables you to define how 
the Flash movie appears within those settings. The following options in 
the Scale drop-down list enable you to set preferences for how a scaled 
Flash movie appears within the window:
 
• Default (show all): This option enables the entire movie to appear 
in the specified area. The width and height proportions of the orig-
inal movie are maintained and no distortion occurs, but borders 
may appear on two sides of the movie to fill the space.
 
• No Border: This option enables you to scale a Flash movie to fill a 
specified area. No borders appear and the original aspect ratio is 
maintained, but some cropping may occur.
 
• Exact Fit: The Flash movie is the exact width and height that are 
set. However, the original aspect ratio may not be maintained, and 
the movie may look squished.
 
✓ Align: This option controls the alignment of the file on the page. This 
setting works the same for plug-in files as for images.
 
✓ Wmode: Choose the Window option to display the Flash file in a rect-
angular window on a Web page. Choose Opaque to hide everything 
behind a Flash file when you move or resize it using JavaScript. Choose 
Transparent to show the background of the HTML page though any 
transparent portions of the Flash file.
 
✓ Play button: Click the green Play button to play a Flash file in 
Dreamweaver. Note that when the Play button is activated, the button 
changes to Stop (refer to Figure 10-2).

293
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
✓ Parameters: This button provides access to a dialog box where you can 
enter parameters specific to your Flash files.
Using scripts to make Flash function better
When you insert Flash or other multimedia files with Dreamweaver, the pro-
gram creates a collection of JavaScript files that help the Flash file play prop-
erly. The files are named things like, AC_RunActiveContent.js, and are 
stored in a Scripts folder, which Dreamweaver automatically creates inside 
your local site folder. The first time Dreamweaver creates this file, a dialog 
box alerts you that you need to upload the script for your multimedia file to 
work properly. Make sure you include this script when you publish your site 
on your Web server.
If you don’t include the script, your multimedia file may not play properly, 
or your visitors may be required to click the play button twice before the file 
begins to play.
 
With each new version of Dreamweaver, Adobe has changed the scripts 
included with Flash and other multimedia files. If you’re editing a site that was 
created with an earlier version of Dreamweaver, it’s a good idea to update 
these scripts by deleting and then reinserting the multimedia file to generate 
new scripts. Then, make sure you upload the page with the Flash or other mul-
timedia file, as well as the Scripts folder.
Finding Flash resources online
One of the best places to read more about cre-
ating Flash files is on the Internet, where a wide 
range of Web sites offers everything from pre-
designed Flash files you can easily customize to 
great ideas for getting the most from this award-
winning technology. You may find these Web sites 
useful if you want to find out more about Flash:
 ✓ Adobe (www.adobe.com): You find loads 
of tips and tricks for creating and using 
Flash files (as well as many inspiring exam-
ples of Flash in action).

Working with Video and Audio on the Web
As bandwidth has grown on the Web, the use of video files has grown more 
dramatically than almost any other multimedia file type. From YouTube to 
small personal Web sites, millions of video files are added to the Web every 
day. Adding a video file to a Web page with Dreamweaver is relatively easy, 
especially if you use the Flash video format described in the “Adding Flash 
audio and video files” section later in this chapter.
If you use another video format, such as Windows Media Video or QuickTime, 
you find instructions for adding files in those formats in the section, “Inserting 
audio and video files” also later in this chapter. You can specify video and 
audio settings, such as Autoplay, by changing setting parameters, an option 
that is a little more complicated if you use any format other than Flash video. 
You find instructions for managing these settings in Dreamweaver in the 
“Setting options for audio and video files,” later in this chapter.
 
Instead of hosting your video on your own Web server, an alternative is to 
upload video files to YouTube, Vimeo, or another video site and then include 
special code from that site in the HTML code of your Web pages so that the 
video plays within your pages, even though it’s hosted on YouTube. You find 
instructions for using these kinds of services in the section “Using YouTube 
and Other Services to Host Videos,” later in this chapter.
The first challenge to working with multimedia is choosing the right format 
and optimizing your video so it downloads quickly and still looks good. 
Unfortunately, no single video format works perfectly for everyone on the 
Web, but most new computers come with preinstalled video and audio 
players that play the most common file formats. If you use a Windows com-
puter, you probably have Windows Media Player. If you use a Mac, you have 
QuickTime. Both video players can handle multiple video formats, so anyone 
with a relatively new computer can likely view video in common formats.
Streaming media plays faster
To stream multimedia means to play a file while 
it’s downloading from the server. This is a valu-
able trick on the Web because video and audio 
files can take a long time to download. Here’s 
how streaming works. When you click a link to 
a video file, your computer begins to download 
it from the server. If the video is hosted on a 
Web server that supports streaming, the video 
or audio file begins to play as soon as enough 
of the file downloads successfully to ensure an 
uninterrupted experience. 
If you don’t use streaming, the entire file may 
have to download before the media can play. 
Although the download time for streaming or 
nonstreaming files may be the same, streaming 
can greatly reduce the time your visitors wait 
before they can start viewing a video online. 

295
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
Comparing popular video formats
You can convert video from one file format to another relatively easily with 
most video-editing programs. You can open a video in AVI (Audio Video 
Interleave) format in a program, such as Adobe Premier Elements (a good 
video editor for beginners), and then choose File➪Export to convert it to any 
of a dozen formatting and compression options. For example, you could con-
vert an AVI file to the Windows Media format with the compression setting 
for a 56K modem or into the QuickTime format with the compression setting 
for a cable modem. 
Editing video can get complicated, and optimizing video for the best qual-
ity with the fastest download time is both an art and a science, but the most 
basic process of converting a video file isn’t difficult after you understand 
the conversion options. Because Flash video is increasingly popular and 
because the Flash video encoder is included most of the CS Adobe program 
suites, I’ve included basic instructions for using the encoder in the section, 
“Converting video files into Flash format with the Flash video encoder,” later 
in this chapter.
The following sections provide a brief description of the most common digi-
tal video formats, their file extensions, and a Web address where you can find 
out more about each option.
Flash video
You can create Flash videos with Adobe Flash. Because the Flash player is so 
popular on the Web, many developers consider Flash one of the best options 
available today.
File extension: .flv
Web site: www.adobe.com
Because Web servers that stream video are 
very expensive (part of why more and more 
people are hosting their videos on sites like 
YouTube or Vimeo, covered later in this chap-
ter), Flash offers an option called Progressive 
Download. This option offers many of the same 
advantages of streaming because a video 
embedded with the Progressive setting will start 
playing before the entire file is downloaded, 
but there are some limitations. For example, 
you can’t fast forward or back up as well with 
a video that is downloading using Progressive 
settings as you can with a video that is hosted 
on a Web server that supports streaming.

296
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
MP4
Part of MPEG-4, the MP4 format can be used for audio or video. This format is 
becoming increasingly popular, in part, because most mobile phones, includ-
ing the iPhone, support it, making it a good alternative to.flv.
File extension: .mp4
Web site: No official site for this technology
Windows Media Video
Defined by Microsoft and popular on the PC, this video format supports 
streaming and plays with Windows Media Player as well as many other popu-
lar players.
File extension: .wmv
Web site: www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
QuickTime
The QuickTime player is built into the Macintosh operating system and is 
used by most Mac programs that include video or animation. QuickTime is a 
great format for video on the Web and supports streaming, but it’s used pri-
marily by those who favor Macs (although QuickTime files can be viewed on 
Windows computers as well).
File extension: .qt, .mov
Web site: www.quicktime.com
AVI
Created by Microsoft, AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is one the most common 
video formats on Windows computers and can play on most common video 
players. AVI is fine if you’re viewing video on a CD or on your hard drive, 
where the file doesn’t have to download, but you can’t optimize AVI files 
well for use on the Internet. If your files are in AVI, convert them to one of 
the other formats before adding them to your Web site. Otherwise, you force 
your visitors to download unnecessarily large video files.
File extension: .avi
Web site: No one site about AVI exists, but you can find information if 
you search for AVI at www.microsoft.com.

297
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
Comparing popular audio formats
Audio works much like video on the Web. You can link to a sound file or 
embed the file into your page; either way, your visitors need to have the right 
player to listen to the file. You find instructions for adding both audio and 
video files to your pages in the following section, “Adding Audio and Video 
Files to Web Pages.”
The following sections provide a brief description of the most common digi-
tal audio formats, their file extensions, and a Web address where you can find 
out more about each option.
MP3
One of the most successful audio compression formats, MP3 supports 
streaming audio. Most music you can download from the Internet is in MP3 
format, and it’s clearly the first choice of many Web developers. Most popu-
lar multimedia players on the Web can play MP3 files.
File extension: .mp3
Web site: No official site for this technology
Windows Audio
Microsoft’s Windows Audio format supports streaming and can be played 
with Windows Media Player as well as many other popular players. It also 
offers digital rights management functionality.
File extension: .wma
Web site: www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
WAV
The WAV file format is popular in digital media because it offers the highest 
sound quality possible. Audio files in this format are often too big for use on 
the Web, averaging 10MB for a minute of audio. (In comparison, an MP3 file 
that is five times longer can be less than one-third the size.) Although WAV 
files are commonly used on the Internet because of their nearly universal 
compatibility, I recommend that you convert WAV files (especially for long 
audio clips) to one of the other audio formats.
File extension: .wav
Web site: No official Web site exists for WAV files, but you can find some 
documentation at www.microsoft.com when you search for WAV.

Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Adding Audio and Video 
Files to Web Pages
Like other multimedia files, you can link to an audio or a video file or you can 
insert multimedia files into a page. Linking to a multimedia file is as easy as 
linking to any other file, as you see in the instructions that follow. Inserting 
an audio or a video file is a little more complicated, but it lets a visitor play 
the file without leaving the Web page. Inserting audio and video files is cov-
ered in this section. If you’re using Flash video or audio, see the “Adding 
Flash audio and video files” section, later in this chapter.
Linking to audio and video files
To use Dreamweaver to link to a video file, an audio file, or another multime-
dia file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to select the text, image, or other element you want to use to 
create a link.
 
 If you’re linking to a video file, a good trick is to take a single still image 
from the video and insert that into your Web page. Then create a link 
from that image to the video file.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Hyperlink or click the Hyperlink icon in the Common 
Insert panel.
 
 The Hyperlink dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Browse button just to the right of the 
Link field in the Property inspector. (The Browse button looks like a 
small file folder.)
 
Figure 10-3: 
Link to an 
audio or a 
video file 
just as you’d 
create a link 
to another 
Web page.
 

299
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
3. Enter the text you want to serve as a link in the Text field.
 
 If you selected a section of text on the page before opening the 
Hyperlink dialog box, that text automatically appears in the Text field.
 
4. Enter the URL where the audio or video file is located.
 
 Alternatively, click the Browse button (the small file folder icon) to the 
right of the Link field and browse your hard drive to find the video or 
audio file you want to link to.
 
 As with any other file you link to, make sure you’ve saved your audio or 
video files into your local site folder (which I explain how to set up in 
Chapter 2).
 
 Note that you can link to an audio or video file on another Web site, as 
I’ve done in the example shown in Figure 10-3, but you need to have the 
exact URL of the file’s location.
 
5. Click to select the file you want to link to and then click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the link is created automatically.
 
6. (Optional) Choose blank from the Target drop-down list if you want 
the video file to open in a new browser window or tab.
 
7. To specify Accessibility settings, enter a Title, Access Key, and Tab 
Index.
 
8. Click OK to add the hyperlink and to close the Hyperlink dialog box.
 
 
9. Click the Preview button (at the top of the work area) to open the page 
in a browser, where you can test the link to your multimedia file.
 
 
 Dreamweaver launches your specified Web browser and displays the 
page. If you have the necessary player, the file downloads, your player 
launches, and your file automatically plays.
 
Many people like to have multimedia files, such as video, pop up in a new 
browser window. To do this, create an HTML file and embed your multimedia 
file in it. Then use the Open Browser Window behavior in Dreamweaver to 
create a pop-up window that displays your multimedia page. For more on how 
to work with Dreamweaver behaviors, see Chapter 9.
Inserting audio and video files
When you insert an audio or a video file into a Web page, you can set the 
file to play automatically when the page loads (as long as your visitor has 
the necessary player), or you can require that your visitors click the Play 
button first. I recommend the second option. I like to give users control over 

300
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
when and how a video plays because I never want to get anyone in trouble if 
they’re surfing the Web in an office or library where unexpected audio can be 
a problem.
Whether or not you set the file to play automatically, the advantage of 
embedding it into the page is that file will play within your Web page instead 
of opening in a separate window or player.
To use Dreamweaver to embed an audio or a video file into a Web page, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click where you want the file to appear on your Web page.
 
2. Select Common from the Insert panel, and in the Media drop-down 
list, choose Plugin (see Figure 10-4).
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Media➪Plugin. The Select File dialog box 
appears.
 
 Use the Plugin option for all audio and video file types — except Flash 
video (.flv) files, covered in the next section.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Use the 
Plugin 
option to 
insert any 
audio or 
video file 
that isn’t 
saved in 
the Flash 
format.
 
 
3. Browse your hard drive to locate the sound or video file you want 
inserted in your page and then click to select it.

301
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the file is inserted automatically into the 
page. A small plug-in icon (resembling a puzzle piece) represents the 
file.
 
 When you add audio or video, Dreamweaver doesn’t automatically 
determine the height and width of the file, so you need to add the dimen-
sions in the Property inspector after you insert the file. You can gener-
ally find the dimensions of a video file by opening it in a video-editing 
program and looking for the height and width, but it’s often not neces-
sary. You can set the height and width in Dreamweaver to whatever you 
want, irrespective of the video’s actual dimensions, but the video may 
be distorted or lack quality if you make it much bigger than its actual 
size or fail to maintain its proportions. After you set the height and 
width in the Property inspector, the plug-in icon changes to reflect the 
specified size.
 
5. Click the plug-in icon that represents the file in the Web page to 
display the file options in the Property inspector and specify your 
desired settings.
 
 You find a description of each option in the next section, “Setting 
options for audio and video files.”
 
 
6. Click the Preview button (at the top of the work area) to open the page 
in a browser.
 
 Dreamweaver doesn’t include a Play button for audio and video files 
(unless they’re in the Flash format). If you have the necessary player on 
your computer and set the file to Autoplay (the default setting), your file 
plays automatically when the page loads into the browser. To change 
video and audio settings that aren’t included in the Property inspector, 
such as Autoplay, see the “Setting multimedia parameters” section later 
in this chapter.
Setting options for audio and video files
When you select an inserted multimedia file, such as a sound or a video file, 
the Property inspector displays the options for the file, as shown in Figure 
10-5. Among these settings, the height and width are the most important. 
Unlike image files or Flash files, Dreamweaver can’t automatically detect the 
height and width of other audio or video formats, so it’s important to set 
these options in the Property inspector. To determine the height and width 
of a video file, you may need to open the file in a video-editing program. For 
audio files, set the height and width based on the size required for the player 
you’re using.

302
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
The following describes the multimedia options available from the Property 
inspector:
 
✓ ID field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Property 
inspector, just to the right of the plug-in icon, if you want to assign a 
name to the file. If you leave this field blank, Dreamweaver doesn’t enter 
a name automatically unless you are using a file in a Flash format. The 
name is important only if you want to refer to the file in JavaScript.
 
✓ W (width) and H (height): Specify the measurement of the file in pixels.
 
✓ Src (source): This option specifies the name and path to the file. You 
can type a filename or click the Browse button (which looks like a small 
yellow folder) to browse for the file. This field is filled in automatically 
when you embed the file.
 
✓ Plg URL: This option enables you to provide a URL where viewers can 
download the plug-in if they don’t already have it.
 
✓ Align: This option enables you to specify how the element aligns on the 
page. Alignment works just as it does for images.

✓ Play button: Click the green Play button to preview the media file. The 
media plug-in must be installed in Dreamweaver (in the Configuration/
Plugins folder) for it to be previewed in Dreamweaver.
 
✓ Class: Use this drop-down list to apply any style sheets defined for the 
document.
 
✓ V Space (vertical space): If you want blank space above and below the 
plug-in, enter the number of pixels here.
 
✓ H Space (horizontal space): If you want blank space on either side of the 
plug-in, enter the number of pixels or use a percentage to specify a por-
tion of the browser window’s width.
 
✓ Border: This option specifies the width of the border around the file 
when it’s displayed.
 
✓ Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box where you can 
enter additional parameters specific to the type of multimedia file you 
inserted. For more information, see the following section.
Setting multimedia parameters
You can use parameters to control a wide range of multimedia options, such 
as whether a video file or an audio file starts playing as soon as a page is 
loaded. Setting parameters isn’t intuitive, and Dreamweaver doesn’t do the 
best job of helping with these settings. However, with some research on the 
options for the file type you’re using and a little care in using the Parameters 
dialog box in Dreamweaver, you can have a lot more control over your multi-
media files.
In fairness to the programmers who created Dreamweaver, it’d be hard to 
include all the parameters for all the possible multimedia file types in use on 
the Web today, but they could’ve included the common ones. Because they 
don’t, I offer you this brief primer on using the parameters setting and a few 
common options for a few common file types. You also find Web addresses 
where you can find more complete lists of parameters for a few of the most 
popular audio and video formats.
In Figure 10-6, you see the Parameters dialog box with settings for a Windows 
Media Video file. The following steps outline how the process works:
 
1. To access the Parameters dialog box, click to select the multimedia 
file in the Web page and then click the Parameters button in the 
Property inspector.
 
 The Parameters dialog box opens. The dialog box is blank unless you 
have already entered parameters for the selected file.
 
2. Use the plus sign (+) at the top of the dialog box to add a parameter; 
use the minus sign (–) to delete a selected parameter.

304
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
3. On the left side of the dialog box, enter the name of the parameter, 
such as autoplay; on the right side, enter the value you want, such 
as false, which I’ve entered in this example to prevent the Windows 
Media Video file from playing automatically.
 
You can move from the name side of the Parameters dialog box to the value 
side by pressing the Tab key or by clicking to insert your cursor.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Add param-
eters for 
additional 
audio and 
video 
settings.
 
To help you get started with parameters, here are some of the most common 
and valuable parameters:
 
✓ Autoplay (or Autostart, depending on the file type): By default, when 
you add video or audio to an HTML file, most browsers play the file as 
soon as the page loads (except Firefox, which gives users more control). 
If you want to prevent your multimedia files from playing automatically 
in Internet Explorer and other browsers, set the Autoplay or Autostart 
parameter to false. Think of true and false as on and off when it 
comes to parameters.
 
✓ Loop: This parameter enables you to control whether a video file or an 
audio file loops or continues to play over and over.
 
✓ showControls: This option makes it possible to hide the video or audio 
controls for a file.
 
 Be careful about combining options like these. For example, if you set 
Autoplay to false and showControls to false, your visitor can never 
play your file. By default, the controls for most multimedia files are vis-
ible unless you set the showControls parameter to false.

Adding Flash audio and video files
Flash video is the video format of choice among many designers because so 
many people have the Flash Player and the player’s such a small and easy 
download for those who don’t have it. Because Adobe owns both Flash and 
Dreamweaver, you find much better support for Flash files in Dreamweaver. 
An Insert dialog box makes it easy to set parameters for Flash. The Insert FLV 
dialog box is displayed in Figure 10-7. Dreamweaver can even automatically 
detect the size of Flash video files. You can also use Flash to create and insert 
audio files, displaying only the player (called a skin in Flash).
 
Figure 10-7: 
You can 
specify 
how a Flash 
video will be 
displayed in 
a Web page 
in the Insert 
FLV dialog 
box.
 
Follow these steps to insert a Flash video file into a Web page:
 
1. Click where you want the file to appear on your Web page.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪FLV.
 
 The Insert FLV dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose FLV from the Media drop-down list in the 
Common Insert panel select (refer to Figure 10-1 at the beginning of this

3. At the top of the dialog box, specify Streaming or Progressive.
 
 You must have special server software to handle streaming video. 
Check with your Internet hosting service or system administrator to 
find out whether your Web server supports streaming Flash files. If not, 
choose Progressive, which offers some of the advantages of streaming 
and works on any Web server. For more this topic, read the sidebar 
“Streaming media plays faster,” earlier in this chapter.

4. Click the Browse button to the right of the URL field and browse to 
find the Flash FLV file you want to add to the page. Select the file and 
click OK.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically adds the filename and path to your Flash 
file in the URL field. 
 
5. Choose a skin from the Skin drop-down list.
 
 Dreamweaver calls the controls for a Flash file a skin. As you can see 
in Figure 10-7, a preview of the selected skin appears in the dialog box 
so you can better decide which one is best for your Flash file and your 
design. You can also create custom skins in Adobe Flash.
 
6. Click the Detect Size button to insert the height and width of the 
inserted Flash file (if Dreamweaver hasn’t already done so).
 
7. If you want the Flash video to play as soon as the page is loaded, 
select the Auto Play check box.
 
8. If you want the video to rewind after play is complete, select the Auto 
Rewind check box.
 
9. Click OK to insert the Flash file and close the dialog box.
 
 The Flash file appears on the page, represented by a gray box that’s the 
height and width of the file. To view the Flash video, preview the page in 
a Web browser.
 
When you insert a Flash video file and include a skin for the player, 
Dreamweaver creates a Flash file for the player with the .swf extension and 
saves the file in your local site folder. This Flash file contains the player con-
trols and must be uploaded to your Web site when you publish the page with 
the Flash file for the player controls to work.
You can change the skin by clicking to select the inserted Flash file and using 
the Skin drop-down list in the Property inspector to select another option, as 
shown in Figure 10-8. Each time you choose a skin, Dreamweaver creates a 
new .swf file. You can delete any skins that aren’t being used.

Converting video files into Flash format 
with the Flash video encoder
If you want to convert video from nearly any video format into the Flash 
video format, you can use the Flash video encoder, which is included in all 
the Adobe Create Suite packages that include Flash. The following exercise 
walks you through the process of converting a video file into Flash video with 
the Flash video encoder. 
 
1. Launch the Flash video encoder, as shown in Figure 10-9.
 
Figure 10-9: 
The Flash 
video 
encoder is 
designed 
to convert 
video in 
nearly any 
format into 
the Flash 
video 
format.
 
 
2. Click the Add button to load a video into the encoder that you want to 
convert into a Flash video file.
 
 In this example, I added a short video clip that was saved in the 
Windows Media Video (WMV) format, but you can add video in a variety 
of formats, including AVI and QuickTime. For best results, start with a 
video that hasn’t already been compressed.

308

3. Click the Settings button.
 
 The Flash Video Encoding Settings dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 10-10.
 
Figure 10-10: 
The Flash 
Video 
Encoder 
Settings 
dialog box 
includes 
five different 
tabs with 
video set-
ting options.
 
 
4. Click the Encoding Profiles tab and choose a Flash encoding profile.
 
 The later the version of Flash, the better the encoding looks and the 
faster it plays, but here’s the trade off: Not everyone has downloaded 
the latest version, so an earlier version may mean fewer visitors have 
to download the player to view your video. Because Flash is such a fast 
and easy program to download, the latest version is generally the best 
choice though.
 
5. Click the Video tab and specify additional video settings.
 
a. Make sure Encode Video is checked. The video codec (which con-
trols the compression of the video) is set automatically based on 
the Flash version you selected on the Encoding Profiles tab. Select 
Deinterlace only if you’re encoding video that’s interlaced, such as 
video captured from a television or VCR. Video that’s already been 
encoded in a format like Windows Media doesn’t need to be dein-
terlaced.
 
b. Set Framerate to the lowest setting that will look good to achieve 
the fastest download time. If you’re encoding a video that has lots 
of action, you need a higher frame rate, ideally 24 or better, or your 
video will lose details and look fuzzy in places. If you’re converting 

309
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
a video, such as a Windows Media file that’s already been encoded, 
your best option is to choose Same as Source to leave the frame-
rate unchanged.
 
c. Set the Quality to the lowest level that still looks good to get the 
fastest download times. Use the slider under the preview window 
to move through the frames of the video to see the effects of your 
settings.
 
6. Click the Audio tab to adjust audio settings.
 
 Under the Audio tab, adjust the Data rate. Again, the lower the number, 
the lower the quality but the faster the download. If your audio has only 
a single voice, you can set this quite low, and it’ll still sound good. If 
your audio file has music, special sound effects, or other multifaceted 
audio, set the Data rate to at least 96 Kbps (kilobits per second).
 
7. Use the Cue Points tab and insert cues in the file that make it easier 
for someone using the file to jump to a particular section.
 
8. Use the Crop and Resize tab to make the file physically smaller or 
larger.
 
 Note that trying to increase the file size of a video can result in a severe 
loss of quality.
 
9. After the settings are complete, click OK.
 
 The Flash Video Encoder Settings dialog box closes, returning you to the 
Flash video encoder.
 
10. Click Start Queue to begin the encoding process.
 
 This process can take several minutes, even for a very short file. A small 
preview window in the bottom-right corner of the Flash video encoder 
enables you to watch the encoding process in action.
 
 When the encoding process is complete, the Flash video encoder has 
created a copy of the video file in the FLV Flash video format.
Using YouTube and Other 
Services to Host Videos
Instead of hosting your video on your own Web server, an increasingly popu-
lar alternative is to upload video files to YouTube, Vimeo, or another video 
hosting site and then include special code from that site in the HTML code 
of your Web pages. The video plays within your pages, even though it’s not 
hosted on your Web server. 

310
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Adding video from a site like YouTube to your pages is easier and often 
works better than inserting video directly into your site. The many video 
hosting sites today range from expensive high-end services, such as 
BrightCove and Akamai, which handle big video clients like The New York 
Times and Showtime to free services, like YouTube.
 
YouTube is a great option if you want your video to reach the widest audience 
(for free) but when you upload a video to YouTube, you give up some of your 
rights to your video in exchange for having it hosted on the site. Similarly, 
when you add a video to your site from YouTube, you’re stuck with the 
YouTube player, which includes the YouTube logo, as well as links to other 
videos on YouTube. Make sure to read through the terms and conditions on 
any video site you use so that you fully understand the rights (to your own 
video) you may be giving away and how the site may use your video in the 
future. 
Vimeo is becoming increasingly popular because it offers a reasonably priced 
professional level of service that makes it easier to control the rights to your 
own videos and offers the option of adding videos to your pages without the 
Vimeo logo or links to other videos on the site
Today YouTube and Vimeo seem to offer the best options for most small- to 
medium-sized Web sites, but new competitors are emerging. The services 
that these video companies offer keep changing, so you may want to research 
the best services for your videos needs before you decide where to host your 
videos.
The advantages of hosting video on a site like YouTube or Vimeo include the 
following:
 
✓ Better Video Compression: Both YouTube and Vimeo optimize video for 
you when you upload it to their servers, and they often to a better job 
than you could yourself. 
 
✓ Deliver the right version to each visitor: YouTube detects the connec-
tion speed and device of your visitors and delivers video accordingly. 
If you visit YouTube with an iPhone, you see the video in MP4 format. 
View the same video with a computer, and you see the Flash version. 
Similarly, if you have a fast 3G connection, you see a higher-resolution 
version. View the video with a slower connection, and you see a lower-
quality version that loads faster.
 
✓ Manage bandwidth costs: These services can also help you save money. 
If your videos become popular and you host your own video, you may 
exceed the bandwidth limits of your Web host and incur additional fees. 
Because video uses more bandwidth than other types of content, over-
ages can get costly. Hosting your video on YouTube or Vimeo means 
you’ll never be surprised by extra bandwidth fees for video.

311
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
Hosting video on YouTube or Vimeo is easy. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Create an account on the site by filling out a form (or log into your 
account if you already have one). 
 
 If you want to use the professional-level services on Vimeo, you also 
must pay a fee. 
 
2. Upload your files to the site through your Web browser. 
 
 In this process, the video is uploaded and encoded, which can take a few 
minutes depending on the site and how busy it is.
 
3. Follow the site’s instructions for copying the code you need to embed 
your video on your Web site. 
 
4. Open your Web page in Dreamweaver, and paste the code snippet 
into the HTML code on your page, in the place you want the video to 
appear. 
 
 Use Dreamweaver’s split view to make it easy to find the right place to 
paste in the code.
Working with Java
Java is a programming language, similar to Basic, C, or C++, that you can use 
to create programs that run on a computer. What makes Java special is that 
it can run on any computer system and can display within a browser. 
If you create a program in another programming language, you usually have 
to create one version for the Macintosh, another for the PC, and a third for 
Unix. But Java, created by Sun Microsystems, is platform-independent. Thus, 
developers can use it to create almost any kind of program — even complex 
programs, such as a sophisticated game or even a word processing program — 
that works on any type of computer without the user having to customize the 
code for each platform.
Another advantage of Java is that the program (dubbed an applet) can run 
within a Web browser, allowing the program to interact with different ele-
ments of the page or with other pages on the Web. Applets enable designers 
to add sophisticated capabilities to Web pages — irrespective of the visitor’s 
operating system — making Java popular on the Internet. You can embed 
Java applets in Web pages, you can use Java to generate entire Web pages, 
or you can run Java applications separately after they download. Similar to 
Flash, Java requires a plug-in on the user’s computer.

Inserting Java applets
To insert a Java applet in your Web page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click where you want the applet to appear on your Web page.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪Applet
 
 The Select File dialog box appears.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Applet from the Media drop-down list in 
the Common Insert panel (refer to Figure 10-1).
 
3. Use the Browse button to locate the Java applet file you want to insert 
on the page.
 
4. Click to highlight the filename and then click OK to close the 
dialog box.
 
 Dreamweaver doesn’t display applets in the Dreamweaver work area. 
Instead, you see an icon that represents the applet. To view the applet 
on your Web page (the only way to see the applet in action), preview the 
page in a browser that supports applets, such as Firefox.
 
5. Click the Applet icon to open the Property inspector.
 
 You can set many options in the Property inspector. If you want to know 
more about these options, read on.
JavaScript is not Java
JavaScript is a scripting language; Java is a 
programming language. Despite the similarity 
in their names, the two have little in common. 
Although JavaScript is much more com-
plex than HTML, it’s much simpler than Java 
and has far fewer capabilities. Unlike Java, 
JavaScript can be written directly into HTML 
code to create interactive features, such as 
rollover effects. Dreamweaver uses JavaScript 
to create most of the features included in the 
Behaviors panel (covered in Chapter 9).
You can use Java to create more complex pro-
gramming than you can create with JavaScript. 
Java programs, or applets, are usually small, 
self-contained programs that can run on any 
operating system. If you search the Web for 
Java applets, you’re likely to find cool little 
clocks, converters, and other programs that you 
can download and add to your Web pages. You 
can use Java to create programs that work on 
both the Mac and PC, an advantage over other 
programming languages that makes Java espe-
cially well-suited to the multiplatform world of 
Web design.

313
 Chapter 10: Showing Off with Multimedia
Setting Java parameters and other options
Like other file formats that require plug-ins or advanced browser support, 
the display of Java applets can be controlled by specifying a number of 
options. If you select a Java applet in Dreamweaver, the Property inspector 
displays the following options:
 
✓ Applet name: Use this field in the upper-left corner if you want to type 
a name for your applet. Dreamweaver doesn’t apply a name if you leave 
this field blank. This name identifies the applet for scripting.
 
✓ W (width): This option specifies the width of the applet. You can set 
the measurement in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s 
width.
 
✓ H (height): This option specifies the height of the applet. You can set 
the measurement in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s 
height.
 
✓ Code: Dreamweaver automatically enters the code when you insert the 
file. Code specifies the content file of the applet. You can type your own 
filename or click the folder icon to choose a file.
 
✓ Base: Automatically entered when you insert the file, Base identifies the 
folder that contains the applet.
 
✓ Align: This option determines how the object aligns on the page. 
Alignment works just as it does for images.
 
✓ Alt: This option enables you to specify an alternative file, such as an 
image, that appears if the viewer’s browser doesn’t support Java. That 
way, the user doesn’t see a broken file icon. If you type text in this field, 
the viewer sees this text; Dreamweaver writes it into the code by using 
the Alt attribute of the <applet> tag. If you use the folder icon to 
select an image, the viewer sees an image; Dreamweaver automatically 
inserts an <img> tag within the <applet> and </applet> tags of the 
applet.
 
✓ V Space (vertical space): If you want blank space above or below the 
applet, enter the number of pixels here.
 
✓ H Space (horizontal space): If you want blank space on either side of the 
applet, enter the number of pixels here.
 
✓ Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box in which you can 
enter additional parameters for the applet.
 
✓ Class: Use this drop-down list to access style sheets created with CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets).

Linking to PDFs
Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) has become increasingly popular 
on the Internet, and with good reason. Now that Acrobat Reader is widely dis-
tributed and even built into more recent browser versions, you can assume 
that most of your audience can read files in PDF.
PDF is a great option for files that you want to make easy to download in their 
entirety to be saved on a hard drive, as well as documents that you want 
printed exactly as they’re designed. Because the PDF viewer is free, your 
users don’t need expensive software, such as Microsoft Word or Lotus Notes, 
to view your documents.
In the early days, PDFs were limited to text and images, but the most recent 
versions support audio, video, and even Flash files meaning you can now 
create complex multimedia presentations in PDF format.
To add a PDF file to your Web site, simply copy the file into your local site 
folder and link to it as you’d link to any other Web page on your site. When 
you upload the page with the link to your PDF file, make sure to upload the 
PDF as well.

Forms Follow Function
In This Chapter
▶ Creating forms in HTML
▶ Creating radio buttons, check boxes, and text fields
▶ Adding drop-down lists, Submit/Reset buttons, and jump menus
▶ Connecting forms to CGI scripts
▶ Working with hidden fields
F
orms follow function, to paraphrase the old saying. On the Web, many of 
the most advanced and interactive features you can add to a Web page 
require forms — structures for collecting information from users — informa-
tion that can then be used in a variety of ways. Forms are commonly used to 
create guest books, contact forms, search-engine entry fields, chat rooms, 
and discussion areas.
When you design a form, Dreamweaver makes it relatively easy to create 
such controls as check boxes, radio buttons, and text boxes — (which show 
up on-screen as fields that the user fills in. Other common form elements 
include drop-down lists (which make it possible to add a long list of options 
to a page without taking up too much space) and Submit buttons (which a 
user must click when they finish filling out a form). You’ll also find options 
in Dreamweaver for specifying text box sizes, character limits, and other 
features. After you build your form, you may want to consider formatting 
options, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), to make it look good.
But if you want your form to actually do something, you have to pair it with 
a program on your Web server. One of the most confusing aspects of work-
ing with HTML forms is that they don’t do much until you’ve connected 
them to a script (essentially a short program that executes a limited set of 
commands). Most forms are processed by Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
scripts or some other program. These scripts can be written in different pro-
gramming languages — including PHP, ASP.NET, C, C#, Java, and Perl. CGI 
scripts are far more complex than simple HTML files. Even experienced Web 

316
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
designers often purchase scripts created by a third party or hire experienced 
programmers to develop CGI scripts for them — especially for complex fea-
tures, such as discussion boards or shopping carts.
Fortunately for those who don’t have a computer science degree or a huge 
budget for programmers, many free and low-priced scripts are available on 
the Web. Search the Internet for CGI scripts and you’ll find an impressive col-
lection of ready-to-use programs, many of them free. Be aware, however, that 
when you download a program, you could be creating a security risk for your 
server (so look for trustworthy scripts with good reviews and support).
You also have to know how to configure and install any script you download 
on your Web server, which may require special access. How you install a 
script on your server depends on how your server is set up. Unfortunately, 
this book can’t show you everything there is to know about working with all 
the different kinds of scripts available on the Web on all the different kinds 
of servers. (That would require a shelf full of books.) But I do try to give you 
an idea of what’s involved in working with CGI scripts — and what to do in 
Dreamweaver to make sure your HTML form will work with a script.
The first part of this chapter includes instructions for creating the common 
elements in an HTML form, from radio buttons to text boxes. In the last part 
of the chapter, I include instructions for configuring a form to work with a 
common CGI script that you can use to send the contents of a form to any 
specified e-mail address. The steps and features covered in the final exercise 
also help you with other kinds of CGI scripts, but you should note that how 
you work with forms will depend on your Web hosting service and the spe-
cific configuration and requirements of your server.
 
You also need to create forms when you build dynamic Web sites using 
Dreamweaver’s ColdFusion, ASP.NET, or PHP features. If you’re creating a 
dynamic or database-driven site, use the features specific to those technolo-
gies, which are covered in Chapter 13. In this chapter, you find out how to 
create HTML forms in Dreamweaver.
Creating HTML Forms
No matter what kinds of fields you put in your form — radio buttons, check 
boxes, and text areas, for example — you start by inserting the <form> tag 
itself. Think of a <form> tag as the logical container for the instructions that 
create all the buttons, boxes, and so on that you place in your form.
 
Make sure you start with this first step — creating an HTML form — before 
you move on to the other exercises in this chapter.

317
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
The following exercise walks you through creating an HTML form. Start with 
an open page — either a new page or an existing page to which you want to 
add a form:
 
 
1. Choose Insert➪Form➪Form or click the Form icon on the Forms 
Insert bar.
 
 
 An empty <form> tag is inserted in your document and is displayed 
as a rectangle outlined by a red dotted line like the one shown in the 
Document area in Figure 11-1. This dotted line defines the boundaries of 
a form in the HTML code.
 
 You can control the display of invisible elements, such as <form> tags. 
Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences 
(Mac). Then, in the Invisible Elements category, select or deselect the 
Form Delimiter box. When the box is selected the form outline is visible 
in the Dreamweaver workspace, as you see in Figure 11-1.
 
2. Click the red outline to select the <form> tag and display the <form> 
tag options in the Property inspector (as shown in the bottom of 
Figure 11-1).
 
Figure 11-1: 
The Forms 
Insert bar 
provides 
easy access 
to all 
common

elements.
 

318

3. In the Form ID text box, type a name.
 
 In this example, I entered the name form1. You can choose any name for 
this field as long as you don’t use spaces, special characters, or punctua-
tion. With your basic HTML form set up, you’re ready to add elements to 
it, as explained in the following sections.
 
Before you begin filling your form with options, keep the following tips in mind:
 
✓ The best way to get your form fields to line up nicely is to use CSS. By 
creating styles that control the spacing and padding of form elements, 
you can make all your fields, buttons, and other elements line up neatly. 
(Chapters 5 and 6 cover CSS.)
 
✓ After you design your form, your work isn’t quite done; your form 
won’t do anything unless you configure it to work with a script. 
Although Dreamweaver doesn’t provide any scripts, it does make linking 
your HTML forms to a script — or to a database — relatively easy. The 
section “Understanding How CGI Scripts Work” (later in this chapter) 
offers more details on making your form work with a script.
 
 Match the script. Most fields displayed in the Property inspector when the 
<form> tag options are on-screen should be set to match those in the CGI 
script or other program that’s used to collect and process the data from 
the form. You find instructions for filling in these fields in the “Configuring 
your form to work with a script” section, at the end of this chapter.
 
 Use Accessibility Settings. The accompanying sidebar, “Making forms 
accessible,” offers some practical examples of how the Accessibility set-
tings in Dreamweaver can help you tweak your forms’ characteristics to 
make them easier to use for all of the visitors to your site.
Making forms accessible
You can make your forms much easier to use 
and more accessible to all your visitors by using 
the <label> tag and other accessibility attri-
butes with form items. Dreamweaver makes 
this easy by including an Input Tag Accessibility 
Attributes dialog box, as shown in the figure. 
For this dialog box to appear when you insert a 
form item such as a radio button or a check box, 
you must have accessibility features turned on 
in Dreamweaver’s Preference settings. To turn 
on these features, choose Edit➪Preferences 
(Dreamweaver➪Preferences on a Mac); in the 
Preferences dialog box, click the Accessibility 
category, and select the Form Objects option.
With the accessibility options turned on, the 
Input Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box 
opens automatically when you insert a form 
item (such as a radio button or a text box). Use 
this dialog box to specify the following options:
 ✓ ID: Use the ID field to assign a name to 
a form element. The name is important 
because it can be used to refer to the field 
in a script. The ID is also used if you choose 
Attach Label Tag Using ‘For’ Attribute option 
under the Style options. If you’re not using 
the form with a script or a Label, you can 

319
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
leave this field blank, and Dreamweaver 
won’t enter a name automatically.
 ✓ Label: Enter a name that describes the form 
element (radio button, check box, text field, 
whatever) — for example Email Address 
for a text field where you want the user 
to enter their e-mail address. The text you 
enter in the label field will appear next to a 
form field in the Web page, but if you enter 
it as a label and not just as text; it will have 
more meaning when it’s read by a screen 
reader (a program that provides audible 
descriptions of screen elements to visually 
impaired users).
 ✓ Style: Check one of these three options to 
specify how the label should be included 
with the form field in the HTML code. 
The option Attach Label Tag Using ‘For’ 
Attribute is recommended as the best 
option for accessibility because it wraps 
the label tag around the entire form field, 
ensuring that the label and the form field 
will always be associated with each other. 
This option makes it easier to select a form 
field, such as a check box or radio button, 
because they can select the field by click-
ing anywhere in the text associated with it, 
instead of having to click precisely inside 
the check box or radio button.
 ✓ Position: Check the corresponding box 
to specify whether the label text should 
appear before or after each form item.
 ✓ Access Key: This attribute enables you to 
create a keyboard shortcut for each of your 
form items. You can enter any letter in this 
field, and your users can select the form 
item by holding down the Alt key (Windows) 
or the Control key (Macintosh) and typing 
the letter you specify. For example, if you 
enter Q as the Access Key, a visitor to your 
site who uses a Windows computer could 
press Alt+Q to select the form item.
 ✓ Tab Index: By default, a visitor to your site 
can use the Tab key to move from one 
form field to another in the order the form 
items appear on the page. With the Tab 
Index, you can specify the order in which 
the Tab key progresses from one form item 
to another. This is especially helpful if you 
have links and other form items on a page, 
and you want the user to be able to tab 
through them in a specific order. To control 
the order, assign a number to each form. Be 
sure to number your form items in ascend-
ing numerical order (as with 1, 2, 3) — and 
don’t skip any numbers or the tab order will 
revert to the visual layout order.

320
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Creating radio buttons and check boxes
Radio buttons and check boxes make filling in a form easy for viewers of your 
site. Instead of making users type a word (such as yes or no), you can pro-
vide radio buttons and check boxes so users can simply click boxes or but-
tons to make a specific and consistent choice. Using buttons, check boxes, 
and multiple-choice lists, covered later in this chapter, can also help ensure 
that the data collected in a form is consistent.
What’s the difference between radio buttons and check boxes? Radio but-
tons (like the pushbuttons on old car radios) enable users to select only one 
option from a group. Thus radio buttons are good for either/or options — or 
situations in which you want users to make only one selection. Check boxes, 
on the other hand, enable users to make multiple choices, so they’re good for 
choose-all-that-apply situations or for situations that require approval, such 
as “Check this box if. . .”
Creating radio buttons
To create radio buttons on a form, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the boundary of the <form> tag 
where you want to add a radio button.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted the <form> tag, follow the steps in the sec-
tion “Creating HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the Radio Button icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Radio Button. Either way, a radio 
button appears inside the form’s red boundary line.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input 
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See the sidebar “Making 
forms accessible” to find out more about these options.)
 
3. Repeat Step 2 until you have the number of radio buttons you want.
 
4. Select one of the radio buttons on the form to reveal the radio but-
ton’s properties in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
Figure 11-2: 
Properties 
of radio 
buttons. 

321
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
5. In the Radio Button text box on the far left of the Property inspector, 
type a name.
 
 All radio buttons in a group should have the same name so that the 
browser associates them with one another and prevents users from 
selecting more than one. If you want users to be able to choose more 
than one item from a list, use check boxes instead, as described in the 
following section.
 
6. In the Checked Value text box, type a name.
 
 Each radio button in a group should have a different Checked Value 
name so it can be distinguished from the others. Naming radio buttons 
for the thing they represent is often a good practice; for example, yes 
when the choice is yes and no when it’s no. If you’re asking users about 
their favorite ice cream flavors, you might use as values the flavor each 
button represents. 
 
 The Checked Value name is usually included in the data you get back 
when the form is processed and returned to you (the data collected by a 
form can be returned in an e-mail message or sent directly to a database 
or other data-storage option). How the data is returned depends on the 
CGI script or other programming used to process the form. If you’re 
looking at the data later, interpreting it is easier if the name is something 
that makes sense to you.
 
7. For the Initial State option, select Checked or Unchecked.
 
 These two options determine whether the radio button on your form 
appears already selected when the Web page loads. Select Checked if 
you want to preselect a choice. You should set only one radio button 
option to be preselected; remember that the user can always override 
this setting by selecting another radio button.
 
8. Select the other radio buttons one by one in the main design area and 
repeat Steps 5–7 to specify the properties in the Property inspector for 
each one.
 
If you want to create a series of radio buttons, you’ll find some advantages 
to using the Radio Group button in the Insert Form panel. Dreamweaver cre-
ates IDs for each radio button automatically. If you want to change these IDs, 
you may find it easier to change them in code view. You can split the screen 
between code and design views by clicking the Split view button at the top of 
the workspace.
If you want to format your form with CSS styles, you can create tag styles 
for the form, radio button, and other tags, or you can create class styles and 
apply them to any or all of your tags using the Class drop-down list in the 

322
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Property inspector. (You find more information about creating and applying 
styles in Chapters 5 and 6.)
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Creating check boxes
To create check boxes, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the boundary of the <form> tag 
where you want to add a checkbox.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted a <form> tag, follow the steps in the 
“Creating HTML Forms” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the Checkbox icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Check Box.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input 
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See the sidebar “Making 
forms accessible,” to find out more about these options.)
 
3. Repeat Step 2 to place as many check boxes as you want.
 
4. Select one of the check boxes on your form to reveal the check-box 
properties in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
Figure 11-3: 
Properties 
of check 
boxes. 
 
5. In the Checkbox Name text box, type a name.
 
 Use a distinct name for each check box. Users can select more than one 
check box, and you want to ensure that the information submitted is 
properly associated with each individual check box.
 
6. In the Checked Value text box, type a name.
 
 Every check box in a group should have a different Checked Value name 
so the CGI script can tell the boxes apart. Naming them for the things 
they represent is a good practice. As with radio buttons, the checked 
value is usually included in the data you get back when the form is pro-
cessed and returned to you. If you’re looking at the data later, it’s easier 
to interpret if the name is something that makes sense to you.

323
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
 If you’re looking at the data later — say, reading an e-mail message that 
lists the text in the Checked Value box name and whatever the user 
entered into the field — is the data is easier to understand if the name 
is something that makes sense to you. For example, entering the word 
Chocolate instead of Option2 will result in data that looks like this: 
Chocolate=yes instead of Option2=yes.
 
7. For the Initial State option, select Checked or Unchecked.
 
 This option determines whether the check box appears already selected 
when the Web page loads. Select Checked if you want to preselect a 
choice. A user can always override this preselection by clicking the text 
box again to deselect it.
 
8. Select the other check boxes one by one and repeat Steps 5–7 to set 
the properties in the Property inspector for each one.
 
If you want to create a series of check boxes, you’ll find some advantages to 
using the Checkbox Group button in the Insert Form panel.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Adding text fields and text areas
When you want users to enter text, such as a name, an e-mail address, or a 
comment, use a text field. To insert text fields, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a text field.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted a <form> tag, follow the steps in the 
“Creating HTML Forms” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the Text Field icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Text Field. A text field box appears.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input Tag 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (Refer to the “Making forms 
accessible” sidebar to find out more about these options.)
 
3. On the form, click to place your cursor next to the first text field and 
type a question or other text prompt.
 
 For example, you may want to type E-mail Address: next to a text box 
where you want a user to enter an e-mail address.
 
4. Select the text field on your form to reveal the Text Field properties in 
the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 11-4.

324
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
Figure 11-4: 
The 
TextField 
option 
enables 
users to 
enter text.
 
 
5. In the TextField text box, type a name.
 
 Each text area on a form should have a different text field name so the 
CGI script can distinguish it from the others. Naming text areas for the 
things they represent is usually best, but don’t use any spaces or special 
characters (other than the hyphen or underscore). In Figure 11-4, you 
can see that I named the text field email. Many scripts return this name 
next to the contents of the text field a visitor enters at your Web site. If 
you’re looking at the data later, you can interpret it more easily if the 
name corresponds to the choice.
 
6. In the Char Width box, type the number of characters you want vis-
ible in the field.
 
 This setting determines the width of the text field that appears on 
the page. In the example shown here, I’ve set the character width to 
50 to create a text box that’s more than wide enough for most e-mail 
addresses. How wide you make your text boxes depends on the amount 
of information you expect users to enter — and on the constraints of 
your design.
 
7. In the Max Chars box, type the maximum number of characters you 
want to allow.
 
 If you leave this field blank, users can type as many characters as they 
choose, even if their entries exceed the physical length of the text box 
specified in the Char Width field.
 
 I usually limit the number of characters only if I want to maintain con-
sistency in the data (for example, I like to limit the State field to a two-
character abbreviation). Creating drop-down lists, which require users 
to make a selection rather than risking that they might make a typo, is 
an even better way to ensure consistent data. You find instructions for 
creating drop-downs in the exercise that follows.
 
 You can set the Char Width field to be longer or shorter than the Max 
Chars field. If users type more characters than can appear in the text 
field, the text scrolls so that users can still see all the text they enter, 
even if it can’t be displayed in the text field all at once.

325
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
8. Next to Type, select one of the following options:
 
• Single Line creates a one-line text box, such as the kind I created 
for the hat size field shown in Figure 11-4.
 
• Multi Line gives users space to enter text. (Note that if you select 
Multi Line, you also need to specify the number of lines you want 
the text area to cover by typing a number in the Num Lines field, 
which appears as an option when you choose Multi Line.)
 
• Password is used if you’re asking users to enter data that they 
might not want to display on-screen. This type of field causes 
entered data to appear as asterisks — and disables copying from 
the field (essential if you’re going to keep the password secure).
 
9. Use the Class drop-down list to apply any class CSS styles that may be 
defined in the site.
 
 You can create class styles for many purposes, including formatting 
form elements. (For more about creating and applying class styles, see 
Chapters 5 and 6.)
 
10. In the Init Val text box, type any text you want displayed when the 
form loads.
 
 For example, you can include Add e-mail address here on the form 
in the text field under Comments. Users can delete the Init Val text or 
leave it and add more text in the same text field.
 
11. If you’re creating a multiline text area, specify the Wrap options.
 
 The Wrap field controls how the users’ data is displayed if it exceeds the 
length of the text field. Selecting Off or Default prevents the users’ text 
from wrapping to the next line. (Note that this option is available only 
for multiline text boxes.)
 
12. Select the other text areas one by one and repeat Steps 5–9 to set the 
properties in the Property inspector for each one.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Creating drop-down lists
When you want to give users a multiple-choice option but don’t want to 
take up lots of space on the page, drop-down lists, such as the one shown 
in Figure 11-5, are an ideal solution. Drop-down lists are also a good option 
if you want to make sure that data collected in the form is consistent. For 
example, if you give users a list of state names instead of a text field, you 

326
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
don’t have to worry about the fact that some people may enter the full state 
name, others may enter two letters, and still others may misspell the name. 
If the data collected in your form is simply e-mailed to you, consistency may 
be no big deal. But if the data goes into a database where it needs to match 
other related data, misspellings and other variations can cause big problems.
 
Figure 11-5: 
The List/
Menu option 
enables you 
to create a 
drop-down 
list.
 
To create a drop-down list with Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a drop-down list.
 
 If you haven’t yet created a <form> tag, follow the steps in the “Creating 
HTML Forms” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the List/Menu icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪List/Menu. A drop-down list appears.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input 
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (Refer to the “Making 
forms accessible” sidebar, earlier in the chapter, for more about these 
options.)
 
3. Click to place your cursor next to the List field and enter a question or 
other text prompt.
 
 I typed What state do you live in?

327
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
4. Select the field that represents the list on your page to reveal the List/
Menu properties in the Property inspector.
 
5. In the List/Menu text box, type a name.
 
 Each list or menu on a form should have a different name so you can dif-
ferentiate the lists when the form data is returned.
 
6. Next to Type, select the Menu or List option.
 
 This step determines whether the form element is a drop-down list or a 
scrollable list. If you select List, you can specify the height and control 
of how many items are shown at a time. You can also specify whether 
a user can select more than one item. If you select Menu, these options 
aren’t available.
 
7. Click the List Values button, at the upper-right of the Property 
inspector.
 
 The List Values dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-6.
 
Figure 11-6: 
Create the 
options in 
the List form 
field.
 
 
8. Enter the choices you want to make available.
 
 Click the plus sign (+) to add an item label and then type the label text 
you want in the text box that appears in the dialog box. Item labels 
appear on the menu or list on the Web page in the order in which you 
enter them. Use the minus sign (–) to delete a selected option.
 
 Press the Tab key to move the cursor to the Value side of the dialog box, 
where you can enter a value. Values are optional, but if they’re present, 
they’re sent to the server instead of the label text. This feature provides 
a way of including information that you don’t want to display directly 
on the drop-down list. For example, if you enter Alabama as a label on 
the left, you can enter the abbreviation AL as a value on the right. If you 
enter Alaska as a label, you can enter AK as a value, and so on. That 
way, you visitors can select from a list that displays the full name of 
each state, but your script can collect only the two-letter abbreviations. 
If you don’t enter a value, the label is used as the submitted data when 
the form is processed.

328
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
 The first label entered in the List Values dialog box is the only one that’s 
displayed on the page until a user clicks the drop-down arrow. Thus, it’s 
good practice to include an instruction in this space, such as Choose a 
State, as shown in the example in Figures 11-5 and 11-6.
 
9. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Using jump menus
Many designers use jump menus (which take the user immediately to a dif-
ferent online location) as navigational elements because they can provide a 
list of links in a drop-down list without taking up lots of room on a Web page. 
You can also use a jump menu to launch an application or start an animation 
sequence. Jump menus are generally used as standalone features on a Web 
page, but they can be integrated into a form with other form items.
To create a jump menu, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a jump menu.
 
 Alternatively, you can create a jump menu anywhere on a page. If there 
is no form tag in place, Dreamweaver adds one automatically around the 
jump menu’s tag.
 
 
2. Click the Jump Menu icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Jump Menu. The Insert Jump Menu 
dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Text field, under Menu Items, type the name you want to dis-
play in the drop-down list.
 
 Click the plus sign (+) to add more items. As you type items in the Text 
field, they appear in the Menu Items list, as shown in Figure 11-7.
 
Figure 11-7: 
When you 
create a 
jump menu, 
items you 
type in the 
Text field 
appear in 
the Menu 
Items list.
 

329
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
4. Click the Browse button to locate the page you want to link to or type 
the URL for the page in the When Selected, Go to URL field.
 
 You can link to a local file or enter any URL to link to a page on another 
Web site, and you can use the Browse button to specify the URL you 
want to link to.
 
5. If you’re using frames, use the Open URLs In field to specify a target.
 
 If you’re not using frames, the default is Main Window. When the user 
selects an option, the new page replaces the page he or she is viewing. 
(I explain how to target links in frames in Chapter 8.)
 
6. If you want to enter a unique identifier for this menu, use the Menu ID 
field.
 
 This option can be useful if you have multiple jump menus on a page. 
You can use any name you want, but you can’t use spaces, special char-
acters, or punctuation.
 
7. If you want to force users to click a button to activate the selection, 
select the Insert Go Button after Menu option.
 
 If you don’t add a Go button, the linked page loads as soon as the user 
makes a selection. The Go button works like a Submit button for the 
jump-menu options.
Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons
For your users to be able to send their completed forms to you, create a 
Submit button, which, when clicked, tells the user’s browser to send the form 
to the CGI script or other program that processes the form. You may also 
want to add a Reset button, which enables users to erase any information 
they’ve entered if they want to start over.
 
Many developers don’t use the Reset button because they find it can be 
confusing to visitors (and annoying if it means they accidentally erase all 
the information they just entered). Because visitors can always leave a page 
before clicking the Submit button if they choose not to complete a form, the 
simplest way to avoid this problem is to avoid using a Reset button.
To create a Submit, Reset, or other button in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a button.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted the <form> tag (which appears as a red 
dotted line around your form), follow the steps in the earlier section 
“Creating HTML Forms” before continuing with these steps. You might 

330
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
also want to enter at least one text field or other field option. There’s 
not much point in having a Submit button if you don’t provide any fields 
where a user can enter data to be submitted.
 
 
2. Click the Button icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Button. 
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Button 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (The “Making forms acces-
sible” sidebar, earlier in the chapter, details these options.)
 
 A Submit button appears. 
 
3. Click to select the button.
 
 The Property inspector changes to reveal the form button properties, 
as shown in Figure 11-8. You can change the button to a Reset button or 
other kind of button by altering the attributes in the Property inspector, 
as shown in the remaining steps.
 
Figure 11-8: 
The form 
button prop-
erties. 
 
4. Next to Action, click the Submit Form or Reset Form option.
 
 The Submit Form option invokes an action, such as sending user infor-
mation to an e-mail address. The Reset Form option returns the page 
to the way it was when the page loaded. You can also select the None 
option, which creates a button that can be used for many purposes by 
combining it with a script.
 
5. In the Value text box, type the text you want to display on the button.
 
 You can type any text you want for the label, such as Search, Go, Clear, 
or Delete.
 
Having the user click a Submit button in a form doesn’t do much unless you’ve 
configured the form to work with a CGI script or other program that collects 
or processes user-entered data.
Understanding How CGI Scripts Work
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are (as mentioned earlier), programs 
written in a programming language (such as Perl, Java, C++, ASP, or PHP) that 
work in tandem with your Web server to process data submitted by a user. 

331
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
Think of CGI scripts as the engine behind an HTML form and many other 
automated features on a Web site. These scripts are much more complex to 
create than HTML pages — and these languages take much longer to figure 
out than HTML. CGI scripts reside and run on the server and are usually trig-
gered by an action a user takes, such as clicking the Submit button on an 
HTML form.
A common scenario with a script may go like this:
 
1. A user loads a page, such as a guest book, fills out the HTML form, and 
clicks the Submit button.
 
2. The browser gathers all the data from the form and sends it to the Web 
server in a standard format.
 
3. The Web server takes the incoming data and hands it off to the CGI 
script that unpacks the data and does something with it — such as plac-
ing it in an e-mail message and sending the message to a specified e-mail 
address, or adding the data to a Web page where guest-book comments 
are posted.
 
4. The CGI script then sends instructions or a block of HTML back to the 
browser through the Web server to report on the outcome of the script 
and to complete any final actions, such as displaying a Thank You page.
Configuring your form to 
work with a script
After you create a form using the features covered in the previous sections 
of this chapter, configure the form to work with a CGI script or a program. To 
help you understand how this process works, I use the common formmail.
pl script in the following exercise. This clever little script is designed to col-
lect data entered into an HTML form and send it to a specified e-mail address. 
You can find out more about formmail.pl at www.scriptarchive.com (a 
great place to find lots of free CGI scripts).
 
Every script is different. The details of how you install and configure a script 
depend on the individual program — and on how your server is set up.
If your service provider doesn’t offer a mail script to use in your form, you 
can download and configure the script if you have the right access on your 
server (and knowledge of how your server is configured). Ask your service 
provider for more information. If your service provider doesn’t provide the 
interactive scripts you want, you may want to consider moving your site to a 
hosting service that does provide CGI scripts you can use.

332
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
The following exercise shows you how to use Dreamweaver with the 
formmail.pl script. This gives you a good introduction to how you’d set 
up any form to work with any script — but be aware that you may have to 
alter some of the steps to work with the program you’re using:
 
1. Select the <form> tag that surrounds your form by clicking anywhere 
on the red dotted line that represents the boundary of the <form> tag 
(or by clicking the <form> tag in the tag selector at the bottom of the 
work area), as shown in Figure 11-9.
 
 With the <form> tag selected, the Property inspector changes to feature 
the <form> tag options. Note: All HTML forms must be enclosed by the 
<form> tag. If your script doesn’t have a <form> tag, add one around 
the entire contents of your form by following the steps in the “Creating 
HTML Forms” section found earlier in this chapter.
 
 To select the <form> tag in Dreamweaver, place your cursor anywhere 
in the body of your form and then use the tag selector at the bottom of 
the work area to select the <form> tag. Make sure you’ve selected the 
<form> tag and not just one of the form elements, such as the text box I 
created in this form for comments.
 
Figure 11-9: 
You can 
use the tag 
selector to 
select the 
<form> tag 
and display 
form proper-
ties in the 
Property 
inspector.
 

333
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
2. In the Property inspector, give your form a name.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically gives each form you create a distinct name 
(form1, form2, and so on) — but I prefer to change the name to some-
thing that has more meaning, such as contact for this contact form. You 
can name your form whatever you like; just don’t use spaces or special 
characters.
 
3. Specify the action for the form.
 
 For the formmail.pl script used in this example (as well as many 
other scripts you might use), the action is simply the path to the script’s 
location on your server. In Figure 11-10, you can see that I’ve entered 
the address /cgi-bin/formmail.pl. The address you enter depends 
on your service provider; a common convention is to call the folder 
where CGI scripts are stored cgi-bin. The last part of the address 
(formmail.pl) is the name of the script. (In this case, it’s a Perl script, 
indicated by the .pl extension.)
 
 You can only use the Browse button (the yellow folder icon in the 
Property inspector) to enter an address automatically in the Action field 
if you’re working on a live server — and Dreamweaver has identified the 
location of your script — or if you have the script on your local system 
in the same directory structure that exists on your server. In most cases, 
it’s simplest just to ask your service provider or programmer for the 
address and type it in the Action field.
 
Figure 11-10: 
In the 
Action field, 
enter the 
path to the 
script.
 
 
4. In the Method field, use the drop-down arrow to choose Get, Post, or 
Default.
 
 Again, what you choose depends on your script, but Dreamweaver’s 
default is Post. If you’re using a script, such as formmail, which is fea-
tured in the final sections of this chapter, the best option is Post.
 
 The Get option is generally used for nondestructive, safe form transac-
tions that may be repeated, such as those done with a search engine. 
Transactions with the Get option are generally stored in the log files 
on a server and in a browser’s history files, so this option isn’t recom-
mended for sensitive data, such as financial information. The Post 
option is generally used for transactions that occur only once — such 

334
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
as sending an e-mail with the data from a form, registering for a service, 
or unsubscribing to a newsletter. The Post option can also handle larger 
chunks of data than Get.
 
5. Click the Target option to specify what the browser does when the 
submit action is completed.
 
 If you choose _blank, the results page opens in a new browser window. 
If you leave this field blank, the browser window is simply replaced with 
the results page. A results page is usually a simple HTML page with a 
message (such as Thanks for playing) delivered when the Submit button 
is clicked.
 
6. Use the Enctype field to specify how the data is formatted when it’s 
returned (see Figure 11-11).
 
 For example, if you’re using a form mail script, the Enctype field deter-
mines how the text appears in your e-mail when the contents of the form 
are sent to you. By default, this field is blank.
 
Figure 11-11: 
Enter a 
type in the 
Enctype 
field. 
 
7. Use the Class field at the far right of the Property inspector to apply a 
CSS style to the form.
 
 In this example, I applied CSS to some elements in the form, such as the 
text, but not to the entire form.
That takes care of all the options in the Property inspector. You still have one 
more task, however: inserting a hidden form field into this form to make it 
work with the formmail.pl script, as shown in the next exercise.
Using hidden fields
Many scripts, including the formmail.pl script, require the use of hidden 
fields — fields that hold data you want associated with a form but not shown 
to visitors to a site (such as the e-mail address to which a form is sent when 
a visitor clicks the Submit button). To insert and use a hidden field, follow 
these steps:

335
 Chapter 11: Forms Follow Function
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted the <form> tag (which appears as a red 
dotted line around your form), follow the steps in the first exercise in 
the “Creating HTML Forms” section before continuing with this exercise.
 
 Even though the hidden field doesn’t appear in the form area, make sure 
that it’s inside the <form> tag before you add a hidden field. Placing 
your cursor at the top or bottom of the form area before inserting a 
hidden field is a good option because it makes the hidden field easier to 
find in the HTML code.
 
 After the hidden field is inserted into the <form> tag, the Property inspec-
tor changes to feature the Hidden Field options (shown in Figure 11-12).
 
2. In the Property inspector, enter a name.
 
 If you’re using formmail.pl, you’d enter recipient as the name and the 
e-mail address where you want the form data sent as the value. You can 
even enter more than one e-mail address, separated by commas. So, for 
example, I could enter janine@jcwarner.com, janine@digitalfamily.com 
in the Value field, and the data from the form would be e-mailed to both 
these e-mail addresses when a user clicks the Submit button (as shown 
in Figure 11-12.)
 
Figure 11-12: 
The Hidden 
Field prop-
erties. 
 
3. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag and then click the 
Hidden Field icon in the Forms Insert Bar to add another hidden field 
to create a subject line.
 
4. In the Property inspector, enter the name subject; in the Value field, 
include a subject line you want inserted into the e-mail message auto-
matically when a user submits the form.
 
 In this example, I entered Contact Information from DigitalFamily.com 
as the value.
 
 You can add many other hidden fields to a form, depending on the script 
you’re using and on how much you want to customize the results.
That’s it. Assuming all fields are filled in correctly and formmail.pl (or 
a similar script) is properly installed and configured on your server, you 
should receive via e-mail any data a user enters into your form and submits.

Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
There are many reasons to create forms on the Web, but e-mailing the con-
tents of a contact form is one of the most common. I hope this little exercise 
has helped give you an idea of what to do to make your HTML forms interact 
with a CGI script on your server.
 
Most service providers offer a collection of scripts you can use to create 
forms for common features of Web sites, such as guest books and contact 
forms. All you have to do is create the HTML part of the form and then specify 
the form fields to interact with the script on your server. Check the Web site 
of your Web-hosting service for instructions specific to the scripts available 
on your server.
Using form validation to check data
When you create a form, it’s good practice to 
include features that validate the form as a 
user submits it. For example, you can use form 
validation to ensure that a user has entered an 
e-mail address in a text field. If they have not, 
you can return the form with a message stating 
that the e-mail address field is required.
You can set up validation for forms in many 
ways, but the simplest way in Dreamweaver 
is to use the Spry form fields, which I cover in 
more detail on my Web site at DigitalFamily.

I
f you still think AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is just some-
thing you can use to clean the house, you’re missing out on one of 
the greatest innovations in Web design. On the Internet, AJAX combines 
JavaScript and XML to create highly interactive features, such as drop-down 
menus and panels that can be opened and closed without reloading a Web 
page.
To make it easier to create these advanced features, Dreamweaver includes 
a collection of widgets known as the Spry Framework. Even if you don’t know 
how to write JavaScript, XML, or CSS, you can use to Spry add AJAX features to 
your Web pages, such as drop-down menus (like the one shown in Figure 12-1), 
collapsible and tabbed panels, and form validation features, which I cover in 
this chapter.

Making Magic with AJAX
Web designers are all a buzz about AJAX because it enables you to create 
more interactive pages that load faster than similar pages created with previ-
ous Web technologies. AJAX also enables designers to add features that a 
Web page visitor can change without having to reload the entire page.
For example, at the highly popular iGoogle page of the Google search engine 
(available at www.igoogle.com), AJAX enables you to open and close the 
weather box, calendar, and other features on the site, as well as move boxes 
around the page without reloading the page. Although iGoogle is a very 
advanced example of AJAX, it’s a great example of what’s possible.
Dreamweaver’s Spry features are designed to make it easy to create some 
of these kinds of features, such as panels that open and close, the way the 
weather content box on iGoogle opens or closes.
To save you from having to write the code for these kinds of features your-
self, Dreamweaver includes a collection of widgets that instantly adds things 
like collapsible panels and drop-down menus to your pages, and includes 
editing tools for customizing these features without knowing JavaScript. To 
view the list of AJAX widgets available in Dreamweaver, open the Spry Insert 
panel by choosing Spry from the Insert panel drop-down menu shown in 
Figure 12-2.

options.
 
Creating Drop-Down Menus with AJAX
An increasingly popular option for navigation bars, drop-down menus can 
provide a menu (or list) of links to the main sections of a Web site, with a 
secondary menu of links to the subcategories within those sections. You can 
even create a third layer with the Spry Menu Bar widget.
 
With the Dreamweaver Spry Menu Bar, you can create menus that span hori-
zontally or vertically. As you see in the following steps, you simply choose 
which way you want the menu to span when you insert it from the Spry menu.
To create a drop-down menu with the Spry Menu Bar widget, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Place your cursor on a page where you want the menu to appear.
 
 If you haven’t already saved your page, make sure you save it before 
adding Spry features, or Dreamweaver will prompt you with a warning 
message that you need to do so.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Menu Bar.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Menu Bar option in the Spry Insert 
panel, visible in Figure 12-3.
 
 The Spry Menu Bar dialog box appears.

340
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
3. In the Spry Menu Bar dialog box, choose Horizontal or Vertical.
 
 Horizontal creates a menu that drops down into a page; Vertical creates 
a menu that opens out to the right.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 A menu with four items and several subitems is created and inserted 
into the page.
 
5. Enter your own text for the menu items.
 
 You can edit the text for the top-level items in the main workspace by 
simply clicking and dragging to select the generic text, such as Item1, 
and then typing to replace it.
 
 In general, making changes to menu bar items in the Property inspec-
tor is best. I explain how in the remaining steps. To change formatting 
options, such as color, font face, and size, make changes to the style 
sheet rules, described in Step 14.
 
6. Click the blue Menu Bar tab on the top of the menu bar you inserted 
in the design area to display the settings in the Property inspector, as 
shown in Figure 12-3.
 
 You find settings to add, remove, edit, and change the order of items 
and subitems in the Property inspector.

Click the 
blue Menu 
Bar tab to

341
 Chapter 12: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
 
7. To change the name of an item or subitem, click to select the item in 
the Property inspector and then type a new name in the Text field on 
the far-right side of the Property inspector, as shown in Figures 12-3 
and 12-4.
 
8. To link a menu item, select the item name and enter a URL in the Link 
field or click the Browse button (which looks like a file folder), and 
select the page you want to link to (see Figure 12-4).
 
9. To remove an item, select it and then click the minus (–) sign at the 
top of the field in the Property inspector.
 
 A deleted item is removed from the menu in the Property inspector as 
well as the main work area.
 
10. To add an item, select the plus (+) sign at the top of the item field in 
the Property inspector.
 
 When you add an item, it appears in the Property inspector menu as 
well as in the menu bar in the main work area. 
 
11. To add a subitem, select the item you want the subitem to appear 
under and then click the plus (+) sign in the item box to the right of 
the selected item (refer to Figure 12-3).
 
12. To change the order of items, click to select an item name and then 
use the arrows at the top of each item box.
 
 Items move up and down the menu when you click the up or down 
arrows. Items appear in the Web page in the order they appear in the 
Property inspector.

Edit any item 
selected in 
the Property 
inspector

Text, Link, 
Title, and 
Target 
fields.
 
 
13. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 You must upload these files to your Web server when you upload the 
Web page for the Spry features to work.

342
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
14. To change the appearance of a drop-down menu, edit the correspond-
ing CSS style rules.
 
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) style rules determine the text size, font, 
background color, and other formatting features. When you create a 
menu bar, a collection of CSS styles are generated automatically and 
saved in an external CSS file dubbed SpryMenuBarHorizontal.CSS 
(for horizontal menus) or SpryMenuBarVertical.CSS (for verti-
cal menus). You can access these styles through the CSS Styles panel, 
shown in Figure 12-5.
 
 Here are a few examples of how Spry menu bar styles can be edited:
 
a. To change the font size or face, double-click the style name 
ul.MenuBarHorizontal and alter the corresponding Type cat-
egory settings. In the example, shown here, I’ve changed the font 
size to 90 percent, which will make the text in the menu display at 
90 percent of the size of the default text setting for the page.
 
b. You can remove or edit the border of a menu bar by editing the 
border settings in the style ul.MenuBarHorizontal ul. (In the 
example shown here, I removed the border by simply deleting all 
the settings for the border.)
 
c. You can change the text and background colors for the 
active links (effectively changing the colors of the menu bar 
when the page first loads) by changing the colors for the rule 
ul.MenuBarHorizontal a.
 
 To find other settings you may want to change, click to select each 
of the style names in the Spry Menu Bar style sheet and use the CSS 
Properties pane, in the lower half of the CSS Styles panel, to view the 
rules that have been defined for each style. By simply clicking through 
the collection of styles, you can identify each of the settings in a drop-
down menu (or any other Spry feature) and determine where you’ll need 
to edit them to change the appearance of each element. You find more 
detailed instructions for creating and editing style rules in Chapters 5 
and 6.
 
 15. Click the globe icon at the top of the workspace to preview your work 
in a browser.
 
 
 Here you can see how the styles appear in the menu and test the drop-
down effects and links.
 
 The example in Figure 12-6 is in the Firefox browser.

Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Creating Collapsible Panels
The Spry Collapsible Panel option makes it easy to add panels that can be 
opened or closed on a Web page. This AJAX feature enables you to make 
better use of the space on a page by making it easy to display more informa-
tion in less space within a browser window.
In Figures 12-6, you can see how I used collapsible panels to contain the biog-
raphy of each partner and consultant in a consulting firm. The result is that 
you can easily see the names of all the consultants on one page. To view a 
consultant’s bio, a user need only click the tab at the top of the panel (where 
the consultant’s name appears), and the panel opens instantly. In Figure 12-6 
you can see that the bio for Designer Davi Cheng is open while the others on 
the page are all closed. The beauty of AJAX is that the page doesn’t have to 
be reloaded for the panels to open or close. Click once on a tab and a panel 
opens instantly. If a user clicks the tab again, the panel closes. Collapsible 
panels can be used to display text and images. You can also include multime-
dia files in panels, such as audio, video, and Flash files.
 
When you create collapsible panels with the Spry menu in Dreamweaver, 
you can set the panels so that they’re closed or opened when a page is first 
loaded. Because each panel is created separately, you can create a page that 
displays all panels open, all panels closed, or a mix of the two options.
Follow these steps to create a collapsible panel:
 
1. Place your cursor on a page where you want the collapsible panel to 
appear.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Collapsible Panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Collapsible Panel icon in the Spry 
Insert panel, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
 A Spry collapsible panel appears in the page, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
3. Click and drag to select the word Tab and replace it with the text you 
want to appear in the panel’s Tab area.
 
 By default, the text in the Tab area is bold, but you can change that by 
altering the corresponding CSS rule.

345
 Chapter 12: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
 
Figure 12-7:

Collapsible 
Panel option

panel to a 
Web page, 
but you can 
use it mul-
tiple times 
to create 
a series of 
panels.
 
 
4. Click to select the word Content in the main area of the panel and 
enter any text or images you want to display.
 
 You can copy text into a panel by pasting it just as you’d paste text 
anywhere else on the page. Similarly, you insert images into panels 
just as you would anywhere else on a page by choosing Insert➪Image 
and selecting the GIF, JPEG, or PNG file you want to display. (Chapter 
3 covers images on the Web if you need help preparing or converting 
images into these formats.)
 
 When you paste text into a panel, choose Edit➪Paste Special to choose 
the amount of formatting you want to preserve in the text you paste 
in Dreamweaver. Limiting the amount of formatting preserved can cut 
down on potential style conflicts.
 
5. Click the blue Spry Collapsible Panel tab at the top of the panel in the 
design area. 
 
 When you correctly click the blue tab, the panel settings immediately 
appear in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 12-7. Click any-
where else on the page, and the inspector returns to its default settings.

346
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
6. From the Display drop-down menu in the Property inspector, choose 
Closed.
 
 The Closed option immediately closes the panel in the main workspace 
in Dreamweaver. This setting only affects the way the panel displays in 
the Dreamweaver workspace.
 
7. From the Default State drop-down menu in the Property inspector, 
choose Closed.
 
 This setting controls how the panel displays in a Web browser. Choosing 
Closed means the panel is closed when the page loads. If you choose 
Open, the panel appears open when the page is loaded.
 
8. Make sure the Enable Animation check box is selected if you want the 
panel to open and close when a user clicks the tab.
 
9. To change the appearance of the panel, such as the font face or color, 
edit the corresponding CSS rule.
 
 For example, to edit the background color of the tab, or the font face, 
style, or color, select the .CollapsiblePanelTab style and alter the 
settings in the Properties panel in the lower half of the CSS Styles panel, 
as shown in Figure 12-8. Alternatively, you can double-click any style 
name to launch the CSS Rule Definition dialog box to make your changes 
there. You find more detailed instructions for creating and editing styles 
in Chapters 5 and 6.
 
10. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 You must upload these files to your Web server when you upload the 
Web page for the Spry features to work.

Creating Tabbed Panels
The Spry Tabbed Panel option makes it easy to add a series of panels that 
display or hide content corresponding to a series of tabs, as shown in Figure 
12-9. Similar to the collapsible panels, this AJAX feature lets you display more 
information in less space within a browser window.
Similar to the collapsible panels, tabbed panels can be used to display text, 
images, and multimedia.
 
When you create tabbed panels with the Spry menu in Dreamweaver, you can 
control the order of the tabs, effectively controlling what content appears 
when the page is first loaded.
 
Figure 12-9:

Follow these steps to create a tabbed panel:
 
1. Place your cursor on a page where you want the tabbed panel to 
appear.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Tabbed Panels.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Tabbed Panels icon in the Spry 
Insert panel, as shown in Figure 12-10.
 
 A Spry tabbed panel appears on the page, as shown in Figure 12-10.
 
3. Click and drag to select the word Tab in the main workspace and 
replace it with the text you want to appear in the panel’s Tab area.
 
 You can edit the contents of the tabs only in the workspace, not in the 
Property inspector.
 
 By default, the text in the Tab area is bold and black, but you can change 
that by altering the corresponding CSS rule.
 
4. Click the blue Spry Tabbed Panels tab at the top of the panel set in the 
design area.
 
 When you correctly click the blue tab, the settings immediately appear in 
the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 12-10. Click outside the blue 
boxed area, and the Property inspector returns to its default settings.

 Chapter 12: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
 
5. To add tabs, click the plus (+) icon in the Property inspector, as shown 
in Figure 12-10.
 
 New tabs appear in the workspace.
 
6. To change the order of tabs, click to select the tab name in the 
Property inspector and then use the arrows in the Panels field to 
move the panel.
 
 Panel names move up and down the menu as the order is changed. 
Panels and their corresponding tabs appear in the Web page in the 
order they appear in the Property inspector.
 
7. Use the Default Panel drop-down menu to choose the tab you want to 
display when the page is first loaded into a Web browser.
 
 The drop-down menu corresponds to the names you give each tab in the 
workspace.
 
8. To add content, select the word Content in the main area of any 
selected tab panel and enter text, images, or multimedia.
 
 You can copy text into a panel by pasting it just as you’d paste text 
anywhere else on the page. Similarly, insert images into panels just as 
you would anywhere else on a page by choosing Insert➪Image and then 
selecting the GIF, JPEG, or PNG file you want to display. You can also 
add multimedia, such as Flash video files. (Find instructions for adding 
multimedia to Web pages in Chapter 10.)
 
9. To change the appearance of a tab or a panel, such as the font face or 
color, edit the corresponding CSS rule.
 
 For example, to edit the background color of the tabs, click to select the 
.TabbedPanelsTab style and alter the settings in the Properties panel 
in the lower half of the CSS Styles panel. Alternatively, you can double-
click any style name to launch the CSS Rule Definition dialog box to 
make your changes there. You find more detailed instructions for creat-
ing and editing styles in Chapters 5 and 6.
 
 In tabbed panels styles, the tab background colors are controlled 
by two different styles — the .TabbedPanelsTab and the 
.TabbedPanelsTabSelected styles. As a result, you can specify a dif-
ferent background color and other formatting settings to distinguish the 
tab that’s selected from the tabs that aren’t selected.
 
10. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 You must upload these files to your Web server when you upload the 
Web page for the Spry features to work.
 
 11. Click the globe icon at the top of the workspace to preview your work 
in a browser.

Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Using Spry Validation Widgets
The Spry menu also includes a collection of validation widgets you can use to 
create form elements with built-in validation features. For example, you can 
use the Text Field Validation widget to verify whether a visitor has filled in a 
specified minimum number of characters — a handy way to ensure that some-
one has filled in all the digits in a phone number or Social Security number. 
You can also add hints to a text field to provide additional instructions.
Similarly, you can use the Validation Checkbox widget to verify that a check 
box has been selected. This is common, for example, when you have a legal 
disclaimer or contract and want to ensure that a visitor selects the Accept box 
before progressing into another area of your site, as shown in Figure 12-11.
To use these widgets, click to select the Spry validation option you want to 
use, such as the Spry Validation Text Area or the Spry Validation Checkbox 
(see Figure 12-11). If you have not already inserted the HTML form tag, 
Dreamweaver offers to do it for you. (You find more instructions for creating 
form elements in Chapter 11).
To use the Spry Validation Checkbox Wizard to require that users select one 
or more check boxes on a Web page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor in the page where you want the checkbox 
to appear.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Validation Checkbox.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Validation Checkbox icon in the 
Spry Insert panel.
 
3. If you are not adding the check box to an area that already includes a 
form tag, the Add Form Tag dialog box opens. To create the form tag 
as you create the text box, click Yes.
 
4. Specify validation requirements in the Property inspector.
 
 When you add a validation widget to a form element, such as the check 
box shown in this example, the Property inspector automatically dis-
plays the properties for that validation option. If those properties aren’t 
visible, click the blue Spry tab just above the form element to display 
them.
 
5. To require that users select a check box, choose Required from the 
Preview States drop-down menu in the Property inspector.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically adds Please Make a Selection, just to the 
right of the check box in the workspace. You can edit this text by select-
ing it in the workspace and typing any message you want, such as, You 
must accept our policy to continue.

351
 Chapter 12: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
 
 The validation message displays only if a visitor fails to select the check 
box before clicking the Submit button.
 
6. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 For the Spry features work, you must upload these files to your Web 
server when you upload the Web page.
 
 
7. Click the globe icon at the top of the workspace to preview your work 
in a browser where you can test the validation features.

Creating Dynamic Web Sites
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding dynamic Web sites
▶ Comparing blogs and other content management systems
▶ Reviewing advanced Web technology such as PHP and ASP.Net
▶ Setting up your computer for dynamic Web pages
▶ Reviewing Dreamweaver’s data connection and related features
B
efore you start down the path of working on a dynamic Web site, let me 
warn you of two things. First, creating a dynamic Web site is far more 
complex than creating the static-page Web sites described in the rest of this 
book. Second, there is no way I can possibly cover everything you’d need to 
know to create a dynamic site as complex as Amazon.com or CNN.com in one 
book.
But don’t despair! Thousands of programmers have done the heavy lifting to 
build open-source (that is, free) code for dynamic sites, and Dreamweaver 
is the perfect tool to take an “off-the-shelf” dynamic site and customize it to 
make it really your own. 
This chapter shows you how dynamic sites work, why they’re important, and 
how Dreamweaver can be used to create and edit them. You also find a review 
of the most common technologies used to create dynamic sites — PHP, ASP.Net, 
ColdFusion, and JSP — and an explanation of how these technologies are used to 
create everything from Disney.com to blogging programs like WordPress. At the 
end of this chapter, you find an introduction to Dreamweaver’s most advanced 
features, which are designed for developing and editing dynamic Web sites.
Although most of this book focuses on creating static page sites, the skills 
you try out throughout this book — such as how to optimize images for the 
Web and how to create Cascading Styles Sheets — apply equally well to both 
static and dynamic Web sites. (In Chapter 1, you find a comparison of static 
and dynamic sites and the templates used in each of these site types.) 

354
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
If you want to get further into using the most advanced Dreamweaver features 
introduced in this chapter, you can find more information in Dreamweaver CS5 
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Sue Jenkins, Michele E. Davis, and 
Jon A. Phillips; or Dreamweaver CS5 Bible, by Joseph Lowery (Wiley).
Understanding Dynamic Web Sites
Dynamic Web sites are so powerful because you can draw information out of 
a data source (such as a database), as a visitor arrives at your Web site and 
use it to create a new Web page in real time, that responds to the visitor — 
that is, a dynamic page. The ability to create Web pages on the fly is what 
enables a site to show a page featuring books on dog costumes to one visitor 
and show a page with books about dancing cats to another visitor.
In addition to databases, you can use other data sources (such as XML files 
or RSS feeds) to display data dynamically. You can also combine multiple 
sources to create one very complex page. For example, the pages you see on 
many news sites (such as CNN) combine information from articles that come 
from one data source with advertising that comes from another. Connecting 
different data sources to the same Web page enables CNN to produce up-to-
date news pages with breaking news and the latest weather report, as well as 
ever-changing advertising, because they create each page on-the-fly as visi-
tors arrive at the site.
A simple example of a dynamic Web site feature is a search engine, which 
works (generally) like this:
 
1. You type what you want to find into a search field.
 
2. When you submit your request, that information is passed from your 
Web browser to a database (using a script or Web technology), written 
in a programming language such as PHP.
 
3. That same script, or one that works cooperatively with it, then com-
pares what you entered into the search field with the contents of the 
database and returns a list of results that are displayed in a single page. 
Thus, the information that a visitor enters results in a unique, dynami-
cally generated Web page with a list of results that are relevant (ideally, 
anyway!) to the search request.
 
If you’re starting to think you’ll never be able to add dynamic features to your 
Web site, take heart in the fact that more and more services save you the 
complex programming needed to add these kinds of high-end features. For 
example, the easiest way to add search to a Web site (even a static-page site) 
is Google’s free search engine. You can download a snippet of code from the 
Google Web site and add it to your own site for free, effectively adding a com-
plex search engine on your site, even if you’re not a programmer. Visit www.
google.com/cse for details.

 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
Appreciating dynamic sites’ advantages
A dynamic Web site has many advantages beyond the capability to search 
another Web site. Suppose you have a Web site where you sell 657 kinds of 
candy. Here’s how a static site stacks up against a dynamic site:
 
✓ With a dynamic Web site, you create just one page template with the 
design for your candy products pages — and then you add special code 
that dynamically pulls product name, image, description, and any other 
pertinent information from a database and displays it in that one page 
template each time a visitor requests one of the 657 kinds of candy. That 
means you don’t actually have 657 pages, you have one template and a 
database full of content. That allows you to update, sort, mix and match 
your candy data — whenever and however you want — to create a virtu-
ally infinite number of pages that exist only as long as visitors to your 
site are viewing them.
 
✓ On a static Web site, you’d have to create 657 pages, one for each 
candy product. If you ever wanted to change the way those pages look, 
you’d have to change all 657 pages. Although using Dreamweaver tem-
plates (covered in Chapter 7) will get you some of the same advantages 
you’d get from a dynamic site — such as doing some global updates to 
common parts of a page — you still have to go through each and every 
one of those 657 distinct pages, and then upload all of them to your Web 
server. 
When you compare the two types of site, dynamic Web sites clearly offer 
advantages to site owners who have a lot of data, such as items for sale, to 
display in a consistent format:
 
✓ A dynamic site saves time because you don’t have to create individual 
pages for every product or for every different type of product listing. 
With a dynamic site, you invest more time upfront, but if you’re work-
ing on a site that’s more than 100 pages or so, the dynamic approach is 
probably more efficient in the long run.
 
✓ Dynamic sites enable you to display the same product information in 
different combinations. So, for example, you could create one template 
that displayed only the name and photo of each kind of candy in a long 
list, and then another template that displayed all the product informa-
tion for each type of candy, including a detailed description, pricing 
information, additional photos, and so on. (If you’ve ever shopped on 
Amazon.com or Godiva.com, you’re familiar with the concept.) You 
could also create one page that listed only chocolate candy and another 
that listed jelly beans. One big advantage is that if you change the name 
of a candy bar, you simply change the name once in the database, and 
it’s automatically changed on all the pages created from that entry in the 
database.

356
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
✓ Dynamic sites enable you to create links between pages with related 
information — automatically — so visitors can drill down to find the 
details they want. For example, you can set up one template that is 
designed to display the kinds of candy you sell, but specify that only ten 
items should appear on each page. Your dynamic site will then respond 
automatically — generating as many pages as needed to display all your 
products (at ten per page), and linking each page to the next. If you add 
more products to the database, the system generates more pages as 
needed, also automatically.
Considering the disadvantages 
of a dynamic Web site
Before you get too excited about all the advantages of a dynamic Web site, 
keep in mind the few disadvantages as well. Dynamic sites are harder to 
develop and require much more advanced skills to create and maintain. 
They can also be more expensive to host on a commercial service provider 
because they require more resources, and software, on your Web server.
Then consider that all the advantages of being able to replicate pages quickly 
come with the disadvantage that you can’t vary the designs as much from 
page to page. That’s one of the reasons that so many blogs have such a 
similar look. Although you can change the design in a dynamic site on every 
page, it’s much harder to develop the page designs, and the more variations 
Comparing server-side versus client-side scripts
Two types of dynamic Web technology exist: 
Web pages created with server-side scripting 
and those created with client-side scripting.
Client-side scripting can be executed on the 
client — which (for our purposes) means it’s 
done in the Web browser on your computer. 
For example, the rollover behaviors covered 
in Chapter 9 and the drop-down menus cov-
ered in Chapter 12 both make substantial use 
of JavaScript to make images and links change 
dynamically on a Web page. Those changes are 
handled on your computer by function calls to 
your processor, memory, and video card. Client-
side scripts enable you to create some very 
cool features, but their uses are more limited 
than those of server-side scripts.
Server-side scripting is installed and exe-
cuted on a Web server. This chapter focuses 
on the kinds of dynamic sites you can create 
with server-side scripting — which enables 
a dynamic site to function with far more com-
plexity — for example, pulling data from more 
than one data source to give potential custom-
ers on an e-commerce site custom-tailored 
recommendations based on the search terms 
they enter, as well as on the company’s current 
inventory. An example is a message that says 
something like, “You looked for jelly beans, and 
we think you might also like the jelly bean bou-
quets we have on sale this week.”
 

357
 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
on the design, the less efficient it is. Thus, when you create a dynamic Web 
site, what you save in automation, you give up in design control. If you want 
to create a site with really great, interesting, and varied designs, you may be 
best served by a static page design. As a general rule, any site with less than 
10 or 20 pages is almost certainly better (and more easily) created as a static 
site. And although I generally recommend that you graduate to a dynamic 
site after your site grows to more than 100 pages, I have managed static sites 
as big as 3,000 pages using Dreamweaver’s templates.
Blogs are dynamic sites, too
Many people are confused by the difference between a Web site and blog. 
Essentially a blog is just a special kind of dynamic Web site, often called a 
content management system (CMS) because it’s used to manage content (all 
those blog posts, pictures, and comments). Many content management sys-
tems are in use on the Web today. The open source programs Joomla! and 
Drupal are among some of the most popular, but blogs are designed to be so 
easy, even actors and politicians can use them.
The advantage of a blog is that you can start your blog site with all the 
dynamic functionality prebuilt for you. Seemingly all you have to do with 
most blog programs (including Blogger, WordPress, and TypePad) is set up 
an account and then add your own words and pictures. Most people find 
blogging as easy as using a word processor. (And it can be, except that a lot 
is happening behind the scenes.)
From a technical standpoint, blogs combine upfront functionality with back-
stage administrative tools — both of which work dynamically. On the front 
end, the dynamic technology pulls content from a database to display to visi-
tors to the blog. On the back end, dynamic technology enables bloggers to 
use any Web browser to enter headlines, images, and text into the database. 
(See my example of how a blog works in the next section.)
Blogging enables people who aren’t programmers to create sites easily, using 
some of the most advanced technology on the Web. The result is a paradox: 
It’s easier to create a blog than a static site (and super easy to post articles 
and photos), but much harder to edit the design of a blog than a static site.
This seeming contradiction makes a little more sense if you can compare set-
ting up a blog to building a house. Using a blogging program that sets up the 
underlying dynamic functionality for you is a little like buying a prefabricated 
house. With a prefab, you let someone else work out all the design and engi-
neering challenges and put together the pieces. Then all you have to do is 
move in your furniture and paint your name on the mailbox. 
You need advanced technical knowledge, however, if you’re editing the under-
lying code of a blog (or building a blog from scratch). It’s almost like build-
ing your own house by drawing your own plans and constructing it yourself. 

358
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Continuing with the prefab metaphor, when you’re working on a blog, rear-
ranging the furniture and even painting the walls isn’t that hard. But what if 
you decide you want to add on a second story or take down the wall between 
the kitchen and the dining room? Well, now, that requires an engineer who 
has to first figure out the electrical wiring and plumbing that the original 
designer put in — and then ensure that the changes you have in mind don’t 
conflict with a hidden quirk that could make a load-bearing wall collapse. 
The blog equivalent is that you need a programmer for substantive changes 
such as adding new page designs or changing the functionality of how you 
add images — and you have to make sure that all that new programming is 
set up to work properly on your Web server (which is a bit like needing per-
mits from the city to add a second story). 
Here’s a quick look at some popular ready-made blogging tools and content 
management systems:
 
✓ The simplest blogging tool: For pure ease of use and setup, Blogger.com 
is a popular choice, but you won’t have as many options for customizing 
the design or adding additional features.
 
✓ Most popular blogging tool: WordPress is by far the most popular 
blogging program among serious bloggers. WordPress is relatively 
easy to set up and administer, but it offers many additional options for 
customizing the design and adding features, which can get increasingly 
complex. Also confusing to many people, there are two ways to use 
WordPress. Visit www.WordPress.org if you want to create a free blog 
using the simplest options. Visit www.WordPress.com to take advan-
tage of the full power of the program.
 
✓ For developing more complex sites: Joomla! (www.joomla.org) and 
Drupal (www.drupal.org) offer similar advantages to blogging, but 
with more features and more flexibility. You still need the equivalent 
of an engineer (programmer) to move walls, but it gives you more of a 
head start if you want to build something more complex, like an office 
building (or online magazine).
 
✓ For adding e-commerce to a dynamic site: WordPress, Joomla!, and 
Drupal can also be paired with other programs, such as Zen Cart or OS 
Commerce, which add shopping-cart and e-commerce capabilities with 
the same replicable model.
Using Dreamweaver to edit a blog
So where does Dreamweaver fit into the creation of dynamic sites, espe-
cially blogs? Well, you can create a completely custom dynamic site with 
Dreamweaver, but these days most smart Web designers start with a pro-
gram like WordPress — and then use Dreamweaver to create and edit the 
templates that control the design. 

359
 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
The templates used in WordPress, Joomla!, and other content management 
systems are all created with XHTML and CSS (combined with more advanced 
programming), using Web technology such as a hypertext preprocessor 
(PHP) that makes everything work dynamically. Thus, the same CSS and 
XHTML skills you covered in the rest of this book apply to editing the basic 
design of WordPress templates.
Editing a WordPress template is kind of like being your own handyman: You 
don’t have to be able to rewire the entire house to replace a light fixture, but 
you need to know the basics of how wiring works or you risk electrocuting 
yourself.
Search the Web, and you’ll find thousands of templates for WordPress. 
Downloading and installing templates is relatively easy, but editing them can 
get complicated quickly. Using what you learn in Chapters 5 and 6 of this 
book, you can edit the CSS style sheets that control the appearance of your 
template pages and can change design elements, such as colors and fonts 
without advanced skills. However, keep in mind that templates you download 
from the Web come from many different designers, and the CSS may not be 
written or organized the way you (or I) might prefer. The first task in edit-
ing the CSS in a WordPress template is often deciphering how the styles are 
defined.
If you want to create your own template or change the programming code 
that specifies how data is pulled from the database, you need to learn a pro-
gramming language, such as PHP, used in most blogging programs. To help 
you keep things in perspective, most people can get the hang of XHTML and 
CSS in a couple of weeks, but many people study programming in a language 
like PHP for two or more years. 
After you have the necessary programming skills, there’s one other big chal-
lenge to making this all work: Because dynamic Web sites like WordPress use 
server-side scripts to generate pages, you need a lot more than Dreamweaver 
on your computer to make everything work. Installing WordPress on your 
hard drive is just the start — you also have to set up a Web server and other 
software on your computer before you can view dynamic Web pages. Setting 
your computer up to work as a Web server is not as hard as it sounds, but 
it’s not as easy as installing most software programs (such as Dreamweaver). 
How you do it depends on what kind of computer you’re using and what 
kind of programming was used to create the dynamic site. You find out more 
about the programming options (PHP, JSP, and so on) and about setting up a 
local Web server, later in this chapter.
 
If you just want to edit the CSS styles or make minor changes to a WordPress 
template without having to install WordPress and set up a server on your 
local computer, you can copy just the CSS file to your computer, edit it in 
Dreamweaver, and then upload it back to the server. You find tips for the sim-
plest ways to use Dreamweaver to edit WordPress templates on my Web site 
at www.DigitalFamily.com/wordpress.

Studying a dynamic site in action 
To help you better appreciate how a dynamic Web site works, this section 
takes a closer look at how a blog works. The following steps are designed to 
give you a tour of the front end, which visitors to a blog see, as well as the 
back end, which the blogger uses to add content to the database. This is a 
common way that many dynamic Web sites are built:
 
1. Point your browser to www.mobilewebdesignblog.com.
 
2. On the home page, you see the first part of the most recent post in the 
database for this site, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
My Mobile 
Web Design 
blog’s 
front page 
displays 
the first 
couple of 
paragraphs 
for each 
post in the 
database. 
Each head-
line links to 
a complete 
post.
 
 
3. Click the headline on the front page and the browser displays a new 
page, created dynamically, which displays the entire post.
 
 You can also click the link at the bottom of the text that reads Click to 
Continue Reading, as you can see in Figure 13-1.
 
 When you view pages like this, keep in mind that there’s really only 
one copy of the article stored in the database. When you click a linked 
headline, the PHP technology pulls the complete post from the database, 
inserts it into the same template, and displays it as a new page in the 
Web browser in place of the page that displayed the link you clicked. 
Another advantage of blogging programs is they can set these links for 
you automatically. Thus, you simply enter a story into the system and the 
program automatically turns the headline into a link and inserts the text 
Click here to continue reading with a link to the full version of the story. 

361
 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
Behind the scenes of this same blog is a set of administrative pages, also 
generated dynamically. (See Figure 13-2.) As the author of the blog, I use 
the administrative pages to enter headlines, articles, images, and even 
specify how much of the story I want to appear on the front page before the 
link to the full story. The administrative tools (or in WordPress terms, the 
Dashboard) is the interface I use to enter information into the database. That 
information is then displayed on the front-end page, according to the settings 
in the blog software.

Creating Dynamic Sites: Key Concepts
When you create dynamic Web sites, you need one program to create the 
data source (which is usually a database or an XML file) and another pro-
gram or Web technology to connect the data source to your Web pages. In 
the sections that follow, you find a description of the five technologies that 
Dreamweaver supports for creating dynamic sites: PHP, JSP, ASP, ASP.NET, 
and ColdFusion.
There are many types of data sources. The most powerful option is a high-
end database, such as MySQL, but you can also use simpler database pro-
grams, including Microsoft Access. XML files, which are specially designed 
text files, can also be used a data sources. WordPress, like many blogs, com-
bines a MySQL database with PHP.

362
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Comparing options for dynamic 
Web site development
One of the most complicated aspects of how dynamic sites work is how 
you set up the connection between the Web site that your visitor’s see and 
the data source that contains all your articles, images, and other content. 
Essentially, this puzzle has three pieces: the data source, the Web server, and 
the Web technology that makes the two work together.
There are many ways to set up this connection. You can create a very simple 
script using a programming language like Java, or you can create a highly 
complex combination of programs that work in tandem to complete many 
tasks simultaneously. For example, displaying XML data on a Web page 
requires a relatively simple program. A far more complex setup collects 
information about a user’s shopping habits and then compares that with data 
from multiple sources before generating a Web page specific to the visitor. 
Depending on the complexity of the dynamic site and the data source, you 
may also need an application server, as well as a Web server and a database.
Dreamweaver supports five popular technologies that can be used to connect 
a data source to a Web site (described in detail in the following sections):
 
✓ Active Server Pages (ASP)
 
✓ ASP.NET
 
✓ JavaServer Pages (JSP)
 
✓ Adobe ColdFusion
 
✓ PHP (which stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor — a recursive acro-
nym, for you wordsmiths)
Although all five vary in technical specifications and requirements, they offer 
similar functionality:
 
✓ All provide the capability to generate Web pages dynamically.
 
✓ All can be used to connect your Web site to a database or other data 
source.
 
✓ Using server-side code, all can display information from a database and 
create XHTML based on certain criteria — such as the actions or data 
entered by a visitor to your site.
Although I don’t recommend any one of these options over another, one 
consideration is important: Make sure that your choice works on your Web 
server. Not all Web servers are set up to handle each and every one of these 
technologies. The following descriptions are designed to help you make a 
more informed decision about which option best serves your needs.

363
 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
ASP
Extension: .asp
Although Microsoft recommends that you replace ASP (Active Server 
Pages, the first Microsoft server-side script engine for dynamically gener-
ated Web pages) with ASP.NET, many active sites on the Web still use ASP. 
ASP was built into the Windows 2003 Server, Windows 2000, Windows 
XP Professional, and Windows Vista at no additional cost. ASP can also 
be used with other Microsoft development tools such as IIS (Internet 
Information Services) or Personal Web Server (which is useful for build-
ing and testing your Web site on your local hard drive). ASP isn’t a stand-
alone programming language; much of the code you write for ASP pages 
is in VBScript or JScript (Microsoft’s version of JavaScript). You can check 
out www.4guysfromrolla.com to find out more about ASP in what more 
closely resembles plain English.
ASP.NET
Extension: .aspx
ASP.NET is Microsoft’s replacement for ASP. According to Microsoft, ASP.
NET “is a unified Web development model that includes the services neces-
sary for you to build enterprise-class Web applications with a minimum of 
coding. ASP.NET is part of the .NET Framework, and when coding ASP.NET 
applications you have access to classes in the .NET Framework.”
ASP.NET isn’t a programming language itself, but a framework within which 
you can code applications in any language that’s compatible with the 
common language runtime (CLR). These languages include Microsoft Visual 
Basic, C#, JScript .NET, and J#. ASP.NET isn’t just an upgrade of ASP, either; 
it’s a complete redesign of the framework. You can find more information at 
msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net and www.asp.net.
Adobe ColdFusion
Extension: .cfm
According to Adobe, ColdFusion software enables developers to build, 
deploy, and maintain Internet applications. You can use ColdFusion to 
create a variety of highly complex dynamic Web sites. Because Adobe 
owns ColdFusion, it is integrated into Dreamweaver better than the other 
options, and ColdFusion is probably the easiest to learn because it includes 
custom tags designed to simplify setting up common features of a dynamic 
site. ColdFusion is similar to JSP (like JSP, it’s ultimately based on Java). 
ColdFusion also includes built-in XML processing. The biggest limitation: You 
need special server software for ColdFusion, which is expensive to run your-
self and not offered by all Web hosting companies. You can read more about 
ColdFusion at www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion.

364
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
JavaServer Pages (JSP)
Extension: .jsp
According to Oracle, JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology provides a simpli-
fied, fast way to create dynamic Web content. JSP technology enables rapid 
development of Web-based applications that are server- and platform-
independent. With JSP, you can create and keep the dynamic code separate 
from the HTML pages — or you can embed the JSP code into the page. Unless 
you’re a hardcore programmer, however, this language isn’t for you. JSP is 
horribly complex. You can find out more about JSP at http://java.sun.
com/products/jsp.
PHP
Extension: .php
PHP is a popular scripting language that is especially suited for Web develop-
ment and can be embedded into HTML. Many open-source programs, such 
as WordPress and Joomla!, are built using PHP. Because it works on most 
Web servers and because so much free support is available, PHP is a favorite 
among Web programmers. PHP is most often used with databases created 
with MySQL (a popular open-source database program). PHP is right at home 
on UNIX-based servers. However, you can download Windows binaries from 
www.php.net to run Apache (server software typically used with PHP) from 
any version of Windows. The PHP scripting language is based on C, Perl, and 
Java. Check out PHP and MySQL For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Janet Valade to 
learn more or visit www.php.net.
Setting up your computer to work 
with dynamic Web pages
Another challenge when it comes to creating dynamic sites is that you can’t 
just preview dynamic Web pages the way you can preview the static pages 
using nothing but a Web browser on your hard drive. When your Web site 
is dynamic, previewing your pages isn’t that simple, because you need a 
Web server to serve the page to a browser. You may also need database soft-
ware, application software, and other programs (such as WordPress, if your 
dynamic site is a blog).
Here’s a closer look at these components:
 
✓ Web server: This term commonly refers to two things: (a) a piece of 
computer hardware on which a Web site is stored (usually a high-
powered computer) and (b) the software on that computer that enables 
it to work as a server. A Web server responds to requests from a Web 
browser by serving up Web pages based on those requests.

365
 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
 
 If you can run Dreamweaver CS5, you’re a step ahead: Your personal 
computer should be more than powerful enough to act as a Web server. 
The main reason most of us don’t use our own computers as Web serv-
ers is that we lack the high-end Internet connection you find at most 
commercial service providers.
 
✓ Data source: The best dynamic sites are created by connecting a data-
base to a Web site. Thus, in addition to a Web server, you may need to 
install a database program, such as MySQL or Microsoft Access. 
 
✓ Application server: You may also need to set up an application server, 
which helps the Web server process specially marked Web pages. When 
the browser requests one of these pages, the Web server hands off the 
page to the application server, which processes the page before sending 
it to the browser. 
Fortunately, you’re not the only one who has ever had to set up a computer 
to serve dynamic Web pages; some smart programmers have put together 
packages with all the software you need to mimic the functions of the kind of 
Web server that will host your site when it’s published online. (You find a list 
of software and server options in the next section.)
Installing Web servers and 
related software
Many different server programs are in use on the Web today. Big commercial 
service providers use sophisticated server programs to host Web sites for 
many clients on one computer — but a number of simple options work well 
on desktop computers. 
 
Until you set up a local Web server and set the proper permissions on your 
local computer, you won’t be able to create and test a dynamic site, regardless 
of whether you write the programming code yourself or use a CMS, such as 
WordPress or Joomla!.
Here’s a list of a few popular Web server packages you can install on Mac or 
Windows computers:
 
✓ MAMP stands for Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Essentially 
MAMP collects all the programs you need in one specially designed 
package. The idea is to simplify the setup of a local Web server and the 
related software you need for developing and testing a dynamic Web site 
with Dreamweaver on any computer running Mac OS X. (You can find 
MAMP at www.mamp.info.)

366
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
✓ MoWeS enables you to set up a WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and 
PHP) system on any Windows system. As with MAMP, this package 
makes it easier to set up and install all the software you need to develop 
a dynamic site — in this case, on a Windows computer. (To learn more, 
visit www.mowes.chsoftware.net.)
 
✓ Easy PHP gives you everything you need in one nifty package. This pre-
configured collection of tools includes an Apache Web server, MySQL 
database, and PHP. (Download it for free from www.easyphp.org.)
 
✓ Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), formerly called Internet 
Information Server, is a set of software tools that also works well for 
testing dynamic Web pages on a Windows computer and serves as both 
a Web server and an application server. If you’re running an edition of 
Windows 7, Vista, or Windows XP that supports IIS, all you have to do is 
make sure you’ve enabled IIS — and that you’ve set up the necessary per-
missions to use it on your computer. (Learn more at www.microsoft.
com/iis.)
 
If you’re creating a custom dynamic site, after you set up the server software 
and related software listed in this section, you’re ready to go. However, if 
you’re using a blogging tool or other CMS (such as WordPress or Joomla!), you 
must also install those programs and set up the blog on your local computer 
in exactly the way you intend to set it up on your Web server.
Exploring Database and Related Panels
In Dreamweaver, the most fundamental elements of creating a dynamic Web 
site are in the Application panel, which includes the Databases, Bindings, 
Components, and Server Behaviors panels. In this section, I introduce you to 
these panels and how they work together to help you create a dynamic site.
The Databases panel
The Databases panel lets you look at the databases on your application 
server. In the Databases panel, you can view your entire database structure 
within Dreamweaver — tables, fields, views, and stored procedures — with-
out needing to use separate database software.
 
You can find the Databases panel by choosing Window➪Databases.
In Figure 13-3, you see a connection established to the Contacts database. 
You can view all the fields in that database by clicking the plus (+) sign next 
to Contacts.

367
 Chapter 13: Creating Dynamic Web Sites
 
Figure 13-3:

and Server

panels.
 
The Bindings panel
The Bindings panel enables you to add and remove dynamic-content data 
sources from your document. The number and kinds of available data 
sources can vary, depending on whether you use ASP.NET, PHP, JSP, or some 
other server technology. A data source — essentially wherever you get the 
information to use on your dynamic Web page — can be a recordset from a 
database — that is, a file used to hold a collection of data. After you create a 
recordset, the data can be displayed on a Web page.
 
If you don’t see the Bindings panel, you can open it by choosing Window➪
Bindings.
With the Bindings panel, you can access data sources in several ways. You 
can find out what data-source objects you have available by clicking the plus 
sign (+) in the Bindings panel to display the Add Bindings pop-up menu.
The Server Behaviors panel
Server behaviors are server-side scripts that perform some type of action. 
Through the Server Behaviors panel, you can add server-side scripts (such 
as those for user authentication and record navigation) to your pages. Server 
behaviors available to you vary depending on the server technology you use.
 
You can get to the Server Behaviors panel by choosing Window➪Server 
Behaviors.
You can view the available server behaviors by clicking the plus sign (+) in 
the Server Behaviors panel to get the Server Behaviors pop-up menu.

368
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
The Components panel
Components are reusable bits of code that you can create and insert 
directly into your pages. To open the Components panel, choose Window➪
Components. In Dreamweaver, you can create components for JSP, 
ColdFusion, and ASP.NET pages to use (in Web-server-speak, consume) Web 
services, display information, or accommodate just about any other use you 
can imagine.

In This Chapter
▶ Appreciating the power of InContext Editing
▶ Creating templates for InContext sites
▶ Accessing InContext online features
▶ Updating a Web site through a browser
▶ Cool new things you can do with Business Catalyst
I
f you design Web sites for clients — or you’re creating a site that you want 
others to be able to update (without their having to learn Dreamweaver) — 
you’re sure to love the features covered in this chapter. Adobe now offers two 
online services — InContext Editing and Business Catalyst — that can greatly 
improve your ability to serve clients and other contributors to a Web site by 
enabling others to update a Web site created in Dreamweaver more easily 
than ever before.
 
✓ InContext Editing is a Web-based tool that enables anyone with pass-
word access to your server to make updates to a Dreamweaver Web site 
through a Web browser. That means the people making the updates (your 
clients, colleagues, club members, and so on) don’t have to buy or install 
any new software (not even Dreamweaver). They can simply use any one 
of the most popular Web browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari.
 
✓ Business Catalyst is the newest of Dreamweaver’s online tools, and is 
available for the first time as an integrated feature in Dreamweaver CS5. 
Adobe acquired Business Catalyst and is using it to add an extensive 
array of online services — including an e-commerce shopping cart, bulk-
mail features, analytics, and more.
Most of this chapter covers how to design sites for InContext Editing (abbre-
viated as ICE). First you discover how to set up a site to work with InContext 
Editing. Then I show how incredibly easy it is for your clients, coworkers, 
friends, your Aunt Maude, or anyone else you know to edit a site after you set 
it up with ICE. 

370
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
At the end of this chapter, you find an introduction to the features in 
Business Catalyst. Although Business Catalyst greatly extends the function-
ality of Dreamweaver, it is a completely new set of tools. As with InContext 
Editing, Business Catalyst uses a Web interface that enables you to admin-
ister its features through a Web browser. Unlike ICE, however, Business 
Catalyst includes so many new features of its own that it’s way beyond the 
scope of this Dreamweaver book. (You’ll find great help files and tutorials on 
the Business Catalyst site.) To help you appreciate how you can use Business 
Catalyst and what it’s capable of, I include an overview of the features of this 
new tool set at the end of this chapter.
Understanding InContext Editing
The beauty of Adobe’s InContext Editing is that you (or someone else) can 
easily update any site created with Dreamweaver as easily as you might 
update a site created with a blog program (such as WordPress). 
To use InContext Editing, you create and design a page in Dreamweaver just 
as you would design any other page — and then you add a little special code 
to indicate which areas of the page may be edited using the online InContext 
tools. The process is quite similar to the process of creating Dreamweaver 
templates (covered in Chapter 7). You can even use InContext in combina-
tion with Dreamweaver’s templates, but you have to add more code for the 
InContext features, covered in the sections that follow.
 
You cannot use InContext Editing with sites that use advanced program-
ming options such as ASP.NET, PHP, or ColdFusion. Indeed, the advantage of 
InContext is that you don’t have to use advanced programming languages such 
as PHP. Although those advanced capabilities make WordPress easy if you 
want to create a blog post, they also make it really hard to use if you want to 
edit the design of the blog. Similarly, many Web developers have spent enor-
mous amounts of time using very complex programming, such as PHP or ASP.
NET, to create administrative tools in Dreamweaver that their clients can use 
to update a site easily. (You learn more about how blogs work and the fea-
tures in Dreamweaver you can use with programming languages, such as PHP, 
in Chapter 13.)
There are two ways to create pages in Dreamweaver that work with InConext 
Editing:
 
✓ A single page with ICE features: In the first exercise that follows, you 
start by creating a single HTML page using any one of the CSS layouts 
included in Dreamweaver, and then select the InContext option as you 
create the page. With this option, the InContext editing region is added 
to the page automatically, but the page will not work as a Dreamweaver 
template.

371
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
✓ A Dreamweaver template with ICE features: The second exercise that 
follows includes instructions for creating a Dreamweaver template and 
then adding ICE code. These same instructions work well if you want to 
alter any site that already uses Dreamweaver templates to support the 
InContext Editing features, including sites created with Dreamweaver 
CS3 or CS4.
 
You can learn more about InContext Editing at www.adobe.com/products/
incontextediting, shown in Figure 14-1. To update a Web site created 
using Dreamweaver’s ICE features, you can log in at http://
incontextediting.adobe.com.

Creating new ICE pages using 
Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts
To create a new page using one of Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts, make sure 
you’ve completed the site setup process (covered at the beginning of 
Chapter 2), and then follow these instructions:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears (see Figure 14-2).
 
2. Choose Blank Page from the left column and HTML from the Page 
Type column in the middle.
 
 You must choose Blank Page (not Blank Template) from the left column 
to use the automated InContext features in version CS5. 

372
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
 
You cannot use InContext Editing with sites that use advanced program-
ming options, such as ASP.NET, PHP, or ColdFusion.
 
3. Select any of the CSS layouts listed in the Layout section.
 
 For this example, I chose 1 Column Fixed, Centered, Header and Footer.
 
Figure 14-2: 
When you 
select the 
name of a 
CSS layout 
in the New 
Document 
dialog box, 
a preview is 
displayed in 
the top-right 
corner.
 
 
4. From the Layout CSS drop-down list at the bottom right of the New 
Document window, choose the type of style sheet you want to create 
as you create the page.
 
• Add to Head creates an internal style sheet and includes all the 
styles for the layout in the Head area of the new document.
 
• Create New File creates a new external style sheet with all the 
page styles as you create the new document with the design.
 
• Link to Existing File adds the style sheet information for the new 
document to an existing external style sheet.
 
 You can always change how the style sheet is set up later on, by moving 
styles from an internal style sheet to an external one or from one exter-
nal style sheet to another. (See Chapter 5 for details.)
 
5. Click to select the Enable InContext Editing check box at the bottom 
right of the New Document window.
 
 The feature activates Adobe’s automated InContext Editing features, 
which inserts a line of code at the top of the page and makes the main 
area of the selected CSS Layout an editable region with the additional 
code needed for InContext Editing.
 
6. Click Create.
 
 The new page is created and opened in the main workspace.

373
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
 If you chose Create New File from the Layout CSS drop-down list, a 
dialog box prompts you to save the style sheet separately. If the styles 
are contained in an internal style sheet or you chose to add them to an 
existing style sheet, they’re created automatically as the page is created.
 
7. Choose File➪Save to save the page and styles.
 
 The Save As dialog box opens.
 
 It’s good practice to save any Web page when you first create it, but this 
is especially true when creating InContext pages. 
 
8. Enter a name for the page and click Save.
 
 The page is saved and the Copy Dependent Files dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 14-3.
 
 Be sure to save all the pages of a Web site, including external style 
sheets and any dependent files, in your local site folder. You find 
more about defining a Web site and specifying a local site folder in 
Dreamweaver in Chapter 2.

Dream-
weaver

files auto-
matically. 
These files 
must be 
uploaded to 
your Web 
server. 
 
9. In the Copy Dependent Files dialog box (see Figure 14-3), click OK to 
save the ICE files.
 
 Dreamweaver creates a folder called includes with a subfolder called 
ice, — and saves these files into the subfolder in your local site folder 
automatically. For the ICE features to work, you must upload the 
includes folder, as well as the ice subfolder and files, to your Web 
server when you publish your site.

374

10. Click to select the blue Editable Region tab at the top of the main con-
tent area, and in the Property inspector, specify the options you want, 
as shown in the bottom of Figure 14-4.
 
 Use the InContext Editing options available in the Property inspector 
to limit what someone can change in the page using the online tools. 
You can check or uncheck each of the options to control whether each 
feature is available when someone edits the page using a Web browser. 
For example, you could enable someone editing the page using the 
online InContext Editing tools to change whether text is bold or italic, 
but not enable changes to the font color. Or you could enable someone 
to change the text on the page, but not the formatting by clicking the 
Uncheck All button, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
 See Table 14-1 for an explanation of each option for InContext Editable 
regions.
 
Figure 14-4: 
You can 
specify 
which 
formatting 
options, 
such as font 
face or font 
size, can be 
changed 
within an 
InContext 
editable 
region. 
 
11. Design the page as you would design any other Web page using 
Dreamweaver’s many features to add images, format text, define 
styles, and so on.
 
12. To add more editable regions, click to select any tag, such as an 
image, unordered list, or <div> tag and choose Insert➪InContext 
Editing➪Editable Region.
 
• If you select any element within an existing ICE editable region, 
Dreamweaver gives you a warning message that you cannot create 
editable regions within other editable regions.
 
• If you selected a <div> tag that was not already contained within an 
editable region, it’s turned into an editable region automatically — 
and no dialog box opens.

375
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
• If you selected an tag, such as an <h1> tag or unordered list 
(<ul>) tag, the Create Editable Region dialog box opens (see 
Figure 14-5). You have two choices: add a <div> tag around the 
selected element, or transform the parent (meaning the <div> tag 
that surrounds the selected element). 
 
 When you choose Transform the Parent Tag into an Editable 
Region, Dreamweaver selects the most immediate <div> tag that 
surrounds the selected element and makes everything in that 
<div> tag editable by adding the necessary code to make it an ICE 
editable region. 
 
 When you choose Wrap Current Selection with a DIV Tag and Then 
Transform It, only the item you selected becomes editable. In the 
example shown in Figure 14-5, I’m making only the heading in the 
<h1> tag that I selected an editable region by choosing to wrap it.

Editable 
Region dia-

13. When the page is complete, use Dreamweaver built-in publishing 
features to upload the page to your Web server. (You find detailed 
instructions in Chapter 4.)
 
 Before you can use the InContext Editing features, you must upload the 
page to a Web server and set up the site at 
http://incontextediting.adobe.com/
 
 You find detailed instructions in the sections “Setting up an InContext 
site online” and “Editing an InContext page with a Web browser,” later in 
this chapter.

 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
Creating repeating regions with ICE
The advantage of a repeating region is that you can enable people who are 
editing the site online through the InContext Web site to create multiple col-
lections of elements all at once. For example, you could create an editable 
region with formatted areas for the name and biography of an employee. If 
you want to list only one employee on the page, creating a single editable 
region (as you did in the previous exercise) is fine. If, however, you want to 
be able to add more employee names and bios to the page, creating a repeat-
ing region would enable a user to copy the entire section each additional 
employee.
Follow these steps to add a repeating editable region to a page that uses 
InContext Editing:
 
1. Create a new page or open an existing page. Then click to insert your 
cursor anywhere you want to add an InContext repeating editable 
region.
 
2. On the page, click to select any HTML block tag (such as a head-
ing tag, unordered list, or <div> tag) that you want to turn into an 
InContext editable region.
 
 Although <div> tags themselves are ideal as InContext editable regions, 
Dreamweaver will add a <div> tag around whatever you select.
 
 In Figure 14-6, you see the tag selector at the bottom of the workspace, 
an ideal way to select a tag before using the InContext Insert panel to 
turn it into an editable region.
 
3. Choose InContext Editing from the Insert panel drop-down menu to 
open the options for editable regions (see Figure 14-6).
 
 Alternatively you can choose Insert➪InContext Editing and then select 
Repeating Editable Region from the fly-out menu.
 
4. Click Create Repeating Region, as shown in Figure 14-6.
 
 The options available to you when you create a repeating region are the 
same as those available when you add an editable region. (See Step 12 in 
the preceding section for details.)
 
5. Choose File➪Save to save the page.
 
 If you haven’t already added InContext features to the site, Dreamweaver 
opens the Copy Dependent Files dialog box (shown in Figure 14-3 ear-
lier in the chapter). Click OK and Dreamweaver automatically creates a 
folder called includes with a subfolder called ice — and saves these 
files into the subfolder in your local site folder. For the ICE features to 
work, you must upload the includes folder, as well as the ice sub-
folder and files, to your Web server when you publish your site.

6. When the page is complete, use the Dreamweaver built-in publishing 
features to upload the page to your Web server. (You find detailed 
instructions in Chapter 4.)
 
 Before you can use the InContext Editing features, you must 
upload the page to a Web server and set up the site at http://
incontextediting.adobe.com/. You find detailed instructions 
in the sections “Setting up an InContext site online” and “Editing an 
InContext page with a Web browser,” later in this chapter.
Using CSS with ICE
You can combine the power of CSS with InContext Editing, but you can make 
only class and tag styles available to anyone who has access through ICE.
To make styles work with ICE, follow these steps:
 
1. Define the styles as class styles, as you do in the section that follows. 
 
2. Make the style sheet available by choosing Insert➪InContext Editing➪
Manage Available CSS Classes.

379
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
3. In the Manage Available CSS Classes dialog box that appears, click 
the check box next to any external style sheets that you want to make 
available when someone edits the page using InContext Editor.
Combining Dreamweaver templates 
with ICE features
For the best of both worlds, combine InContext Editing and Dreamweaver’s 
templates. ICE is great because it enables anyone with password access to 
edit a site online with a Web browser — but Dreamweaver’s templates also 
offer valuable features. One such capability is creating new pages within 
Dreamweaver based on the template, and the option to update many pages at 
once by editing the locked regions of a template — a big timesaver.
In Chapter 7, you find detailed instructions for creating and working with 
Dreamweaver templates. In this section, you find instructions for combining 
InContext Editing with Dreamweaver’s templates.
 
You can convert a page you created using the automated InContext Editing 
features (covered in the previous exercise) into a Dreamweaver template. 
However, I strongly recommend that you do it the other way around: Adding 
InContext Editing regions to a Dreamweaver template is easy; if you start by 
creating a simple HTML page with InContext Editing, turning it into a fully 
functional Dreamweaver template requires adding code manually to the head 
region of page (which gets complicated quickly).
To create a Dreamweaver template with editable regions and make the site 
editable with InContext Editing, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens.
 
2. In the list on the left, click the Blank Template option.
 
3. In the Template Type list, choose HTML Template.
 
 You can only use InContext Editing with HTML Templates. InContext 
Editing does not work on pages that use advanced programming 
options, such as ASP.NET, PHP, or ColdFusion.
 
4. In the Layout area, choose <none> to create a blank page or select any 
of the predesigned CSS layouts.
 
 Unlike the previous exercise (where you used one of Dreamweaver’s CSS 
layouts), if you create a Dreamweaver template and then add ICE fea-
tures, using a CSS layout is optional. (You find instructions for custom-
izing Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts, as well as for creating a new layout in 
a blank page, in Chapter 6.)

380
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 A new blank template is created and opens in the main work area; the 
New Document dialog box closes.
 
6. Choose File➪Save.
 
 If you haven’t disabled the dialog box, a warning appears, stating that 
the template doesn’t have any editable regions and asking whether you 
really want to save it. Click Yes to continue. (You find instructions for 
creating editable regions in the template in Step 10.)
 
7. Click OK to save the page.
 
 The Save window appears with the Templates folder open. You must 
save all your Dreamweaver templates in the Templates folder. (If you 
don’t already have a folder named Templates in your local site folder, 
Dreamweaver creates one for you when you create your first template.)
 
8. Give the template a name and click Save. 
 
 The template is saved automatically with a .dwt extension, which desig-
nates the file as a Dreamweaver template.
 
9. Add images, text, and other elements as you would in any other 
Dreamweaver file.
 
 You find instructions for designing Web pages throughout this book. 
 
 
You create a Dreamweaver page design in a template, just as you would 
in any other Web page.
 
10. To create an editable region in a Dreamweaver template:
 
a. Select an image or content area defined by a <div> tag.
 
 A handy way to select a section surrounded by a <div> tag is to 
place your cursor anywhere in that area of the page, and then 
use the tag selector at the bottom of the workspace to select the 
<div>, as shown at the bottom of Figure 14-6 earlier in this 
chapter.
 
b. Choose Insert➪New Template Object➪New Editable Region.
 
 The New Editable Region dialog box opens.
 
c. Give the new editable region a name.
 
 I recommend something that identifies the type of content it is, 
such as mainContent.
 
 The region you define as editable becomes an area that can be 
changed in any page created from the template. You can have mul-
tiple editable regions in one template, and you have the option to 
make any or all of those regions editable with InContext.

381
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
d. Click OK.
 
 The editable region is enclosed in a light blue box with a light blue 
tab at the top left of the box, identified by the name you entered 
into the New Editable Region dialog box.
 
 To create additional editable regions, repeat Steps a–d.
 
11. When you finish designing the page and add all the editable regions 
you want, choose File➪Save to save your template.
 
 When you save a new template page (or you save an existing page as 
a template), Dreamweaver adds the .dwt extension automatically and 
saves the file into a Templates folder. 
 
12. To add the capability to use InContext Editing on any of the editable 
regions in the template, first click to select the editable region.
 
 The best way to make sure you’ve selected the editable region is to 
place your cursor anywhere on the page that’s part of the region you 
want to make editable, and then click the <div> tag in the Quick Tag 
Selector, as shown in Figure 14-7.
 
 When you create an editable region in a Dreamweaver template, 
Dreamweaver adds special code to identify it as an editable area of the 
template. When you use the InContext features to make a region edit-
able, Dreamweaver adds additional code to the template. It’s important 
to make sure that the ICE code is outside the Dreamweaver template 
code, which means the ICE code can be edited only in the template 
itself, not in any page created from the template. Doing so ensures 
that you don’t accidentally delete the code in a page created from the 
template — and that if you do modify the ICE code later, those changes 
are updated in all pages created from the template. (For more on how to 
edit Dreamweaver templates, see Chapter 7.)

Selector to

13. To make the selected editable region editable using InContext Editing, 
choose Insert➪InContext Editing➪Create Editable Region.
 
 The Create Editable Region dialog box opens.
 
14. In the Create Editable Region dialog box, click to select the radio 
button next to Wrap the Entire Template Editable Region with a DIV 
Tag and Then Transform It, and then click OK.
 
 Dreamweaver inserts a <div> tag around the selected content — and 
the editable region tag — automatically, as shown in Figure 14-8.
 
Figure 14-8:

for both

regions in

as well as 
the code 
that creates

InContext 
Editing. 
 
15. Choose File➪Save to save the template.
 
 If you haven’t already added InContext features to the site, Dreamweaver 
opens the Copy Dependent Files dialog box (refer to Figure 14-3). Click 
OK and Dreamweaver automatically creates a folder called includes 
with a subfolder called ice — and saves these files into the subfolder 
in your local site folder. For the ICE features to work, you must upload 
the includes folder, as well as the ice subfolder and files, to your Web 
server when you publish your site.
 
16. After the template is complete, you can create new pages from the 
template in Dreamweaver, and use the template to make updates 
to all the pages from the template, just as you would with any other 
Dreamweaver template.
 
 You find instructions for both tasks in Chapter 7.

383
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
17. When the page is complete, use Dreamweaver built-in publishing fea-
tures to upload the page to your Web server. 
 
 You find detailed instructions in Chapter 4.
 
 Before you can use the InContext Editing features, you must 
upload the page to a Web server and set up the site at http://
incontextediting.adobe.com/. You find detailed instructions 
in the sections “Setting up an InContext site online” and “Editing an 
InContext page with a Web browser,” later in this chapter.
Adding ICE to an existing 
template-based site
If you’re like many Web designers, you may already have Web sites that use 
Dreamweaver templates and want to add InContext Editing to manage the 
sites and simplify contributors’ access to pages on the site.
You can add InContext Editing features to an existing site by using much the 
same approach covered in the previous section — but when you’re working 
on an existing site, keep in mind the following:
 
✓ When you add an InContext editable region to a page that already 
includes Dreamweaver template editable regions, make sure that the 
ICE code is outside the Dreamweaver template code. This prevents the 
ICE code from being edited or deleted in any page created from the tem-
plate. (For more on how to edit Dreamweaver templates, see Chapter 7.)
 
✓ When you add an editable region using InContext Editing, Dreamweaver 
adds a <div> tag with the ICE code around whatever you’ve selected. 
Don’t give the InContext <div> tag any additional formatting or CSS styles. 
(Note that this additional <div> tag won’t change the layout of the 
page.)
Setting up an InContext site online
To set up a site so its pages can be edited using Adobe’s InContext Editing 
online tools, you must first set up the site at http://incontextediting.
adobe.com/, as shown in Figure 14-9. You need take this step only once 
per Web site to activate the online features; you can create as many user 
accounts as you like for each site so multiple people can edit the site after it’s 
set up.

To set up a site and create a new user account for your InContext Editing site, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Web site http://incontextediting.adobe.com/ (see in 
Figure 14-9), in a recent version of the Firefox, Internet Explorer, or 
Safari Web browser.
 
2. Fill out the form that opens.
 
 Be sure to enter a name, a valid e-mail address (that has not already 
been used to create an InContext account), and a password that is at 
least six characters long.
 
 
The account you create here becomes a master account login that can 
manage multiple sites and different users.
 
3. Click the Create New Account button.
 
4. Verify the e-mail address you entered.
 
 When you create a new account, Adobe sends a verification e-mail from 
incontextediting-admin@adobe.com. You must click the link in 
that e-mail to verify the address before you can use the new account to 
log in.

InContext, they’re listed on this page; if you’re new to InContext, the 
page is blank.
 
7. Click the Add Site button at the top of the Manage Sites Page.
 
 The Add Site window opens, as shown in Figure 14-10.
 
Figure 14-10:

8. Enter the name and URL of the site and click Next.
 
 The FTP Settings window opens.
  
9. Enter the FTP access information you use to connect to your Web 
server and then click the Test button to confirm it works. After you’ve 
successfully established a connection, click Next.
 
 The Assets window opens.
 
 If you use a secure server, choose SFTP from the drop-down menu at the 
top of the window. Your FTP Access information is specific to your Web 
server; you need to get this information from your service provider if 
you don’t have it. Note: This is the same information you enter into the 
Server dialog box in Dreamweaver’s site-publishing features (covered in 
Chapter 4).

10. Fill in the fields in the Assets window and click Save.
 
 For most Web servers, the first two fields in the Assets window are optional, 
but InContext Editing works better if you type in the name of the main folder 
on your server (the one that corresponds to the local site folder on your hard 
drive). If you get an error message that InContext can’t write to your server, 
you may have to enter the folder name on your server. You can leave the 
Media Folder field blank — or enter the location of your images folder (or 
any other media folder you want to specify). Whatever folder you enter here 
opens automatically if a user tries to add an image or other media file using 
the InContext Editing tools covered in the next section.
 
 The third field in the Assets window lists all the common names for the 
main page of a Web site. You can delete all the names in this field except 
the one that represents name of the main page of your site. Many Web 
servers are set up for index.html as the main page, but if you use a 
Windows server, the page may be default.htm.
 
11. In the final setup window, labeled Done, click Invite User to add a 
new user who can edit the site, as shown in Figure 14-11.
 
 The Invite User window opens.
 
 If you don’t want anyone else to edit the site, or you’re eager to test it out 
before you set up any new users, click Edit. You can always add more 
users later by clicking the Invite User button one the Manage Sites page.

12. In the Invite User window, enter a name and e-mail address and then 
choose Editor or Publisher from the Privileges drop-down list. Click 
Invite.
 
 An e-mail is sent to the new user and the Manage Users window opens.
 
 Choose Editor if you want to limit how the user can edit the site by 
applying the restrictions you specified when you set up the ICE options 
in Dreamweaver.

387
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
 Choose Publisher if you want the user to have additional editing options.
 
 If you want to see the e-mail that is sent to you user, select the check 
box next to Send Me a Copy of the E-Mail.
Managing ICE sites
After you set up one or more sites with InContext Editing online, you may 
need to manage settings, invite more users, and so on. This section explains 
a few of the key ways you can manage your sites.
To access the Manage Users window, shown in Figure 14-12, log into your 
InContext Editing account, and click the name of the site you want to edit. In 
the window, you have several options:
 
✓ Click Invite User to add more users.
 
✓ Click the name of any user to edit their profile.
 
✓ Click the View/Edit Site button to open the site in a new browser window 
where you can edit the pages using the InContext Editor (see the follow-
ing section for details).
 
✓ Click the Configure Site tab (just to the right of Manage Users) to edit 
the FTP access and other settings for the site. You have to re-enter your 
main account password to access this page.
 
✓ Click the Manage Sites link at the very top of the page to return to the 
main InContext Editing page (as shown in Figure 14-13), where you can 
access all the sites you’ve set up through your master account.

You open the Manage Sites window, shown in Figure 14-13, by clicking the 
Manage Sites link at the top of any screen after you log into InContext Editing. 

388
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
Here you can manage all the sites you have set up in InContext Editing. One 
advantage of InContext Editing is that you can use it to manage many sites. 
Thus you can easily access multiple sites, while limiting the access of the 
users you set up to only the site you want them to edit.
From the Manage Sites page, you have several options:
 
✓ Use the drop-down list next to the site name to make the site Active or 
Inactive. When you make a site Inactive, you disable any user accounts 
you have created for that site.
 
✓ Click the URL of the site to open the site in the InContext Editor where 
you can make changes through your Web browser, as you discover in 
the following section.
 
✓ Click the Manage Users and Setting button next to each site name to 
open the corresponding Manage Users window (refer to Figure 14-12).

Editing an InContext page 
with a Web browser
Setting up a site to use InContext Editing has a few complexities (as described 
in the previous sections in this chapter) — but using InContext Editing to 
make changes to a Web site is remarkably easy. That said, those of us who 
have worked with clients (or have had to teach complete novices how to do 
even simple things on a computer) know that easy is a relative term.
This final section is designed to help you help your clients — or anyone else 
you want to give access to a site using InContext Editing. If you’ve gotten this 
far in this book, using InContext Editing is probably easy enough that you 
could do without my help. So consider this section a way to get a quick over-
view of how InContext Editing works for your users — and a handy reference 
for yourself if you have to provide technical support by phone or e-mail to 
someone who is just getting started with Web design.

389
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
The first challenge — and potentially the biggest one — is that anyone you 
invite as a user must verify the invitation by clicking a link in an e-mail mes-
sage sent for that purpose — and then entering an Adobe ID. If the person 
you invited does not already have an Adobe ID, he or she will have to create 
one in order to log in and start editing the site. 
The following steps walk you through the process of editing an InContext 
site, starting with the e-mail invitation sent to a new user. It’s a great exercise 
to send yourself an invitation and go through the process once so you know 
how it works. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Open your e-mail program and look for a message with the subject 
line: Invitation to use Adobe InContext Editing.
 
 This message contains several links.
 
2. To visit the site and activate the account, click the link that appears 
just after the following text: 
To view and accept the invitation, click the link 
below or copy and paste the following URL into 
your browser.
 
 The Web site in the invitation opens in the browser, and the Adobe 
InContext Editing Invitation pop-up window opens on top of it (as shown 
in Figure 14-14).
 
Figure 14-14: 
Every new 
user must 
verify an 
InContext 
Account by 
entering an 
Adobe ID. 
Users who 
have no 
Adobe ID 
must create 
one before 
accessing 
a site using 
InContext.
 

390
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
3. Enter your Adobe ID user name and password and click Sign In.
 
 Many people don’t even realize they already have an Adobe account. 
If you’ve ever downloaded software or anything else that required an 
account at Adobe.com, you can use the same Adobe ID you created at 
that time to activate your new InContext Editing account. If you think 
you have an account but don’t remember your login information, you 
can retrieve your password: Click the Forgot password? link just under 
the Sign In button and follow the steps it provides. After you’ve reset 
the password, you can return to the login page and log in to InContext 
Editing.
 
 
Every Adobe ID account requires a unique e-mail address — so if you’ve 
created an Adobe ID in the past and try to do so again with the same 
e-mail address, you’re informed that the e-mail address you typed in is 
already in use. You can create multiple Adobe IDs with different e-mail 
addresses, but Adobe prefers that you use the same ID.
 
4. After you log in, click the big green Edit Page button at the top-right of 
the browser window, as shown in Figure 14-15, to open the page in the 
InContext Editor.
 
Figure 14-15: 
Click the 
Edit Page 
button to 
open the 
InContext 
Editing 
tools.
 
 
5. Navigate around the site in the browser until you get to a page you 
want to edit.
 
 You can click any link on any page, just as you would if you were simply 
viewing the site in a Web browser.
 
6. Click the Edit Page button to open the InContext Editing Tools.

391
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
 
7. Click to place your cursor in an editable area of the page, and then 
use the editing options across the top of the browser window (as 
shown in Figure 14-16).
 
 Across the top of the screen, you find common editing options — 
such as font face and font size — unless they’ve been turned off in 
Dreamweaver (as described in the earlier sections in this chapter.)
 
 Use the Advanced drop-down list at the far-right top of the page to 
access heading styles, font color, and highlight options.
 
 
You can edit only those areas of a page that are set up as InContext edit-
able regions (as described in earlier in this chapter). If you are working 
with a client or other contributor, you may have to explain which areas 
of the page can be edited and which cannot. For example, in the site 
shown in Figure 14-16, I’ve set up the three photos in the main area of 
the page, and the text below each one, in editable regions. However, the 
links and banner at the top of the page are not editable and can only be 
changed in Dreamweaver. 
 
Figure 14-16: 
Once you’re 
logged 
in, you 
can make 
changes 
to any text, 
images, 
or other 
content on 
the page in 
an editable 
region.
 
 
8. Click the Save Draft button in the bottom-right corner of the browser 
window to save your changes without changing the page on the public 
Web site.
 
 The InContext Editing tool saves a copy of the page on the Adobe server 
where you are editing it. 
 
 
Saving your page regularly is good practice because otherwise, if your 
Internet connection is interrupted for any reason, you can lose your 
work.

392
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
9. Click the Done button in the bottom-right corner of the browser 
window to save your changes and close the editing tools.
 
 The editing features are closed, and you can use the navigation buttons 
or type in any URL to move to another page. Again, with this option, the 
InContext Editing tool saves a copy of the page on the Adobe server but 
does not publish it to the Web site. 
 
10. Click the Publish Draft button in the bottom-right corner of the 
browser window to apply the changes to the live Web site. Click 
Discard Draft to delete it.
 
 
Remember, when you click Publish Draft your changes are immediately 
applied to the live Web site.
 
If you make changes to a Web site in Dreamweaver while someone is 
viewing the site in InContext, and then upload the page to a server using 
Dreamweaver’s FTP options, the changes aren’t immediately visible in 
the InContext Editor, even if you use the Refesh/Reload button in the Web 
browser. Although Refresh/Reload works well when you’re just testing a site 
in a browser, this feature doesn’t work with InContext. Instead, you have 
to log out, clear the browser’s cache, and log back in to see the changes. 
(Alternatively, you can switch to another Web browser and log in fresh to see 
the changes made in Dreamweaver in the InContext Editor right away.)
Returning to an InContext site
After you set up an active account, you don’t have to use the link in the 
verification e-mail if you want to access the site and edit it using InContext. 
Instead, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the site’s URL in Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari. 
 
2. Press Ctrl+E (Windows) or Ô+E (on a Mac) to open a sign in window 
and display the InContext Editing tools.
 
3. After you’re logged in, you can navigate around the site in the 
browser by clicking any link on any page, just as you would if you 
were simply viewing the site in a browser.
 
4. When you reach a page you want to edit, click the Edit Page button to 
open the InContext Editing Tools.
 
5. Choose Save Draft to save your work without publishing it, choose 
Done (to save a draft and close the tools), choose Publish Draft to save 
your changes and publish them to the Web site.

393
 Chapter 14: Managing Web Sites with Adobe InContext and Business Catalyst
Appreciating Business Catalyst
The newest of Dreamweaver’s online tools, Business Catalyst, is available for 
the first time as an integrated feature in Dreamweaver CS5 and its features 
are being added to InContext Editing so that you can combine the power of 
both tools. Adobe acquired Business Catalyst and is using it to add an exten-
sive array of online services to the set of options built into Dreamweaver.
Although Business Catalyst greatly extends the functionality of Dreamweaver 
and works in conjunction with InContext Editing, Business Catalyst is a com-
pletely new set of tools. As does ICE, Business Catalyst uses a Web interface 
that enables you to administer its features through a Web browser. Unlike 
ICE, however, Business Catalyst includes so many new features of its own 
that it’s way beyond the scope of this book.
You can find great help files and tutorials on the Business Catalyst site 
(http://businesscatalyst.com/). To help you appreciate how you can 
use Business Catalyst and its capabilities, the following is an overview of the 
features included in this new toolset:
 
✓ Content Management System: With Business Catalyst, you can enable 
users to edit your Web site through a browser, using the SiteWalk 
Editing features.
 
✓ E-commerce: Business Catalyst includes a sophisticated e-commerce 
shopping cart that can be integrated with most popular payment gate-
ways, including PayPal and Google Checkout. Keep in mind, however, 
that setting up a payment gateway requires advanced skills on a Web 
server. To use such a service securely, you need to purchase an SSL 
Certificate — and may have to pay additional fees to your hosting ser-
vice for a static IP address and other technical requirements for a secure 
server.
 
✓ Integrated database: Use the integrated database to manage customer 
orders, bulk e-mail messages, and more.
 
✓ Web apps and module manager: Use the integrated Web Apps to 
make content searchable, create reusable content snippets, and add 
functionality.
 
✓ Community management: Enable any visitor to your site to comment on 
any content, including product listings.
 
✓ Built-in SEO support: Use the integrated features to help ensure that 
your site follows search-engine optimization guidelines and scores high 
in search-engine results.
 
✓ RSS feeds: Use the integrated RSS feed features to set up blog-like RSS 
feeds or create as many RSS channels as you want so your site can share 
content with other Web sites or bloggers.

394
Part III: Making It Cool with Advanced Features 
 
✓ Secure members-only area: Create user logins, easily e-mail access 
information, and set up user accounts with expiration dates and varying 
levels of access.
 
✓ Web-site reporting and analytics: Similar to the features in the popular 
Google Analytics software, but these analytics don’t require a separate 
login or set up with another company.
 
✓ Community forums: Create and moderate user forums, manage user 
access, and manage discussions using threads and posts.
 
✓ Blog features: Set up an integrated blog to go with your Web site.
 
✓ Photo galleries: Easily create and add photo galleries to your site.
 
✓ Ad rotators: Set up ad spaces on your site that rotate advertisers’ mes-
sages, as well as manage impressions and reporting.
 
✓ Metadata: Built in metadata framework makes it easier to create a 
sophisticated search features on your site and fill in the metadata fields 
recommended for search engines.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens features a collection of timesaving 
tips and great online resources. In Chapter 15, you 
find a collection of Web sites that can help you with some 
of the things you won’t find in Dreamweaver, such as 
domain registration. You also discover how to add 
detailed traffic tracking and e-commerce features and how 
to design and manage e-mail newsletters and other bulk 
e-mail messages. In Chapter 16, you find ten timesaving 
tips to help you get the most out of Dreamweaver. 

Chapter 15
Ten Resources You May Need
In This Chapter
▶ Finding domain registration services
▶ Protecting your e-mail address
▶ Highlighting your links with pop-ups
▶ Selling stuff on the Web and tracking your traffic
▶ Surveying your site visitors
▶ Creating templates and keeping up with Web standards
▶ Using Adobe.com and Favicon
A
lthough Dreamweaver is a wonderful tool for creating Web sites, it can’t 
handle everything you need to put a site online. For example, you can’t 
register a domain name using Dreamweaver, or create a Favicon, a special 
kind of image that appears in the top of a Web browser. I added this chapter 
to offer you a handy list of online resources that can help you finish your site 
when you need to go beyond the features in Dreamweaver.
 
Some of the online services featured in this chapter are now available in 
Dreamweaver if you use the new Business Catalyst covered in Chapter 14. 
This suite of tools, new in Dreamweaver CS5, includes online traffic reporting 
features, a shopping cart for e-commerce, and features that make it possible 
to manage an online contact list and send bulk e-mail efficiently. The online 
services featured in this chapter are also offered in Business Catalyst, are 
included this book to help you appreciate your options. Most of the services 
highlighted in this chapter, such as domain registration, are not included in 
any of Dreamweaver’s other features. 
Registering a Domain Name
The address for your Web site is its domain name. The domain name is what 
visitors need to know to find your Web site. For example, you can visit my 
Digital Family Web site at www.DigitalFamily.com.

398
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Even before you start building your Web site, I recommend that you register 
your own domain name. The process is simple, painless, and costs less than 
$10 per year, but it can take from a few hours to a few days for the domain 
registration process to be completed.
You can register any domain name that hasn’t already been taken by some-
one else, and for free, you can check to see whether a domain name is 
already taken. Just visit any domain registrar, such as www.godaddy.com or 
1and1.com, and enter the domain name you want into the search field on the 
main page of the registrar’s site. If the name you want is no longer available, 
most registration services will give you a list of recommended alternatives.
Most domain registration services also provide Web hosting services, but 
you don’t have to host your site at the same place where you register the 
name. You can set up a Web server anywhere you want and then use the 
domain management settings at your domain registration service to point 
your name to the server where your Web site is hosted.
 
When you enter a domain name into a Web browser, everything before the 
extension (the .com, .net, or .org part) can be written in uppercase or low-
ercase, and it will work just fine. However, if you want to go to a specific page 
within a Web site, such as www.DigitalFamily.com/videos, the text that 
comes after the extension is often case sensitive. Because the part before 
the .com doesn’t matter, I find it easier to recognize domain names when they’re 
written with capital letters. So, for example, I use www.DigitalFamily.com on 
my business cards instead of www.digitalfamily.com.
Protecting Your E-Mail Address 
from Spammers
Spammers gather millions of e-mail addresses from Web sites every day by 
collecting e-mail addresses from links on Web pages. Web designers often 
include an e-mail link so visitors can easily contact them. Unfortunately, 
those simple e-mail links enable spammers to easily gather e-mail addresses 
automatically.
To help counter this problem, the programmers at AddressMunger.com have 
come up with a special way of “hiding” e-mail addresses from the automated 
bots that spammers use. When you add this special code to your Web pages 
and use AddressMunger to create the e-mail links on your Web pages, your 
visitors can still e-mail you easily, but spammer’s can’t read your e-mail 
address. It’s an easy way to cut down on all that spam in your inbox.

399
 Chapter 15: Ten Resources You May Need
Highlighting Links with Pop-Ups
An innovative online service creates a small pop-up preview of any page you 
link to on your site, as you see in Figure 15-1. You simply sign up (for free) at 
Snap.com and use its online tool to generate special code, which you copy 
and paste into the code in your Web pages.
 
Figure 15-1: 
You can 
create links 
with pop-up 
previews 
with Snap.
com.
 
With Snap.com’s unique pop-ups, your visitors see a preview of the page 
or site that you’ve linked when they roll their cursors over a link. Adding this 
feature is a great way to give visitors a little more information as they peruse 
your pages and to highlight the links on your site.
Selling Stuff on the Web
You can sell things online in many ways. As a general rule, I recommend that 
you start simple and add more complex and expensive options after you 
know that you’ll make money with your site.
At the simple end of the spectrum, you can add a purchase button with the 
services offered at www.PayPal.com or checkout.google.com. Moving 
up in complexity and price, you can create a shopping system at 
smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce. If you want a more custom 
solution and the ability to create your own shopping cart, check out the 
powerful, highly customizable, Dreamweaver-compatible programs at www.
WebAssist.com or www.cartweaver.com.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Keeping Track of Traffic
Most Web hosting services provide basic log reports and traffic informa-
tion, but if you want to know for sure how people are finding your Web 
site and what they’re doing after they arrive, consider using a service like 
Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics), StatCounter.com, or 
WebSTAT.com.
To use any of these services, set up an account and copy a bit of code from 
the site into your Web pages. (The procedure is a simple copy-and-paste that 
you can do with code view in Dreamweaver.) Google Analytics, StatCounter 
and other services then use that bit of code to track your traffic.
 
Visit any of the services, such as Google Analytics, for a demo and a sample 
report that illustrates the kind of information you can collect, including 
what search terms someone used to find your site through a search engine. 
Studying how people use your Web site is one of the best ways to determine 
how to improve your site’s content and design.
 
For instructions on how to copy and paste code from a site like Google 
Analytics into the pages of your site in Dreamweaver, read the tuto-
rial on the very similar service, Google Adsense, on my Web site at www.
DigitalFamily.com/dreamweaver.
Taking Your Site’s Temperature 
with a Heat Map
Adding a heat map to your Web site is a great way to discover what people 
find most interesting on each page of your site. Analytics, covered in the pre-
vious section, measure overall traffic patterns on the different pages of your 
site; heat maps are designed to show you the popularity of the different ele-
ments on each page of your Web site.
When you add a heat map to your site, you get a visual snapshot showing 
the “hot areas” — the links, text, images, and other elements on a page that 
attract the most attention from your visitors. To learn more about how heat 
maps work, visit www.clickdensity.com or www.crazyegg.com. 
Surveying Your Visitors
Want to know what your visitors really think? Ask them. You can create a 
free, online survey at SurveyMonkey.com and link to it from your Web site. 
With SurveyMonkey, you create the survey using a Web browser. The site 

401
 Chapter 15: Ten Resources You May Need
then automatically tallies the results and presents them in a series of reports 
and pie charts. The survey results are a great way to impress your board of 
directors at the next annual meeting.
Keeping Up with Web Standards 
at W3.org
If you want to keep up with the latest developments in Web design and make 
sure you’re following standards, there’s no better place than W3.org, the offi-
cial Web site of the organization that sets Web standards. You can find loads 
of information on this nonprofit site, including the full specification for HTML, 
CSS, and much more. You can also test your Web pages for compliance with 
W3C standards by entering a page’s URL into the CSS validator at jigsaw.
w3.org/css-validator, or the MarkUp validator at validator.w3.org.
Extending Dreamweaver at Adobe.com
Visit the Dreamweaver Exchange Site at www.adobe.com/cfusion/
exchange/ to find a vast collection of extensions you can use to add behav-
iors and other features to Dreamweaver. To install them, use the Extensions 
Manager, which I cover in Chapter 10.
While you’re at the site, check out the growing collection of Adobe tutorials, 
updates, and resources at www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver. Among 
the resources, check out the new CSS section, where you’ll find the latest in 
CSS tips, tricks, and workarounds.
Dressing Up the Address Bar 
with a Favicon
Have you ever wondered how to add a custom graphic to the address bar at 
the top of browsers like Internet Explorer or Firefox? Google adds a capital G, 
Adobe adds its logo, and you can add an image, too. But first you have to get 
the image in the right format.
To convert an image into a Favicon, visit Favicon.com, where you can 
upload a graphic and have it converted for free. Then just add that image to 
the root level of your main site folder (that is, your local site folder). The next 
time you preview your page in a browser, the image automatically displays in 
the address bar.

W
hat if you build a Web site and nobody comes? Unfortunately, that’s 
an all-too-common problem on the Internet. And, that’s why I end this 
book by pointing you to a few places where you can promote your Web site. 
Driving significant traffic to the pages of a site requires a significant amount 
of time or money or an incredibly compelling message. If you can manage 
all three, you should do very well indeed. In this chapter, you find tips and 
online resources to help bring people to your Web site.
Scoring High in Search Engines
The buzzword here is search engine optimization, or SEO, a process designed 
to help you attract more attention from search engines like Google, Bing, and 
Yahoo! The goal is to get your site higher on the search results page than 
your competitors.
Scoring high in Web searches is complicated because millions of sites vie for 
the top spots and search engines use complex formulas to determine which 
Web site should match any given keyword search. Search engines also guard 

404
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
their formulas for prioritizing Web sites more carefully than Coca-Cola guards 
its recipe. And if that doesn’t make it complicated enough, most search 
engines change their formulas regularly. (How regularly is also secret.)
 
Thousands of companies and services promise to “get you in the top 10 
matches” on search engines for as little as $19.99. Be wary of these services. 
The truly good ones charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars per 
month (with good reason), and the bad ones can get you delisted from search 
engines for breaking the rules with old tricks like inserting the word sex into 
your code when you’re site is really about car maintenance. Most SEO experts 
agree that the best way to score high in search engines is to provide useful 
information on your site and to use appropriate keywords effectively.
For the most part, search engines score sites based on the words and images 
on Web pages and on how well a site’s content matches the keywords 
that are searched. For example, if you own a B&B in Point Reyes Station, 
California, you should include at least the name Point Reyes Station on your 
Web site because the term B&B has many competitors, and people searching 
for lodging in the area are likely to include the town’s name in their search.
 
A great way to determine how best to make your own site search engine 
friendly is to search for keywords that you want to lead people to your site 
and then study the Web sites that match those words already. Often, the best 
way to move your Web site up the ranks in search results is to emulate the 
strategies of other sites that are already doing well.
Achieving the best placement, especially for popular keywords, is a full-time 
job, but here are a few tips that most SEO specialists agree are likely to help 
you score better in search engine searches.
 
✓ Invite other sites to link to you. Popular belief is that Google rewards 
people who attract the most links to their sites, especially if those sites 
already have good rankings themselves. It makes sense: If lots of other 
Web sites consider your site good enough to send their visitors to you, 
you probably have something of value to offer. 
 
✓ Fill your site with fresh, original content related to your business 
or industry. Include tips, articles, tutorials, and other content that’s 
valuable to your visitors, and don’t stop there. Keeping your content 
updated by adding fresh information on a regular basis is another great 
way to keep search engines — and visitors — interested.
 
✓ Develop a list of keywords and a good description for your site. The 
trick to writing a good Web site description is making it concise (every 
word counts), packing it with your most important keywords, and phras-
ing it so that it reads like a sentence (not just a list of words). Include 
this description toward the top of your home page in the meta descrip-
tion tag, which is a special tag that can be used to add information just 
for search engines. (You find instructions for adding meta descriptions 
and keyword content in Chapter 2.)

 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
 
✓ Include your most important keywords in the title of your Web page 
and the name of the file. The title doesn’t appear in the body of a Web 
page; the title appears at the top of the browser window. You can add or 
edit the title of a page in Dreamweaver by changing the text in the Title 
field at the very top of the workspace. Similarly, including keywords in 
the filename of each page in your Web site can also boost rankings. 
 
✓ Include keywords in the headings on your Web page. Most search 
engines place higher priority on keywords that appear in the headings 
on a page, but only if you use XHTML heading tags to style those head-
lines. Heading tags, which include <h1> (the biggest) through <h6> 
(the smallest), identify text as headings in a way that search engines 
easily recognize. 
 
✓ Don’t expect instant (or permanent) results. Even if you do everything 
right in the search engine optimization game, you might still have to wait 
for the results of your efforts. Some search engines can take weeks or 
months to reflect changes to Web pages on the Internet. Search engines, 
such as Google, generally update the most popular sites very quickly 
while lagging weeks or months behind in updating less-visited sites.
 
A great place to learn more about how search engines work and how to 
achieve the best ranking is www.searchenginewatch.com.
Buying Traffic (Yes, You Really Can!)
In addition to the “natural” results that search engines deliver when someone 
does a keyword search, buying keywords on search engines helps to ensure 
that your site is listed when someone searches for words that are relevant to 
Why all this search engine secrecy?
The people who run sites like Google and Bing 
want to deliver the best results when someone 
conducts a search — not just a list of the sites 
that reflect smart Web marketers’ ability to 
figure out how to trick their way into top posi-
tion. Because much money can be made at the 
top of search results lists, Web marketers spend 
countless hours testing how search engines 
work to come up with their best guesses about 
the criteria that search engines are using and 
how best to move their sites up the list.
The result is sort of a cat-and-mouse game, 
with search engines changing the rules to 
thwart the most calculated efforts of special-
ists in SEO, and people who specialize in SEO 
charging big bucks to figure out the secret for-
mula that can put you on top.

your site, although the process is far more complex than most people realize. 
Search engine ads generally appear at the top and right side of most search-
result pages. 
Not all keywords sell for the same price. Using a complex bidding process, 
most search engines charge significantly more for the most popular key-
words. Adding to the complexity, the results of those keywords for your site 
can vary dramatically based on a dizzying array of factors. For example, the 
expensive keyword Hawaii may bring the most amount of traffic to your site, 
but the lower-priced keyword luau may result in more reservations to your 
hotel. Because it’s possible to measure not only the traffic from a keyword 
search but also the actions of the person who clicks that keyword, you can 
measure and compare the effectiveness of nearly every aspect of search 
engine advertising.
Again, this process can be highly complex. Just consider the following:
 
✓ The real art of developing a list of keywords for search engine adver-
tising requires more than just brainstorming a few words related to 
your business. The best SEO companies come up with hundreds or 
thousands of keywords and phrases and then track the results to find 
the best return on each dollar spent for the keywords (for example, how 
many paying customers arrive via each keyword or phrase and how 
much do they buy). Thus, running a campaign with 10,000 words might 
not cost much more than running a campaign with 100 words and might 
prove much more effective over time.
 
✓ The most sophisticated ad campaigns involve creating special Web 
pages to go with each keyword ad. For example, you can create a spe-
cial page (often called a landing page) on your Hawaiian hotel site for 
people who click on the search term scuba diving that is different from 
the page for those who click the search term health spa. 
You can learn more about how to make the most of your keyword ads by 
carefully reading the instructions and tips on any site where you plan to 
advertise.
 
Google AdSense offers the largest online advertising program for keywords. 
Just visit www.google.com/adsense to find detailed instructions and a 
number of tips and tools to help you develop the best campaign and measure 
the results.
In addition to buying ads on Google, you can include Google Ads on your own 
Web site to earn advertising income. This program is called Google AdWords, 
and you can learn more about it at http://adwords.google.com.

 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
Using Social Networking Sites 
for Promotion
Social networking, the art of meeting and building contacts on the Web, is 
an increasingly popular way to increase your personal and professional 
contacts, make new friends, develop professional relationships, and even 
find a new job. You can also use social networking sites to promote your per-
sonal or business Web site. Netiquette (Internet etiquette) calls for a subtle 
approach to promoting your site in these kinds of environments, but simply 
including your Web address in your online profile can help drive new people 
to your site. 
Here’s what you can expect to find among the most popular social network-
ing sites:
 
✓ Facebook: (www.facebook.com) Facebook wins top place as the 
fastest-growing social networking site on the Web, and its broad appeal 
makes it an excellent place to promote your Web site. Facebook was 
originally considered a vanity site and a place for college students, but 
its professional power is growing with its ever-expanding audience.
 
✓ LinkedIn: (www.linkedin.com) This is the site for professional con-
nections and online business networking. If you’re online to develop 
business contacts with other professionals, especially if you’re job hunt-
ing or trying to attract new business clients, this is a powerful place to 
promote yourself and your Web site. Unlike Facebook and MySpace, 
LinkedIn is all business.
 
✓ MySpace: (www.myspace.com) One of the all-time most popular social 
networking sites, MySpace, enables you to create a profile site, add 
music, write a blog, and post as many photos as you want to share with 
the world. Although the site has dominated the social networking land-
scape on the Internet, at the time of this writing, it was rapidly falling 
behind its biggest competitor, Facebook. Still, its huge online audience is 
a popular place for musicians, performers, and many others to promote 
themselves and their Web sites.
 
✓ Ecademy: (www.ecademy.com) Similar to LinkedIn, Ecademy is a site 
where professionals network, seek new clients, hunt for jobs, and recruit 
employees. What makes Ecademy different is that it’s much more inter-
national, with an especially strong audience in Europe and Asia.
 
✓ Ning: (www.ning.com) You can create your own social networking site 
at Ning and invite your friends and colleagues to create profiles there in 
your own exclusive social network environment.

408
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Twitter: (www.twitter.com) Best described as “microblogging,” 
Twitter makes it easy to connect with people online and share brief 
bursts of information, called tweets. Twitter limits you to no more than 
140 characters per post, which may seem restrictive at first, but seems 
to be the secret to Twitter’s success. Because you can post to Twitter 
from a computer, cell phone, or any other Internet-enabled device, and 
because the posts are so brief, people tend to update Twitter more 
frequently than other services, making it a great place to follow trends, 
news events, and other information in real time. 
Ranking on Social Bookmarking Sites
Social bookmarking sites rank the popularity of Web pages by the number 
of votes they get. The result is that these sites are excellent resources for 
people who want to keep up with what’s popular online. Most enable anyone 
to vote on a site.
Getting your site listed on social bookmarking sites is a highly effective way 
to increase traffic. Dozens of these sites and services exist, with more sure to 
come, and they feature catchy and unusual names, like Digg (http://digg.
com), delicious (http://delicious.com), StumbleUpon (www.stumble
upon.com), and reddit (www.reddit.com). 
 
Although you can submit your own pages on any of these sites, it’s generally 
frowned upon, and if you do it too frequently, you can be banned. Besides, 
your one little vote won’t make much difference anyway. A better method is 
to add a button to your site from each of these services so that visitors can 
easily vote for you. If you’re a blogger, you can add a button each time you 
post. You can get the buttons (called chicklets) for free and add them to your 
pages by simply inserting a little code you generate on the social networking 
site.
Enticing Visitors to Return for Updates
One of the best ways to improve traffic to your site is through repeat visitors, 
and regular updates to your site can make all the difference. If you want your 
visitors to know when to look for updates, consider making regular changes 
to your Web site. Add a post to your blog every Thursday morning, for exam-
ple, or post your newest photos to the site on Saturday mornings. Regular 
updates help get people in the habit of visiting your site.

409
 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
Gathering Ideas from Other Web Sites
One of the best ways to create good habits in Web design is to visit other 
people’s Web sites and study what works and what doesn’t on their pages, 
with special attention to the following: 
 
✓ Check out the title of the page, any descriptive text, or keywords that 
are used throughout the site. 
 
✓ Ask yourself what you like about the site and why you like it. 
 
✓ Determine whether you can easily find the information you’re most 
interested in and how easily you can navigate around the site.
Sometimes the best way to discover the problems in your own Web site is 
to look for problems on someone else’s site and then return to yours with a 
fresh perspective. 
Marketing a Web Site to the Media
Attracting traditional media attention to your Web site is like attracting it to 
any other business. The trick is to tell a good story and get the attention of 
someone who can write about it in a publication that your target audience 
reads. If you’re looking for press coverage, make sure to include a Press sec-
tion on your Web site with contact information, story ideas, and any other 
press coverage you’ve received.
 
Don’t wait for journalists to come to you! You should never pester a reporter 
with a barrage of e-mails, press releases, or phone calls, but a well-timed 
or well-pitched message can get the attention of a reporter and the desired 
result — your Web address in the press. One good way to find journalists who 
might be interested in your site is to visit related sites and study their Press sec-
tions to find out who has been writing about the site. Note not only the publica-
tion but also the writer. Then send a note directly to that person with a message 
that starts like this:
Dear fabulous journalist <insert that person’s name, of course>:
I enjoyed reading the article you wrote on the XYZ company and thought 
that you might be interested in what we’re doing.
Keep your message brief, and try to include a news hook and story idea that 
go beyond just promoting your business. For example, rather than tell a 
reporter that you have the best B&B site in northern California, pitch a story 
about the best hikes in the area. With any luck, the article on great hikes will 
include a quote from you and a mention of your B&B’s Web site (especially if 
the reporter can send readers to your online list of hiking tips).

Unleashing the Power of Viral Marketing
Viral marketing is another of the marketing industry’s buzzwords in the 
digital age. The idea is that a message (a video, an article, or a photo, for 
example) is so exciting, fun, and compelling that people want to share it with 
each other, passing it on to their friends, who then pass it on to their friends, 
until it spreads like a virus. Such messages are often sent via e-mail, blogs, or 
chat, which can make the ever-expanding impact happen at an almost instan-
taneous pace.
Tap in to the power of viral marketing, and you can become an overnight sen-
sation. Humor seems to be the most effective strategy. Among the mainstays 
of the viral phenomena are those silly photos of cats with clever sayings. 
Known as the LOL cats, these photos have spawned several Web sites, like 
Icanhascheeseburger.com. Funny video clips — the kind you would expect to 
see featured on a show like America’s Funniest Home Videos — are also highly 
viral because they’re shared around the Web.
To use viral marketing to attract traffic to your Web site, include a section 
with funny photos, industry jokes, or a Top 10 list, and you might just get 
visitors to tell their friends about your site.
Blogging, Blogging, Blogging
By creating a blog for your Web site, you can easily add fresh content. Blogs 
are designed for frequent updates, and when you become a blogger, you also 
join the ranks of a prolific group of writers who regularly refer their readers 
to each other’s Web sites.
 
Don’t launch a blog without considering the commitment it requires. For your 
blog to attract traffic and serve as an effective marketing tool, you must 
 
✓ Feature interesting, relevant information for your audience. 
 
✓ Update the blog regularly. 
 
✓ Take the time to participate in other people’s blogs. Adding relevant tips 
and thoughtful comments to other people’s blogs is an excellent way to 
get their visitors to come back to your Web site.

 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
Using Twitter to Promote Your Site
One of the most popular new forms of social media can be found at www.
twitter.com., Twitter makes it easy to register and start sharing your 
words of wisdom, but you have to keep it brief — a way of posting called 
microblogging. Twitter limits users to 140 characters (about a sentence) of 
text per post. At first, many users complained that Twitter was a trivial place 
where people shared too many boring details, such as, “I’m going to lunch at 
my favorite diner now.”
But Twitter has evolved into an incredibly popular way for friends to stay 
in touch and for businesses, actors, and others to promote themselves. Just 
visit www.twitter.com, and register for a free account. Then you can start 
posting short messages about what you’re doing, what you’re thinking, or 
questions you’re pondering. After you sign up, you can also subscribe to the 
Twitter feed of anyone else who uses Twitter and thus see others’ comments, 
called tweets, in a real-time stream on your home page.
Telling Everyone You Know
Many people are either too shy or too busy to reach out to their friends, family, 
and personal contacts when they launch a Web site. Don’t overlook your most 
obvious supporters. Launching a new Web site or redesigning an existing site 
is an excellent excuse to e-mail personal and professional contacts. To make 
the announcement even more fun, consider sending an e-card with a colorful 
character, animation, or music to dramatize your announcement.
Hallmark.com is one of my favorite e-card sites because it has lots of free 
cards with clever sayings, professional designs, and interactive animations. 
Most of its free e-cards even include sound. BlueMountain.com is another 
useful e-card site, but you have to pay for the pleasure of sending its profes-
sional greetings. When choosing an e-card to announce your Web site, look 
for blank cards or the Friendship and Any Occasion sections, where you can 
find messages that are easily personalized for nearly any kind of Web site.
 
Make sure you include your URL on all your marketing and other materials, 
too. Prominently display your Web address on your business cards, bro-
chures, stationery, and anywhere else you promote your business (such as 
your e-mail signature).
